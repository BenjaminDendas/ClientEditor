1|Champion of the Slain|Sigrun||
2|Eternal Youth|Serif|Don't be fooled by his spritely appearance - Serif is a warrior spirit with the courage to take on any foe. Darting through the air, he strikes with powerful punches and lightning attacks that leave enemies reeling.|
3|Cheery Sylph|Merrilee|Merrilee's bubbly personality and can-do attitude make her a perfect partner. She does her best to keep you safe with defensive spells and healing magics, but she can also turn the tables on foes with vicious ice attacks.|
4|Daring Dragon|Grimm|A recently-hatched dragon, Grimm doesn't let his size prevent him from displaying the confidence and tenacity of a full-grown drake. He enjoys zipping around enemies, body-slamming them in between blasts of torching flame.|
5|Regal Unicorn|Alessa|A svelte scion of unicorn nobility, Alessa possesses sacred powers that can purify ailments and heal injuries. The regal horn protruding from her forehead isn't just for show, either - she wields it with the deftness of a fencer's blade.|
101|Iron Titan|Gigas|Wrought of enchanted iron by a civilization long lost to memory, Gigas feels no pain and yields to no opponent. It is said that, in recognition of its strength and valor, the gods gave it a hero's soul, allowing it to exist eternally.|
102|Knight of the Sun|Aelius|A mysterious hooded knight emblazoned with the sun's crest, Aelius brings to bear his shining power to defend his allies with shields of pure light and incinerate the enemies before him with prominences of intense solar heat.|
103|Nova Warrior|Abraxas|When his body was badly damaged in the war between Pandemonium and the Aura Kingdom, angelic champion Abraxas was given new life in a powerful bio-armor. He aids those who seek victory in Gaia's name, and fights with a heavenly strength and grace.|
104|Wandering Guardian|Higa|Wanderer of all realms and planes, Higa's flamboyant appearance belies his role as a protector in matters of the spirit world. From bodyguard to siege-breaker, he mounts a powerful offense from a bracing defense, and has recently added humans to his clientele.|
105|Knight of Shadows|Rhodri|Clad in a hooded cowl and dark armor, Rhodri's presence sets a chill in the bones. Some claim him an agent of Pandemonium in the mortal realm; others say he seeks a duel with the Knight of the Sun. Only one thing is certain: death follows in his wake.|
106|Duke of Darkness|Eligos|The shadowy Eligos is a Grand Duke of Pandemonium, but with a nobler temperament than many denizens of that forsaken realm. He seeks to train any willing Envoys of Gaia in his powerful dark arts, and claims he can foresee the outcome of any battle.|
107|Champion of the Slain|Sigrun|Sigrun is a mighty warrior-maiden who combs battlefields for the souls of the fallen. She escorts the spirits of dead heroes to a plane beyond the mortal world and avenges the deaths of noble warriors who have been wrongfully slain.|
108|Seat of Judgment|Nalani|A potentate who travels between the Aura Kingdom and the mortal realm, Nalani weighs justice and mercy, meting out judgment on humans and spirits, both living and dead. She is adept at harnessing the full might of holy energy, and foes quake at her radiant light.|
109|Heavenly Defender|Uzuriel|A messenger descended from the splendor of the Aura Kingdom, Uzuriel pledges her aid only to those who prove worthy. Favoring swift strikes to thundering blows, her holy winds uplift allies and subdue foes with a brilliant flourish.|
110|Demon Temptress|Tanith|A demon warrior from Pandemonium, Tanith finds beauty and liberty in satiating one's own desires. She crossed over to help humans free their hearts from rigid moral codes, promising to show them the pleasure of frenzied battle, and a few other things besides.|
111|High Executor|Maja|A liaison between Pandemonium and the mortal realm, Maja's appearance is said to foretell disaster and destruction. Envoys who would ally with her must possess iron wills, but their tenacity will be rewarded with her command of dark magics and nefarious energies.|
112|Empress of Torment|Bel-Chandra|Known throughout Pandemonium as the Empress of Torment, Bel-Chandra harnesses fearful magic that wracks the bodies of her enemies in terrible agony. Drawn to the hidden darkness in mortals' hearts, she whispers emboldening words, encouraging mercilessness in battle.|
113|Stormbringer|Vayu|High above the clouds, Vayu the Stormbringer causes winds to blow and rains and snows to fall. Some attribute to him both droughts and floods, as well as times of great prosperity. When he descends to earth, lesser spirits tremble at his coming.|
114|Great Leviathan|Nazrudin|One of the grand dragons of the sea, Nazrudin is a master of water in all its forms. The sight of his white, serpentine body in flight is said to be a fortuitous omen to sailors, but if his wrath is awakened, he can sweep away a fleet as though it were chaff.|
115|Emerald Tempest|Yarnaros|Once a warlord, Yarnaros was cursed with a draconian form. Resisting the anger in his heart, he instead championed the weak and subdued demons, until at last the gods lifted him up, giving him golden wings and the power to shake the earth and sky.|
116|Flamecaller|Ghodroon|Dwelling in magmatic caverns far beneath the world's surface, the great dragon Ghodroon has the power to sear foes with boiling lava and superheated ash. He has a fondness for gems and precious metals, and will begrudgingly work with select humans to increase his hoard.|
117|Miasmic Serpent|Quelkulan|The dead marshes of Pandemonium are Quelkulan's domain. A powerful electric current courses through this fearsome wyrm's coils, and it can vent an incredibly toxic miasma capable of dissolving flesh and bone, and killing even mystical creatures.|
118|Infernal Efreet|Zaahir|A powerful efreet from the world of spirits, Zaahir gained notoriety among the djinn for his cunning, ruthlessness, and his ambition to rule. With his otherworldly savvy, he allies with those who, like him, will stop at nothing to achieve power.|
119|Gallant Crusader|Cyril|Galloping swiftly through field and plain, Cyril wanders the world looking for worthy causes to which he might pledge his aid. Although a just spirit, his blade holds nothing back against evil, and his speed is like the rush of an oncoming storm.

Cyril's armor is as hard as a diamond, and is able to withstand the most ferocious attacks. When he strikes with his weapon, the Sword in the Stone, the air itself transforms into Wind Blades that strike and scatter his foes, and his King's Favor skill bolsters his allies' defensive abilities. Clearly, his legendary title, King of the Knights, is well-deserved.|
120|Nine-Tailed Vixen|Kotonoha|As a nine-tailed fox spirit, Kotonoha wields powerful and esoteric spells with ease, chanting secret mantras to defend her partner, or applying magical wards that greatly enhance combat prowess. Her keen eyes can pierce illusions to see the reality beneath.|
121|Feline Emperor|Tigerius Caesar|The noble soul of Emperor Tigerius Caesar, lord of beasts, was preserved by the gods in an everlasting body. He expertly balances his regal bearing with his desire for the finest things in life, like royal buffets, servant girls, and of course, cat naps.|
122|Trampling Thunder|Bahadur|In the vast wildernesses of Terra, Bahadur roams far afield, seeking wars and strong challengers to quell his lust for battle. As a centaur, few spirits can match the speed of his trampling gallop, and fewer still are willing to face his thunderous charge.|
123|Silent Assassin|Tsubaki|A master assassin given new life as a heroic spirit, Tsubaki specializes in espionage and combat medicine. She can quickly apply treatments that ease fatigue or let one drain a foe's life. With powerful chakra and a host of self-made drugs, she is an excellent - if dangerous - ally.|
124|Panther Pharaoh|Cleopawtra|Last of the feline queens, Cleopawtra's beauty was such that after her death, the gods granted her a new life. With her mercurial temperament, she can be a difficult partner, but rewards loyalty with a display of her might. 

Brave and shrewd, Cleopawtra can approach her targets soundlessly. When the time is right, she strikes with her Icy Claw skill, wounding and freezing her target at the same time.|
125|Moonlight Maiden|Serena|Serena travels the night sky on her giant moon, sketching the world as she sees it below. She is the sister of the Eidolon Aelius, but their relations seem to be on rocky ground. Nevertheless, her lunar magic always shines bright to illuminate allies' way to victory.|
126|Midnight Witch|Endora|Endora knows she's totally the hottest witch in the spirit realm...her rivals who call her bratty are just jealous! She flies into action with terrifying pumpkin magic and her gigantic scythe, but her toughest challenge is the battle to win Serif's heart.|
127|Phoenix Enchantress|Vermilion|Living in opulent splendor in a grand palace beyond the spirit realm's southern sky, Vermilion had everything she wanted...except adventure. Taking matters into her own hands, she decided to join forces with a worthy Envoy of Gaia and see the rich tapestry of the mortal world for herself.

With an affinity for blazing fire and a knack for wide-radius spell blasts, Vermilion is all too happy to dance her way to red-hot victory. She's a wise spirit but a complete newbie to the world of Terra, so she always has a unique perspective on even seemingly mundane events.|
128|Lady of Evening Snow|Shirayuki|With an impeccable sense of manners and propriety, elegant beauty that holds the gaze of men and women alike, and great skill in poetry and music, Shirayuki has captured the hearts of all in the wintry realm from which she hails. Will those in the mortal realm appreciate her exacting aesthetic tastes?

Able to manipulate snow and ice at her whim, she uses her harsh assault to wear enemies down, but her skill as an entertainer also allows her to bolster the power of her allies. Naturally, Shirayuki finds this elegant balance between offense and defense the most fitting.|
129|Blazing Justice|Kaiser Zeta|Born of the soul of an ancient engineer whose name has been lost to the ages, Kaiser Zeta carries the eternal hopes and dreams of youth in his robotic shell. He has burst forth from the spirit realm intent on teaching people the power of truth, justice, teamwork, and striking incredible action poses.

As a mechanical construct, Kaiser Zeta's alloyed body grants him strong defense, and he can spread a protective field over allies, reducing the damage they take. His greatest technique, however, is combining with an Envoy like a suit of armor to battle with blazing passion.|
130|Queen of Shadow|Hel|As one of the regents of Pandemonium's sprawling netherworld, Hel keeps family close and her allies closer. Her beauty has won her many admirers, but made her distrustful of others' intentions, and while she chooses her words wisely, her tongue can have a razor's edge.

Hel specializes in short-range, brutally damaging combat. Her hot kisses can, when blown, detonate with incredible destructive power. She also puts her limber legs to effective use, lashing foes with lightning-fast flurries of kicks.|
131|Dragon Tyrant|Alucard|Alucard is a mysterious Eidolon, never before sighted in Terra, Pandemonium, or the Aura Kingdom. He is thought to be a world-walker, and some say his coming heralds calamity for the world. He has a calculating personality and talks down to those he considers lesser beings.

Supremely confident in his power, Alucard whips around his dual blades with tremendous force in his debonair 'human' form. However, it is when he assumes his draconian form that he truly crackles with the power to crush all who stand before him - mortals, spirits, and Eidolons alike.|
132|God of Light|Bealdor|Bealdor is the God of Light, illuminating all the world. Coddled and sheltered by his mother since he was young, he neglected worldly affairs. This offended Hel, who began to resent him.   

Bealdor's mother once asked all the world's creatures to swear an oath not to harm him. They agreed, and he became impervious to danger. Now he can stand at the front line of any battle without fear. His powers of destruction are not to be underestimated. When he brandishes his longsword, Skee - made from the first rays of the dawn - he can perform quick and furious attacks. As an Eidolon, he is considered proficient in both attack and defense.|
133|Spirit of the Sword|Kusanagi|Kusanagi is the sword spirit of the creator god Amaterasu. Legend says that whoever obtains her will conquer all things under heaven. Amaterasu sent Kusanagi to Terra to help those who would seek to save the world. 

Kusanagi transformed herself into a sword spirit with a tremendous appitude for battle. She can carry out storm attacks on large numbers of enemies. When rallying together with an Envoy of Gaia, she can launch a destructive laser cannon attack over a broad area. A deep-seated confidence (some would say overconfidence) spurs her to challenge formidable opponents, because she knows that each battle will only make her stronger.|
134|Gruesome Twosome|Hansel and Gretel|Hansel and Gretel were drawn to Terra via the Power of Gaia. With the blessing of the forest at their command, they harness the energy of storm and wind. Hansel possesses a keen sense of smell and the ability to vanquish gigantic foes. Gretel, on the other hand, is gifted with tremendous healing abilities.

When they blow their horn, they are able to restore their allies' health, allowing them to keep fighting the good fight.|
135|Goddess of War|Astraea|Having never lost a battle, Astraea has long been renowned as the goddess of victory and war. She's tactically sage and courageous to a fault, though deep down she wishes for nothing but peace. Now, she descends from the heavens in order to protect those whom she holds dear...

In her right hand, Astraea wields a stalwart lance of silvery pallor that can penetrate the armor of even the toughest opponents. With her left hand, she defends herself with a holy shield of ornate, golden inlay that proves impervious to all attacks. The sacred power of her lance allows her to not only bring down explosive judgment on her enemies, but restore the health of her comrades as well. Astraea never forgets those whom she must protect and those who fight beside her... which is why she has yet to lose a single battle.|
136|Mistress of Moonshadow|Cesela|Cesela streaks across the night sky on a blazing star, landing next to the Envoy of Gaia with the force of a fallen comet. In the pitch-black of pure night, Cesela pulses with an Eidolon's mysterious power.

Cesela dominates the night sky, harnessing the raw energy of the stars. This cosmic power, once compressed, deals massive Dark DMG to enemies. Harnessing the power of the moon, her enemies are unable to heal. Having her by your side is a surefire way to guarantee victory!|
137|Luminous Beauty|Diao Chan|This alluring beauty hails from the mysterious East and uses her magical fan to command the divine winds. Though many have tried to court her, there is only one whom she truly loves. 

In battle, Diao Chan harnesses the power of the wind to unleash devastating attacks on enemy forces. She can also use her fan to restore her allies' health. In the struggle to help the one she loves, there's nothing Diao Chan won't do.|
