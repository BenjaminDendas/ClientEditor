24100|Emotions are running high as the area buzzes with activity.|
24101|After undergoing many challenges, you are finally on your way to confront the Winged Duke.|
24102|You, Odum, and Alex prepare yourselves as you await his arrival.|
24103|Challenge and defeat the Winged Duke with Odum and Alex!|
24104|The demonic beast guards have spotted you, and they launch an attack!|
24105|Suddenly, in a burst of dark energy, the Winged Duke appears.|
24124|After speaking with you, the maiden picks up her bow again.|
24125|After speaking with you, the teenager picks up his bow again.|
24127|Jason summons an unknown creature using the synthesized orb.|
24128|After speaking, the demon casts a teleportation spell and disappears.|
24129|Jason mutters something unintelligible and runs off.|
24130|With her hands trembling, Velisha wields the sword and attacks the Forest Tanuki.|
24131|Velisha collapses with exhaustion as you fire her weapon.|
24132|You use the Firebreath Wand to destroy the Incantation Totem.|
24133|The Forest Tanuki turns to Velisha and begins explaining the importance of nature and the preciousness of life.|
24134|The Forest Tanuki also stresses the need for mutual cooperation between humans and nature.|
24136|When you awaken, Velisha and the Forest Tanuki are gone. How strange...|
24137|After speaking, the demon takes the Sword of the King and disappears.|
24138|The yeti seems happy to follow you. Lead him back to Buzz!|
24139|After he finishes talking, Buzz throws the ball.|
24140|You successfully planted the banner at the meteor crater. Troop morale is at an all-time high!|
24141|After eating the apple, Jonissa turns into a Snow Sprite.|
24142|The Dragonwing has fully recovered after using the energy tonic.|
24143|The mysterious stone falls into place, and you can hear something move deep within the mechanism.|
24144|You can place a Photography Crystal here.|
24145|You sound the horn, and it echoes across the valley. Unsure whether this did the trick, you blow the horn a second time.|
24146|After blowing the horn a third time, an angry bear appears from nowhere and attacks.|
24150|The Furious Goddess Servitor appears in response to your desecration of the holy statue.|
24152|The bluebird happily returns to its owner.|
24153|Forest Tanuki: Human! I can sense that you are a kind-hearted soul. Can you do me a favor and calm her down?|
24154|The teary-eyed maiden speaks to you happily.|
24155|The teenager gleefully grabs your hand.|
24156|Velisha reluctantly reaches down to pick a nearby flower.|
24157|Before Velisha can pick the flower, a Forest Tanuki appears.|
24158|Velisha leaps back in fright and prepares for an attack.|
24159|You sheathe your weapon and look at the Forest Tanuki.|
24160|You tell the Yeti about Buzz.|
24161|Jonissa happily grabs the apple and takes a bite.|
24162|You place your hand on the sword and remove it effortlessly.|
24163|You spot a soldier grilling something nearby. You think he may know something about the bluebird, so you ask him.|
24164|You've found the dead body of an adventurer on the side of the road. Go bury it.|
24165|You can hardly believe what happens next.|
24190|The enraged Winged Duke summons dimensional lightning and thunder.|
24191|Anyone struck by the dimensional powers will have higher Dark DMG.|
24192|You prepare yourself for the final blow that will conquer this evil once and for all.|
24193|It's just as you thought! The Winged Duke uses the same tricks on you as he did on the Second Prince!|
24194|After much hard work, the Winged Duke has been found!|
24195|After some brief preparations, you, Odum, and Alex make your way to the northwest corner of Highland Cemetery along with the troops.|
24196|At this critical moment, Odum uses all his strength to break free of the Winged Duke's control.|
24197|The Winged Duke disappears, but you can still feel his presence - malignant and omniscient.|
24198|You fight the good fight, and after a long, grueling battle, you finally emerge victorious. The Duke, now sluggish and powerless, has been defeated.|
24199|Just as you're about to congratulate yourself on a job well done, you feel an intense, chaotic energy permeate the air.|
24200|A powerful whirlwind of sparkling energy enshrouds the Winged Duke. It lasts not but a moment or two before dissipating, but upon its departure, you discover the Winged Duke is nowhere to be found.|
24201|Another army of beasts appears. You'll have to defeat them to coerce the dastardly Winged Duke to come out of hiding!|

24230|Andre: "Just where do you think YOU'RE going?!"|
24231|Von: "Cloddish troglodyte! Prepare to meet your doom! Feast your eyes upon my visage! Cower before my unholy power!"|
24232|You hear the sound of fighting from up ahead.|

24244|You think about what might have happened that requires your assistance.
A multitude of questions clouds your mind as you make your way towards Hurd Military Base.|
24245|Everything will be made clear once you speak with Shay.|
24246|The anticipation, however, is killing you, so you quickly hurry towards the base.|
24247|The traitor seems unwilling to surrender, so you slam your letter down in front of him.|
24248|Could it be? A flash of remorse? Your persuasion tactics have proved successful!|
24249|Hm, seems like he still won't budge. Take him out!|
24250|You carefully kindle a tiny flame and use it to set fire to the trash pile.|
24251|Keep burning more trash! Let's see those flames lick the sky!|
24252|You burn another pile of trash. The flames are soaring!|
24253|More, more, more! Let's build a raging inferno!|
24254|You've burned so much trash, the fire is now out of control! What magnificent conflagration!|
24255|Report back to Mia about your successful arson.|
24256|Sharuti thanks you for recovering Palo's weapon.|
24257|You rest for a while before deciding to head out.|
24258|Head back to the Starstruck Plateau base and tell Caresha about what happened.|
24259|Von suddenly emerges from the Dimensional Fissure, and the air around you grows cold.|
24260|Von: "YAAAAARGH!!!"|
24261|Von lets out an earth-shattering roar and mutates into an enormous dragon of ice.|
24262|The Winged Duke springs into action and uses his infernal power to wrangle the lot of you into his grasp.|
24263|All of a sudden, a bolt of lightning crackles through the air, interrupting Von's concentration.|
24264|The three Dragon Kings of Thunder, Gale, and, Deluge, appear in front of you.|
24265|The Winged Duke reappears! Waves of crushing energy undulate from his every pore.|
24266|The Shadow Knight uses the Cube of Gaia to begin Luciana's resurrection ritual.|
24267|Just as the Shadow Knight glances away, Victoria rushes forward towards Luciana.|
24268|The Magic Circle, however, stops her in her tracks.|
24269|Maggie focuses all of her energy into casting a powerful spell.|
24270|The spell kills Maggie and the soldiers, and the Shadow Knight is able to escape.|
24271|Let's go! We must stop the Shadow Knight!|
24272|Yaaahh--!!|
24273|You follow closely behind the Winged Duke, not wanting to lose him, as you begin storing up energy.|
24274|You can't help but think back to your fight against Frederic the Archangel in Wrathborne Temple - this time will be no different!|
24275|So many memories come rushing back as you walk amongst the tribe you once knew so well.|
24276|But those wonderful memories are gone. That despicable traitor has destroyed everything!|
24277|The time for justice is nigh, and you shall be the one to stamp, mail, and deliver it!|
24278|You know just where to find him, too.|
24279|In the main tent - the one normally reserved for the chief.|
24280|You follow the signs along the path.|
24281|All of a sudden, one of the guards from up ahead spots you.|
24282|Stop right there! Just what do you think you're doing here?|
24283|I'll claw out your trachea, scum!|
24284|Don't think you're getting out of here alive!|
24285|This relentless band of traitors isn't going to give up! Go punish them.|
24286|You're in the process of cleaning your weapon from the kill when you hear a voice from behind you. It's laden with disdain.|
24287|Oh, if it isn't Klaus!|
24288|And so SKILLED, yes? Someone's been diligent in their training.|
24289|But alas, it won't be enough. Consider it an honor to fall before me...|
24290|Or are you going to run away again, just like the little dog you are?!|
24291|You'll pay for what you've done here, traitor!|
24292|Take out the leader of the Silverflash Tribe Traitors!|
24293|You watch the foul infidel fall to the ground in a heap. Just as you're taking a breath of relief, you hear footsteps approach from behind you...|
24294|Shay looks forlornly at the corpse.|
24295|Not even those of great strength can resist the lure of power and prestige.|
24296|Perhaps, now, those that suffered thanks to his tyranny will be able to rest in peace...|
24297|You nod to Shay in agreement.|
24298|The quest is complete, and it's time to return to Hurd Military Base.|
24299|You feel like a giant weight has been lifted off your shoulders as you walk.|
24300|It wasn't easy, but you were able to pull off the mission without a hitch.|
24301|Unbeknownst to you, however, the traitor still lurks...|
24302|As you pour the Forest Essence into the brazier, you feel it begin to grow warm.|
24303|You pour more and more of the essence into the brazier.|
24304|The more your pour, the warmer it grows, and the flame billows and expands.|
24305|Tell Erika that the flames in the brazier have grown larger.|
24306|The soldier thanks you for killing the Aerial Scouts and saving his life.|
24307|The soldier thanks you for killing the Aerial Raiders and saving him.|
24308|Keep it up! Take out as many Aerial Scouts and Raiders as you can!|
24309|By order of the Shadow Knight, you shall perish! Time to kiss this world goodbye, Maggie!|
24310|The Aerial Assassin, it's--!! Coming straight towards you!|
24311|Quickly! Take out the Aerial Assassin!|
24312|The Snowmountain Yeti is furious right now. You'd better get yourself a Tattooed Yeti disguise before you head over.|
24313|You quickly replace the damaged energy core with a new one.|
24314|The pilot checks the energy levels again, then thanks you before returning to the fight.|
24315|I'm incredibly grateful. Now I can carry on with my fight!|
24316|You open the detector, and everything seems to be in order. You hide it away in a corner where no one will find it.|
24317|Install the detector on the right side of the Dark Fortress.|
24318|You open the detector, and everything seems to be in order. You hide it away in a corner where no one will find it.|
24319|You finish setting up the Detector. Hurry back and report to Augustus!|
24320|Teleporter: "Commencing teleportation sequence. Destination: Ice Crystal Forest."|
24321|Teleporter: "Commencing teleportation sequence. Destination: Silent Mountain."|
24322|Teleporter: "Commencing teleportation sequence. Destination: Dark Fortress Bridge."|
24323|You ignite the smoke bomb and gently place it into the pen.|
24324|Dashing away, you hide yourself in some nearby bushes to watch the events unfold.|
24325|The boars don't seem to notice the smoke at first, merely bumbling about and busying themselves as usual.|
24326|Finally, one of the boars notices the billowing smoke and wanders over to investigate.|
24327|A few of the boars begin bickering, still others stand around, sniffing the air and glancing at each other curiously.|
24328|As the smoke continues to thicken, you notice a change in the boars' mannerisms.|
24329|They grow sluggish, languid, and finally, fall asleep one by one, snoring loudly.|
24330|Mission success! The boars are all fast asleep, and they won't be waking up any time soon.|
24331|Patting yourself on the back, you decide to head out.|
24332|You sneak away from your hiding spot to avoid being spotted by the guards.|
24333|You should report to Klaus and tell him you successfully incapacitated the boars.|
24334|The Inscribed Magic Circle pulses with increasing intensity, as though trying to offset the power of the Anti-Magic Rune.|
24335|You cautiously approach the center of the Inscribed Magic Circle, readying the Anti-Magic Rune.|
24336|Suddenly the Anti-Magic Rune begins to glow, shining brightly as it floats toward the center of the circle.|
24337|The two streams of energy collide, creating a series of blinding light beams.|
24338|The rune purges the dark magic, steadily weakening the power of the Magic Circle.|
24339|The light from the rune shimmers as it cleanses the area of any and all residual dark magic.|
24340|Finally, the two energy streams fizzle out with identical hisses, leaving behind nothing but traces of clean, holy energy.|
24341|Finally the dark magic is extinguished, and the Circle is completely destroyed.|
24342|Gone are the palpitatious energy pulses, and gone is the claustrophobic pressure that had grown tight around your lungs.|
24343|Now that the circle is no more, you decide it's high time you vacated the premises.|
24344|Carefully avoiding detection, you make your way back to base.|
24345|You should quickly find Alex and tell him of the circle's destruction.|
24346|After confirming the teleportation spell's location with Maggie, you take the rune there.|
24347|The Darkwing Servants and their master, the Darkwing Steward, have the teleportation spell. Find them and destroy them!|
24348|The spell should be somewhere towards the front, but the Darkwing Steward will no doubt be behind the Dark Mist Wall.|
24349|Darkwing Servants lurk nearby, lending their power to the spell. You must defeat them to destroy the Dark Mist Wall!|
24350|Take out the Darkwing Servants before facing the Darkwing Steward.|
24351|As you approach, several Darkwing Servants spot you, giving loud shrieks as they swoop to block your path.|
24352|Take out every single one of those Darkwing varmints!|
24353|You watch the final Darkwing Servant fall to the ground with a thud, and almost immediately, the Dark Mist Wall fizzles into nothingness.|
24354|Now, only the Darkwing Steward remains...|
24355|You successfully trounce the Darkwing Steward, and in doing so, dismantle the teleportation spell.|
24356|The strange energy that had been buzzing through the air slowly dissipates.|
24357|With no more spell to supply it power, the Teleport Gate blinks into inexistence.|
24358|Whew! That takes care of that.|
24359|Time to skedaddle if you don't want to run into anymore of those Darkwing Servants.|
24360|You sneak your way to the exit and manage to avoid detection.|
24361|Now, get back to the base and report the good news to Squad Leader Mildew!|
24362|You follow the signs along the path.|
24363|You feel the Power of Gaia flowing through your veins react to the spell. It's warm at first, then seems to swell and pulsate, breaking you free from the Winged Duke's control.|
24364|"Well done! No doubt, this power will prove useful in your coming battle. Liven things up a bit, you know."|
24365|Quite suddenly, the Winged Duke reappears before you, limbs in a flurry as he peppers you with blows.|
24366|You feel yourself weaken, body succumbing to the onslaught.|
24367|Everything has returned to normal, at last, and Alex is now free from the spell.|
24368|The Winged Duked might have escaped, but at least his plans were kept from coming to fruition.|
24369|You decide to head on back to the base and begin discussing your next course of action.|
24370|Reports indicate the Cube of Gaia is buried somewhere on Silent Mountain. This is a huge development!|
24371|You, too, wonder just what significance this bit of information could hold as you make your way back to camp.|
24372|You should find Victoria and run through the current situation.|
24373|You hold the rune aloft, and its imprisoning enchantments render the steward unable to move. His face contorts in rage.|
24374|How dare you stand in my way? You'll pay for this!|
24375|The Darkwing Steward seems pressed. Take him out!|
24376|Andre and his squad have set up a temporary stronghold within the cave.|
24377|They're now engaged in battle with an immortal creature most foul.|
24378|An icy storm blocks the path ahead of you. You'll have to find another way around.|
24379|Von: "Fascinating! A little rat has made its way through the maze. Woe, woe, woe is me."|
24380|Andre: "Quit your yammering and just give up already, Von! We've got you surrounded!"|
24381|The eerie chill in the air tickles the hair on the back of your neck. Those giant, icy sculptures are giving you the creeps!|
24382|Von: "Not bad, human. Yes, yes, I'd be glad to entertain you..."|
24383|Andre: "The spear of justice shall impale all who stand in its way!"|
24384|The Shadow Knight clenches his hand around his Crimson Magic Square, and a fierce, sanguine light bursts from its edges. A nearby soldier lets out a tiny squawk before collapsing to the ground. You see faint tendrils of energy spiral away from his body.|
24385|All of a sudden, the particles in the air seem to freeze. Even your very breath has turned to ice just past your lips. Some kind of malevolent power has disrupted time and space.|
24386|Andre: "Out of my way! No one leaves here alive!"|
24387|Andre: "This... this power! The ritual! It's begun!"|
24388|Andre: "I'll not allow the powers of evil to prevail!"|
24389|Von breathes in deeply, the air around you whistling and howling as he attempts to transform himself once more.|
24390|You glance around. Security looks tight. Dark Skeletal Hounds patrol the four corners of the area.|
24391|The Undead Warriors seem weaker here than in the west, making it an ideal spot for an attack. |
24392|Head back and fill Odum in on the results of your surveillance.|
24393|These are the outskirts of the Undead Legion Camp. The attack should originate here.|
24394|Defeat the Undead Warriors to create chaos!|
24395|Watch out!!|
24396|Victoria and Maggie arrive.|
24397|I will await your arrival with bated breath... if you survive, that is!|
24398|The guard seems to be distracted. He hasn't noticed your smoke bomb.|
24399|Each and every one of those vile boars is now sleeping like a baby. Mission accomplished.|
24400|Von: "You troublesome peons! Behold the power of a true dragon!"|
24401|Von absorbs the ice particles hanging in the air and mutates into an enormous dragon of ice.|
24402|The Shadow Knight begins casting a spell to repair the surrounding Crimson Magic Squares.|
24403|It gives a little sniff, ponders the smell for a moment, then falls asleep with a clunk.|
24404|The portal is finally destroyed.|
24405|Snow Mountain was successfully scouted!|
24406|The monsters! THE MONSTERS!|
24407|Quickly, follow me!|
24408|Andre leaves for the far reaches of Frozenlea in search of the Shadow Knight.|
24409|Andre can only gape in horror as the resurrection ritual begins right before his very eyes.|
24410|Once you enter the cave, the temperature plummets.|
24411|With each step, the depths of the Frozenlea Plains grow unbearably colder.|
24412|With a brilliant flash, Von transforms himself into a block of ice and disappears.|
24413|Could this battle spell the end of everything as we know it?|
24414|The Shadow Knight! He was behind everything all along... What kind of dastardly plan does he have up that infernal sleeve of his?|
24415|Guzigla focuses his energy in order to summon his Abyssal Instrument.|
24416|Odum interrupts the fighting to inquire about your condition. |
24417|The Shadow Knight destroys the Crimson Magic Square, ravaging the lands of the Frozenlea Plains, before disappearing.|
24418|Don't leave yet! Wait to make sure the boars fall asleep. |
24419|A beam of rich, golden light streaks across the sky, and the treasure appears before you.|
24420|Kusanagi: "Now, now, now! Not so fast!"|
24421|Kusanagi suddenly emerges from the light with a brilliant, rainbow flash.|
24422|Kusanagi: "Let's not take what isn't ours!"|
24423|Kusanagi: "Or do I need to teach you the hard way?!"|
24424|You notice a treasure chest where the Shadow Knight had been standing...|
30296|Evade the Werewolf Tribe Guards on your way to the tablet. When you arrive, use the Enchanted Memory Sphere on the tablet.|
30297|The Werewolves begin to gather, but Palo seizes the moment to charge into the Abandoned Cult Village.|
30298|Evade the Werewolf Tribe Guards and proceed to the innermost tablet.|
30299|Werewolf Tribe Guard: "Who's there?!" (You've been spotted! The guards are now searching for you.)|
30300|The newly arrived guard seems to have something important to report.|
30301|You've been discovered by the Werewolf Tribe Guards! Find a hiding place.|
30302|Things have calmed down outside. Take this opportunity to locate the tablet.|
30304|Suddenly, Stone Tablet Sentinels surround the tablet. |
30305|It's an ambush! Time to fight...|
30306|As planned, you start a commotion in the Abandoned Cult Village.|
30307|Defeat the Werewolf King and foil the Shadow Knight's plans!|
30308|Where the tablet once stood, there are now only the scars of battle and the corpses of fallen Stone Tablet Sentinels. |
30311|Watch out! The closer you get to the tablet, the tighter Werewolf security will be.|
30313|Mia: "Mission accomplished! Let's rendezvous with the Eldest Prince and the others."|
30318|Security is extremely tight here. The tablet must be somewhere up ahead.|
30320|Defeat the Werewolf King's guards!|
30321|Another pack of werewolves! Defeat them!|
30322|Werewolf King: "You blithering idiots... I'll tear the sinews from your flesh!"|
30323|The Werewolf King has arrived with his guards, and he's chomping at the bit to get his claws on you.|
30324|With the their king destroyed, the werewolves scatter like scared puppies.|
30325|The Werewolf King is casting a spell! You can't move a muscle!|
30326|The Werewolf King has cast a spell on the area. Everyone is affected!|
30327|The Werewolf King has cast a spell on the area. Everyone is affected!|
30328|"Die, you filthy creature!" Just as Mia finishes talking, the Werewolf King begins to radiate a brilliant, white light.|
30329|The Werewolf King utters a few final words, then lies still. |
30330|The Enchanted Memory Sphere shines brightly as the inscription is completed.|
30331|The Werewolf Guards seem restless. Quickly, find a hiding place!|
30332|The Werewolf Guards have left the tablet unguarded. Something outside seems to be drawing their attention.|
30333|This is your chance to reach the tablet!|
30334|Yes, sir! (The guards are so frightened, they begin to leave the village.)|
30335|Did... Did someone get past us?|
30336|Or am I just being paranoid?|
30337|No one gets past us!|
30338|All hail the king!|
30339|The poison takes hold of Palo, sapping away his strength and decreasing his body mass.|
30340|Luckily, due to his smaller size, he's able to avoid being detected by the Werewolves.|
30341|The Werewolves are distracted by the commotion from outside. Quickly, get to the tablet!|
30342|The Werewolves walk right past you - hiding behind the bushes seems to have worked.|
30343|The Werewolf Guards are frantically repeating the Werewolf King's orders...|
30344|Looks like everything is going smoothly on the other side.|
30345|Demon beasts are coming through the portal and laying waste to the land.|
30346|You and Erika proceed deep into the Beastbone Plains to attempt to destroy the gate.|
30347|When you're ready, talk to Erika about destroying the portal.|
30348|The portal is just ahead. When you're ready, proceed to speak with Erika.|
30349|Locate the portal and destroy it before a stronger demon beast emerges!|
30350|You found the portal!|
30351|Erika casts a spell on the Enchanted Energy Sphere, creating a Magic Circle of flames.|
30352|The Fire Spirit summoned by Erika bestows its powers upon you.|
30353|Warning! If you leave the Magic Circle, you will lose this power.|
30354|Erika: "Casting this spell will take some time. You'll have to protect me!"|
30355|Erika: "The energy accumulation has gone smoothly so far. Keep me safe - we can't let anyone interrupt the ritual!"|
30356|Erika: "I can feel the Fire Spirit power growing. I just need a little more time..."|
30357|Erika: "Just a little more..."|
30358|Erika: "These wretched Demon Beasts interrupted the ritual! I have to start over..."|
30359|Erika: "Okay, we've accumulated enough energy. Keep a lookout for me."|
30360|A massive fire engulfs the portal, reducing it to ashes!|
30361|You hear Erika's voice as you slowly lose consciousness...|
30362|Suddenly, you hear a mysterious voice.|
30363|"Open your eyes."|
30364|"The Shadow Knight? Where am I..." Is this real, or just an illusion?|
30365|"Stop him!"|
30366|The unknown voice fades away, and your vision blurs again...|
30367|You can feel your consciousness slipping away...|
30368|The portal is destroyed!|
30369|Seeing that the portal is about to be sealed off, demon beasts begin to leap through it.|
30370|Erika: "Excellent! The Energy Spheres are ablaze with flame. Now, the next attack has to be prepared a bit more carefully."|
30371|Another wave of demon beasts! Soon they'll emerge from the portal!|
30372|A horde of demon beasts is attacking!|
30373|The Sealing Spell is ready. A powerful blast of light instantly annihilates the demon beasts!|
30374|A fierce beam of light descends from the portal.|
30375|The portal closes thanks to the Fire Spirit's attack.|
30376|You feel giddy with excitement... but Erika realizes that something is amiss.|
30377|You see the Shadow Knight, placing a flower upon the Icebound Sarcophagus.|
30378|A mysterious woman turns toward you. It seems as though she wants to say something...|
30379|An aura of relentless evil is flooding out the portal. Talk to Erika.|
30380|A mysterious, evil aura seems to hover just inside this portal...|
30381|The earth trembles violently, and the Fire Spirit appears!|
30382|Overwhelmed by the Fire Spirit's power, the demon beasts are instantly turned to ashes!|
30383|Remain within the Magic Circle to acquire skills. Press 1 and 2 to use these skills to defeat the demon beasts!|
30385|To fight the demon protection shield, you must collect the weapons from the Artillery Tower.|
33043|This place seems to have a very high energy density.|
33044|A lady dressed in white stands silently before the tablet. What is she doing?|
33045|In the depths of the Mineral Lake, the energy's density grows even greater.|
33046|Suddenly, you feel the energy rushing towards you, and it makes you feel giddy.|
33047|Your vision blurs, and you begin to lose consciousness.|
33048|When you come to, you have no idea where you are.|
33049|Looking around in panic, you see a lady dressed all in white.|
33050|She walks slowly towards the tablet.|
33051|Then, turning towards you, she bows.|
33052|Confused, you call out to her, but realize that you have no voice.|
33053|Your vision blurs once again.|
33054|As it returns, you realize that you are still at the Lake.|
33055|It is as if everything you saw just a moment ago had never happened.|
33056|At this point, you are no longer sure what's real and what isn't.|
33057|You decide the best thing to do is to find Cambel and tell her about all of it.|
33058|This is the Mineral Lake zone. You stop for a while to take in the surroundings.|
34179|There seem to be loud noises up ahead. Go investigate.|
34180|The Winged Duke is gone, and the power that controls the Magic Circle begins to dissipate.|
34181|The Winged Duke voraciously absorbs the life energy from the soldiers.|
34182|The power raging all around gives Odum a burst of strength, and he manages to break free of his bonds.|
34183|Help Odum save the others!|
34184|Enraged that things are not going as planned, the Winged Duke casts a spell and quickly leaves.|
34185|The path ahead is blocked by fire. Looks like you'll need to get around it somehow...|
34186|Let me help you, Odum.|
34187|Odum gives you the Divine Power. Use it to save the others...|
34188|The troops have suffered serious casualties, and you and Odum decide to return the injured soldiers to base.
You must wait for a better time to continue pursuing the Winged Duke.|
34189|Thank you for saving me.|
34190|Ow! My head still hurts.|
34191|I'll never forgive what the Winged Duke has done!|
34192|Why... why does it feel like the ground is shaking...?|
34193|I don't feel well.|
34194|You have saved three soldiers. Go and save the rest!|
34195|There aren't many captured soldiers left. Go and save them!|
34196|You saved all the soldiers!|
34197|Upon learning that his plans were sabotaged and all the captured soldiers were saved, the Winged Duke became furious.|
34198|Odum: I shall give you the power to save them!|
34199|You arrived just in time! Thanks to you, the Winged Duke's plan was foiled.
Odum is deeply grateful for your efforts.|
34200|The Winged Duke... how dare he do this to my people!|
34201|Caresha is worried that Odum can't defeat the Winged Duke alone. She asks you to help him on the front lines.|
35031|You are now deep inside the forest. The surroundings are incredibly beautiful.|
35032|Join Fenrich in the investigation and try to find out if the magnetic anomaly is originating from the Icebound Sarcophagus.|
35033|Surprised, you try to think back to the illusion from earlier. Could you have missed anything? You are deep in thought, when...|
35034|The Frozen Sorcerer casts a vicious spell, and a blast of cold air traps everyone where they stand.|
35035|You feel yourself growing colder and colder, until you begin to go numb.|
35036|Then, at the last moment, you feel the Power of Gaia flowing through your veins. You are revitalized!|
35037|The Power of Gaia vibrates around you, creating a powerful magnetic field.|
35038|As it expands, you pull Fenrich out of the danger zone.|
35039|Gaia's Magnetic Field grows even larger as you pour more Power of Gaia into it.|
35040|Then, you are hit with an Ice Energy spell, and the Magnetic Field contracts.|
35041|Your Gaia's Magnetic Field approaches maximum force - it is nearly ready to break through the Frostbite Energy!|
35042|The field's energy has reached its limit. Use the energy to destroy the Frost Spell!|
35043|Use Gaia's Ascendancy 5 times in a row to strengthen and expand Gaia's Magnetic Field.|
35044|If you do not use Gaia's Ascendancy for 25 seconds or more, the Frostbite Energy will shrink your Gaia's Magnetic Field.|
35045|The Frozen Sorcerer is finally gone. You and Fenrich begin to make your way out of the forest.|
35046|Use Gaia's Ascendancy to counter the Frozen Sorcerer's frost spell attack.|
35047|A bright light suddenly whizzes past, and the Frozen Sorcerer appears in front of you.|
35048|The weather turns cold again, and a freezing gust of air breezes past you.|
35049|Just as the battle is about to start, a witch suddenly appears nearby.|
35050|The situation is very tense... aside from the cold, there's something mysterious in the air that no words can describe.|
35051|At last, you and Fenrich are ready to venture into the Ice Crystal Forest to find the reason behind the magnetic anomaly.|
35052|As you return to the teleporter, you ask about the latest developments regarding the magnetic interference.|
59781|Time to rock out!|
59782|Sing it like there's no tomorrow!|
59783|Let Cesela protect Master!|
59784|How dare you try to bully Cesela!|
59785|This is the celestial power!|
59786|Hear my song! Let it lead you in the fight!|
59787|Kneel before my crown of light!|
59788|Coming! Master, is it you who called?|

326|Auctioning
Head to the Auction House to find just what you need for your journey, or sell items you don't need to interested buyers!

Buying
After clicking on an item you want, press "Purchase" to pay for it and complete the transaction.

Selling
For each item sold, 10% will be deducted from your profits as the listing fee. All currently-auctioned items are displayed at the bottom-left.

Setting the Auction
Drag the item that you'd like to sell to the Auction column, enter the selling price, select a store to join, and pay the listing fee to complete the process. Items will be displayed for 24 hours - if the item is not sold during this time, it will be de-listed and returned to you via mail.

Compare Prices
When you click on an item and select "Start Price Compare," all of that item currently listed in the Auction House will be displayed in the right-hand column, along with their prices.

Canceling an Auction
If an item you have listed hasn't yet sold, you can select it at any time and click "Cancel Auction" to de-list the item, which will be returned to you via mail. Canceling an auction will not refund the item's listing fee.|
327|Anti-Bot Test
From time to time, you may see a window pop up giving you three tries to enter a code. When the code is successfully entered, you will gain a helpful 10-minute buff that increases your EXP by 10% and restores your spiritual power. However, if you fail to enter the code correctly, you'll receive a 10-minute debuff that reduces your HP to 1% and sends you back to your most recent Waypoint.|

When your character's HP reaches 0, they will die. Not to worry, though - there are three ways to bring them back to fight another day!

Local Revival: Revive at the starting Waypoint of the area, out of harm's way.

Waypoint Revival: Revive at the Waypoint you most recently set.

On-the-Spot Revival: If you have a reviving item in your inventory, you can come back right on the spot where you died.

Tip: Talk with the Shield of Virtue medical officers stationed across the land to record new revival points.|

4042|First on the battlefield and the last to leave, Guardians work tirelessly to ensure victory through superior tactics. Their sword and shield combo gives them a balanced offense and defense, enabling them to outlast enemies while waiting for the perfect opening - or to create one with a well-timed block and counterattack.|
4043|Consummate masters of support, Bards know a song for every situation. Always a hit in parties, their sonic skills are enough to see them through a solo performance. With harp in hand, they can unleash songs to harm, heal, or help, ensuring they'll always be called on for an encore.|
4044|The ways of magic are mysterious to many, but Wizards see order amidst the chaos, looking to the forces of nature for their inspiration. Using staves to focus raw mana, they conjure elemental spells that can turn the tides of battle, making them respected and indispensable allies in combat.|
4045|Each swing of a Ravager's massive axe delivers a payload of pain, and often collateral damage to any unfortunate enough to be standing too close. With fury burning in their eyes, they will shrug off their own injuries and destroy anything that stands in their way.|

These miraculous feats of engineering are capable of firing missiles, discharging powerful plasma bursts, or launching elementally-charged grenades.

5476|Dear Envoy of Gaia,

Since now you've grown a bit and are ready to create your own party, it's time to find some partners and share adventure together! You can choose a Guild you like, join them and enjoy the experience. You may also use a Portal to be teleported to Navea to talk to Babama, and ask him how to build up your own Guild and recruit new members.|
5477|Dear Envoy of Gaia,

You've grown greater now, and understand how to call upon the Power of Gaia. When you can't fight enemies on your own, you can use the Team Up Interface to fight alongside a group of other Envoys of Gaia.

Or, you may use a Portal to be teleported to the Stall Area in Navea to Set Up a Stall so you can trade with other Envoys of Gaia and strengthen yourself with better weapons.|
5478|Dear Envoy of Gaia,

You are now an experienced adventurer. Keep up the pace, and explore this unknown world. When you reach Level 40, you will select and learn how to use a second weapon. You will be able to use the Refining system to enhance your own Weapons and Armor.|

5611|Brawlers live for the thrill of close-range combat, their wrist-mounted blades turning their arms into deadly weapons. With superhuman reactivity, they pile on heavy combos to lock down enemies. Darting and weaving in and out of the fight, Brawlers will carve up any foe who can't keep up blow for blow.|
5612|Preferring ancient elegance to the latest technology, Rangers turn to the bow, a noble, time-tested weapon as deadly as it was in ages past. With their long-range assaults, Rangers can drop many foes before they get a chance to attack. The arrows they fire are not only as damaging as any blade, but a fine vehicle for enchantments as well.|
5613|After the flash of the blade, all that remains are cherry blossoms in the air and slain enemies on the ground.

A Ronin uses unparalleled blade skills and intense observation to destroy enemies in a flash by striking their weaknesses.
The unique skill of the Ronin drains the souls of enemies and collects them in the blade. Souls stored in the Tachi can be released in battle, destroying all that stands in their way.

5614|The grim reaper of the underworld has appeared. Wherever he goes, death follows.

He who wields the scythe marshals unrivaled destructive power and ferocious attack speed. When the blade falls, heads will roll.
He signs contracts with minor devils, and summons them in battle. He is also versed in various kinds of powerful magic, which he uses to inflict heavy damage on the enemy.|

20024|You have to show the treasure to all the guards you meet, in order to meet the Pirate Adjutant.|
20025|You show all the treasure and send them to the seashore for more.|
20026|The pirate looked at it, reminding you to show it to the outpost guard.|
20027|The Outpost Guard is ahead on the right side; show him the treasure.|
20028|The Pirate Corsair is walking towards you.|
20029|Stop!|
20030|I must show him this treasure if I am to pass.|
20031|When you finally meet the Pirate Adjutant, show him the treasure to complete the quest.|
20032|Please continue to show the treasure to the other guards.|
20033|You showed the treasure to all the guards. Now you can show it to the Pirate Adjutant.|
20034|The Guard looks at you, picks up a piece up and looks at it closely.|
20035|The guard saw your "treasure" from a distance, and kept staring at it.|
20036|Faint cries seem to come from the guard ahead.|
20037|The Guard gave a casual look and yawned.|
20038|You saw a few bats flying to your side and starting to attack the Wolfmen.|
20039|More bats fly to your vicinity, and attack Wolfmen whenever they see them.|
20040|The bats hover near the camp fire, looking a bit frenzied.|
20041|You show Adjutant Bluto the treasure from the cart.|
20042|Now that they're distracted, I have to get out of here as quickly as I can.|
20043|No! Don't you come near me!!!|
20044|My dear, don't be shy! We gotta face up to ourselves!|
20045|The point is the woman I love is... Your sister!|
20046|What? I don't have any sisters, only a brother!|
20047|You can't just barge in here! Get out!|
20048|You can't come upstairs. If you know what's good for you, you'll get out of here right now!|
20049|Give me your treasure!|
20050|With this much money, I don't have to be a pirate anymore! I can retire in comfort!|
20051|How dare you poach treasure in another pirate's territory? You're begging for death!|
20052|Treasure! I want real treasure!|
20053|You haven't picked up the Stolen Ceremonial Tome. Do you have enough space in your backpack?|
20054|Those corpses... They're dead guards. It looks like Brian was here.|
20055|No! You're also here to save this little devil, so you'll come to a sorry end like them!|
20056|After the gatekeeper fell, an entrance opened up in front of the hall's demon sculpture, leading deep within.|
20057|The scenery here is even stranger, as the deep part of this Great Land has been ruined.|
20058|Come ride on my Ostrich Cart, I'll show you the famous attractions of Navea!|
20059|You hear the sounds of footsteps, accompanied by the voices of the Village Chief and his wife.|
20060|Joel!|
20061|Suddenly, an immense pressure fell over the place, too strong to ignore.|
20062|The Shadow Knight's voice echoes throughout the hall.|
20063|Shadow Knight: "It's time to end this farce!"|
20064|Fire sprayed from the Shadow Knight's sword, killing everyone nearby.|
20065|Andre will stop these Demon Spiderlings. Go on to the next Commander.|
20066|Such strength! I never stood a chance.|

20089|What happened?|
20090|Competition begins! Alain shouted.|
20091|This competition was really worth watching! The winner is Augustus Mk. VII!|
20092|Coming up next is an absolutely thrilling match for everyone. Let's welcome the Rock Warrior!|
20093|I'm so dizzy...|
20094|Northeast of Timbria Forest|
20095|How could it have come to this...|
20096|The competition is getting really exciting. Let's go on to the next one!|
20097|Ladies and Gentlemen, coming up next is Iron Dragon! His opponent better look out, Iron Dragon is well-known for piling attack on attack!|
20098|Will I become like him, in the end?|
20099|Let's map this place first...|
20100|Almost done mapping the rough terrain around Catseye Lair...|
20101|Finally finished drawing the map. Now let's take it back to Luther.|
20102|Cough... I declare Augustus Mk. VII qualified for final match!|
20103|Alright! Here comes the moment, let's have a round of applause for all our competitors.|
20104|The whole audience kept cheering for Montero.|
20105|Selena can't be here... All I see are pirates!|
20106|As I am the Brevis Chief as well as the organizer of the competition, I declare the final match starts... now!|
20107|This is really an unbelievable competition. It seems...|
20108|Uh... Well, looks like this game is already over. This time the winner is Augustus...|
20109|Don't push!|
20110|The elders of a family are precious, their wisdom and experience is a treasure. Please treat them with more respect.|
20111|After putting down the large urn, you quickly hid yourself to one side.|
20112|A trio of patrolmen pass by.|
20113|Hmm? How come there's a large urn here?|
20114|Tribal Patrolmen try to push the urn away.|
20115|Feels quite heavy. Don't know what's inside it.|
20116|I got it! This must be the wine that someone stole from Lunarin Village!|
20117|Great! With this much wine, we can hold ceremonies for several days!|
20118|Let's move this urn to the warehouse quickly!|
20119|Three Tribal Patrolmen lifted the urn up, and carried it to the inside of their camp.|
20120|Great, Thanks a lot.|
20121|Now that all the Ceremonial Vessels have been found, we should get out of here quickly.|
20122|Robot Guards have found you! They immediately raise the alarm!|
20123|Glowing Robot: WARNING! WARNING! Invasion of unidentified object!|
20124|Oops! I'm caught. I have to find shelter first.|
20125|North of the Farm|
20126|You will enter into the Witch's memory, and experience her past just as she did.|
20127|In her memories, you see that the Witch cast "Summon Meteor"(a powerful range attack) and "Earth Frost" (a straight-line Immobilized attack) most often.|
20128|Several enemies have appeared, and they're closing in. Quickly, repel them with magic!|
20129|Enough! All of you, get out!|
20130|Things suddenly went dark. You don't know what happened.|
20131|You heard a faint conversation.|
20132|Darkness again...|
20133|This time you are not surprised, and silently observe the change in your surroundings.|
20134|Hazel's voice rang out, but not from the witch in front of you.|
20135|Hazel: "Ok... You've seen enough. Now go back."|
20136|You can already guess what will happen.|
20137|Again... complete darkness...|
20138|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Great, see if there are other Wolfman Marks around.|

20148|The ceremony is about to begin. The crowd begins to move closer to the altar.|
20149|Before the ceremony starts, we must first thank this hero.|
20150|Thanks to this Envoy's help, the preparations for the ceremony went smoothly this year.|
20151|Applause breaks out all around.|
20152|Please place the Crescent Gems on the altar.|
20153|Once you put the gems on it, the altar starts to emit brilliant lights.|
20154|Villagers standing around begin to sing and dance excitedly.|
20155|The village chief then takes a box from under the altar.|
20156|This is the key that has been passed down from one generation to the next in the village. Now I will use this key to open the Starlight Treasure Chest.|
20157|You enjoy the ceremony first, and look for me in the village afterwards.|
20158|After saying that, the Village Chief takes the box and walks back to the village.|
20159|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Follow my command, move forward to the red arrow.|
20160|I didn't expect pirates patrolling the shore... Looks like things won't be that easy...|
20161|Must figure out how to avoid these parrots...|
20162|This is the planned site for the southern section trap. Great, set it up quickly.|
20163|Here's the middle section...  Pirates are patrolling here... Gotta keep my voice down.|

20177|After you have piled Aquatic Plants up on the ground, a huge turtle approached from a distance.|
20178|When you opened the bag filled with bats, they poured out and flew quickly toward the camp.|
20179|After using the scanner, the machine produced a page of numbers.|
20180|We have gained a powerful force from the spring water. You, frail human, cannot defeat us!|
20181|When you arrive at the designated location, soldiers begin to gather.|
20182|Is everyone ready? Let's show these Sarpa who's boss!|
20183|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Quick! Attack these Wolfmen!|
20184|Mia's command rang out in your mind: You've completed the mission, now head for the campfire!|
20185|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Keep patrolling, There are many targets still to be eliminated.|

20199|Set a trap in the northern section.|
20200|Eastern side of Demarech Mines|
20201|Western side of Demarech Mines|
20202|Southern Path Entrance|
20203|Southern Path Depths|
20204|Lead troops against the Sarpa|
20205|Equip divine weapons|
20206|Use Summon from the Shortcut List to summon Eidolons|
20207|Drink Refreshing Potion|
20208|Good, the trap here is completely set up. Let's go to the next place!|
20209|Skandia|
20210|Statue Ruins|
20211|Timbria Forest|
20212|Hushglen Hollow|
20213|Logging Site|
20214|Hidden Cave|
20215|What kind of situation is this?|
20216|Well... Are you being too happy or...?|
20217|Wow! Are you okay? What happened?|
20218|Hmm? A wood pile ashore. It might be useful.|
20219|Ah... They've seen us. Let's retreat to a safe place. Staying alive is the most important task.|
20220|Vhell says, "Outsiders, leave immediately or pay the price!"|
20221|Vhell says, "Since you wanted in so badly, I won't let you out..."|
20222|Under the blockade of East City Ruins, you have to use "East City Mountain Pass Teleporter" beside "Collector Akers" to enter or exit there.|
20223|You have knocked out the Double Leaf Sprout. Quickly, put it in your cloth bag!|
20224|Altar of the Moon|
20225|East of Navea|
20226|Outside the Alabastren Temple|
20227|Center of New Moon Hunting Grounds|
20228|North of New Moon Hunting Grounds|
20229|You found a suspicious mound near the spot marked on the map. Do you want to dig it up?|
20230|There seems to be a commotion not far from here. Go take a look!|
20231|Bring the treasure chest from the Pit Beetle to Isaias to have it opened.|
20232|Isaias: I am quite sure there is a treasure map buried somewhere nearby. Come and help me dig it out!|
20233|Stone Hammer Tribe|
20234|Don't underestimate what these bugs can do. It is horrifying and devastating when they swarm.|
20235|Isaias: Let's put the torn pieces of the treasure map together and see where the treasure is buried.|
20236|I see more and more beetles. Gotta be careful.|
20237|Show Isaias the treasure map.|
20238|When you begin to search, a pirate suddenly jumps out!|
20239|Donny released his own beetle. The two beetles locked mandibles in a face-off.|
20240|Go for it, little boy! Show them what being a champion is all about!|
20241|Donny's beetle slowly moved forward.|
20242|Donny's beetle stopped moving. Looks like it's about to die.|
20243|You won this Beetle Battle.|
20244|My boy! You can't die! My boy!!|
20245|The sneaky villagers suddenly rush out from behind!|
20246|This... This feeling is...|
20247|A golden light shone from the alchemist's body.|
20248|Really delicious!!!|
20249|The witch, after muttering a spell, became shrouded in a black fog!|
20250|When you started the seismometer, the device made a buzzing.|
20251|The machine has finished its measurement. Now move on to the next place.|
20252|Measurement in all locations have been completed. Now, quickly, take the seismometer back to the Craftsman.|
20253|Ralph picked up the trumpet shell and blew it, hard. The sound was very loud.|
20254|Children appeared, obviously attracted by the sound of the trumpet shell.|
20255|Who blew the trumpet shell?|
20256|What happened?|
20257|Be quiet! I'm now the boss of the Helonia Pirates!|
20258|Can I blow the shell if I join?|
20259|Any yummy things to eat?|
20260|The very first thing we need to do is build our own pirate ship. You go to the shore and gather wood!|
20261|I still have other things to do. Gotta be going.|
20262|I'm so hungry. Need to go home and eat something.|
20263|After saying that, the kids left.|
20264|NO! Even if I am the only one here, I still can be the Pirate King! Right?|
20265|The hunter took the parrot out.|
20266|I think I'll name you... Bobby!|
20267|I'm talking about your name, not mine.|
20268|Stop talking! Shut up!|
20269|Perry is so fed up with the noisy parrot that he sets it free just to be rid of it.|
20270|Next time, I want a quieter pet.|
20271|I want to do this like it says in this book, as soon as possible.|
20272|First, apply the green juice sparingly on the face. Then put the feather in the hair...|
20273|Done! Let me see how it looks!|
20274|Why it looks like this! Don't tell me that this is the Gnome's makeup book!|
20275|Sue hurriedly removes the makeup from her face.|
20276|After saying that, Paolo starts assembling the components.|
20277|Done. It's a piece of cake to manufacture the Gnomes' stuff.|
20278|I have made some improvements. This robot is definitely more powerful than any the Gnomes have manufactured.|
20279|That's not my technical problem... The Gnome's materials are not good enough. Right! That's the reason!|
20280|The seed, once buried in soil, soon bloomed into a flower.|
20281|Unexpectedly... A brutal Beetle just appeared under the flower!|
20282|After you have used the slate, a translucent spirit appears in front of you.|
20283|When you see this message, I will be gone.|
20284|But remember that this temple has something really terrible sealed inside it.|
20285|No matter what happens, you have to protect this place. Don't let the seal be broken.|
20286|If you fail, a terrible calamity will be unleashed upon the land.|
20287|After saying that, the spirit slowly disappeared.|
20288|First make sure if this is the kind of thing it likes to eat.|
20289|The Birdbrain happily devoured the feed.|
20290|The Birdbrain continues to ask Clark for food.|
20291|You really eat a lot. This should be enough for you.|
20292|The Birdbrain ate the feed too quickly again.|
20293|No way! If you eat it all again, I'll lose money.|
20294|With nothing to eat around, the Birdbrain got angry and ran away.|
20295|Next time, I'll have to find an animal that doesn't eat this much...|
20296|Let's leave this village first. I must have lost my baby outside.|
20297|Last time I was outside the village, I went to the pool in the east. Let's go there and take a look around.|
20298|I can feel it. My baby must be around the pool in the south.|
20299|Suddenly a small Jerboa came out of a nearby crevice.|
20300|Great, my baby is safe!|
20301|Thank you for helping me find my baby. I'd like to give you this, in gratitude.|
20302|Gruff put down a small box on the ground.|
20303|I picked this up from the riverside. I have no idea how to use this. Please just take it.|
20304|You put the flower basket on the altar, and a sprite came out from behind the altar.|
20305|I'm the spirit of the forest. Thank you for your dedication. I will bless you for a good harvest this year.|
20306|Wait, wait, how come there's nothing to eat inside?|
20307|Darn it! You cannot send me off with only these flowers!|
20308|The inferno devoured bats, and blocked your sight...|
20309|Looks like something is moving inside the middle of the mound.|
20310|You feel something is happening to the Crystal Ore.|
20311|Furious, the Magical Oreling abandons its Crystal Ore disguise and stands up.|
20312|Bartley: Don't worry! I'm here to help you!|
20313|Something's going on out front. Go see what it's all about.|
20314|An old voice: Oh my... can somebody come and help me...|
20315|There's noise up front. Head up and see what's going on.|
20316|The sounds of intense fighting come from the front. Go see what happened.|
20317|A horrifying scream came from up front. Go and see what happened.|
20318|Be careful, flames are all around. Don't get burnt.|
20319|It seems someone has triggered the pirates' defense system. Pirate Defense Robots have appeared!|
20320|Watch out! It's a pirate ambush! Fight back and be careful.|
20321|Grass Kingdom's warriors have joined the battle!|
20322|When Guard GT-630 was destroyed, the rest of the pirates ran away.|
20323|Don't underestimate me, you fool! I'm a warrior from Grass Kingdom.|
20324|The warrior Zinnia attacked with savage strength! The pirates' underlings suffered terrible damage, and ran away.|
20325|The mechanical guard of Catseye was hit with intense electricity. Its shield doesn't work!|
20326|The mechanical guard of Catseye was destroyed! I can't stay here for too long, the alarm was triggered.|
20327|Seems like the Grassling needs a temporarily break... better just keep on going.|
20328|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Woodbeast|
20329|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Rock Warrior|
20330|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Iron Dragon|
20331|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Defending Champion Montero|
20332|Abel: Help! I don't want to die!|
20333|The sounds of intense fighting can be heard around the corner.|
20334|Yeshe: Ouch, I think I pulled my groin! Just...just go on ahead without me.|
20335|Rehia seems to need a good rest.|
20336|You see Zinnia up ahead, assaulted by the pirates.|
20337|Ahead should be the consignor. Confirm with her and see if she needs any help.|
20338|This big, ancient tree radiates a mysterious aura.|
20339|You seem to have blacked out after a strong electrical shock.|
20340|A resounding noise rises from the depths of the Cave (190,150), lingering for a few moments.|
20341|Dustin: Wait a minute. I would like to finish digging out this mine.|
20342|When you wake up, you feel that a mysterious power teleported you to the big tree.|
20343|South of the farm|
20344|West of the farm|
20345|Captured Mistwalker Chief|
20346|Sprayed pesticide around the farm.|
20347|Please follow Meira and complete all the quests needed to let her acquire the Flower Crown Blessed by Sprites.|
20348|The sounds of an argument can be heard from around the corner.|
20349|Now that I'm in here, I have to find the stolen Ceremonial Vessel.|
20350|Halton: Now that I'm in here, I have to find the stolen Ceremonial Vessel.|
20351|I can get to the center of the Settlement if I walk along the road.|
20352|Halton: I can get to the center of the Settlement if I walk along the road.|
20353|This Electroreceptor will help me find those Ceremonial Vessels.|
20354|Halton: This Electroreceptor will help me find those Ceremonial Vessels.|
20355|Gotta avoid the Robots otherwise we'll have to retreat temporarily.|
20356|Halton: Gotta avoid the Robots otherwise we'll have to retreat temporarily.|
20357|The Electroreceptor indicates that the Ceremonial Vessel is somewhere nearby.|
20358|Halton: The Electroreceptor indicates that the Ceremonial Vessel is somewhere nearby.|
20359|The Electroreceptor has stopped again. I have to search around it.|
20360|Halton: The Electroreceptor has stopped again. I have to search around it.|
20361|The Electroreceptor has stopped at the corner. Maybe that's where the Stolen Ceremonial Tome is located.|
20362|Halton: The Electroreceptor has stopped at the corner. Maybe that's where the Stolen Ceremonial Tome is located.|
20363|This feature guides the Electroreceptor towards the exit you set, just follow it.|
20364|Halton: This feature guides the Electroreceptor towards the exit you set, just follow it.|
20365|The Electroreceptor looks a bit unstable... Is it running out of power?|
20366|Halton: The Electroreceptor looks a bit unstable... Is it running out of power?|
20367|Ah... The power has run out. Thank you so much for today.|
20368|Halton: Ah...The power has run out. Thank you so much for today.|
20369|Connecting Electroreceptor...|
20370|Connection succeeded. It's about to teleport.|
20371|A strange laughing came out...|
20372|Palmgil Oasis|
20373|Cracked Sand Plain|
20374|Sand Owl Camp|
20375|Dune Outpost|
20376|Cactus Plateau|
20377|Ruins of Sand|
20378|Dwelling of Rex|
20379|Dwelling of Curly-Tailed Chameleon|
20380|Stronghold of Sand Owl Bandits|
20381|The Crystal Mine is filled with the smell of blood...|
20382|The ghosts of many miners manifest before you.|
20383|These miners... Don't tell me that they were all killed by John!|
20384|The area was thick with sadness.|
20385|You feel dizzy. It seems that there's a power drawing you.|
20386|You can tell from all the commotion that a dangerous enemy is nearby.|
20387|The Electroreceptor is still moving, but unable to teleport.|
20388|Great! All the Stolen Ceremonial Vessels were discovered. Now only the Stolen Ceremonial Tome is left to do.|
20389|The ghost miners started to attack you from all directions.|
20390|The Demon destroyed John's heart and soul, reborn completely.|
20391|Uh...ah!!!|
20392|John: Gosh! This...This brilliant light, could it be the legendary "Heart of the Demon?"|
20393|John: If I sold it under the table, I could...|
20394|Crrck! Crrck! Crrck! The constant sounds of digging in the mine almost drowned out the shaky cry...|
20395|Johnny shouts, "Ah!!!"|
20396|It seems that you haven't checked the previous batch of Crystal Ore.|
20397|This...This word... Anyways, let's move forward quickly.|
20398|The light of the Crystal Ore reveals the past.|
20399|Oh... You were almost captured. You should be more careful this time.|
20400|Johnny: John, take a look. This is my son, when he was one month old. He looks really like me!|
20401|Johnny: After he grows up, he will become a... Wait, what are you doing...|
20402|Josey: Oh, John, look at this. Isn't this shining, brilliant crystal diamond ring beautiful?|
20403|Josey: This used up all the money that I've secretly stashed away over the years. It wasn't easy, but I finally managed to buy this!|
20404|Josey: Haha, how happy do you think my woman will be if I sent it to her? huh! You! Ahhhh!!!|
20405|It seems that happy promise is still ringing in your memory...|
20406|The blood stains are still on the ground.|
20407|Who? Who is there?|
20408|Go ambush the dozing Guard on the right, then change into his clothes and get past the next checkpoint!|
20409|The low growls of wild wolves can be heard ahead. Be careful, don't let yourself be seen!|
20410|Not sure where that midget is, he just passed here a while ago!|
20411|Ouch... Who hit me... Uhhh....|
20412|Sorry. I'm just gonna borrow your clothes for a while!|
20413|John: Wait for me... I'm sure I'll have enough money to have you cured...|
20414|John: This time there will surely be enough money...|
20415|John: After that, we'll be able to live happily.|
20416|Heart of the Demon - a gem formed in the corpse of a fallen Demon, possessed of an unmatched brilliance, at least according to legend.|
20417|Its beauty conceals the fact that its owner will be cursed. Its price is incredibly high.|
20418|John: After you are healed... We'll live happily ever after...|
20419|Bandage the injured Hunter|
20420|Your crops are suffering pest damage.|
20421|Explore the crystal mine step by step.|
20422|Push the cart to Akara.|
20423|The Stolen Ceremonial Tome is found. However, I still need to find the complete set of Ceremonial Vessels.|
20424|I found the stolen Tome and Vessels. Now I can go meet the foreman.|
20425|Kakkan's screaming made you feel there's no way to get in there and pick up Flower of Life.|
20426|First, you need to find a way to knock him out.|
20427|Ida quickly opened the letter and read it.|
20428|Will Caine come back and marry me, once the quest is over?|
20429|Gosh! Mei's boyfriend said those words, last time, but he never came back!|
20430|I have to go to church and pray for his safety as soon as possible.|
20431|Elena put the materials into the pot, and muttered the spell.|
20432|Dear Sprite of the Land, 
Please send your blessing to this warrior,
Keep him safe in this invasion of demons.|
20433|After Elena finished the ritual, you felt some special power surrounding you.|
20434|OK, so you are now under the fairy's protection. It will reduce the damage caused by monsters near you.|
20435|Millia took a carrot out to feed Bunnyhop.|
20436|The Bunnyhop excitedly bounced around Millia.|
20437|You came here to fish too?|
20438|Hey boy, don't think of fishing as something simple.|
20439|Without skill and patience, you won't catch anything all day.|
20440|See, a fish has hooked.|
20441|I have practice. Kiddo, you still have a lot to learn.|
20442|That must be a big fish on the line, it's pulling so hard on the rod.|
20443|The angler pulled up strongly on the rod, drawing a crab out of the water!|
20444|I got nipped! Help me get this crab off! Hurry up!|
20445|Thank you... It was just an accident. Next time I will definitely show you how to catch a big fish.|
20446|This magic can promote biological growth. It can make this sunbird bigger.|
20447|Dalala... Falala... Mimimimi...!|
20448|Flower made weird motions, muttering a spell that you couldn't understand.|
20449|Smoke comes out from the Sunbird's body. Once the smoke dispersed, a bird egg showed up on the ground.|
20450|Mmm... How did it get turned around, was there something wrong with my gestures?|
20451|I have to come up with some new gestures...|
20452|Once Elena cast a spell on the crystal, it radiated a strange light.|
20453|And then, a demon appeared from the crystal!|
20454|I'm free at last! I will burn this world to ashes!|
20455|The demon cast a spell, but it only created a small flame.|
20456|Wait, wait... Why my body has become so small? I feel so weak!|
20457|The demon looked at you, and broke into cold sweat.|
20458|I'm sorry, it was just a joke. Please don't take it so seriously!|
20459|The demon disappeared quickly, and the crystal returned to its original shape.|
20460|The nearby Crystal Mine seems rather strange. Go investigate!|
20461|A little boy is in front. Go forward and see how you can help him.|
20462|Please defeat the Grudge Robot blocking the path.|
20463|Humans! You are not permitted to enter this cave...|
20464|Grudge Robot: Humans... appeared... everyone... kill...!|
20465|This crystal looks dangerous. Give it to me, I'll keep it safe.|
20466|What's so important that Akara has to have a meeting in such a complex manner?|
20467|Forget it... Let's take this opportunity to talk to him about the threats facing the Exploration.|
20468|After reassuring Omar a little, you immediately went back to the Dune Outpost with Tina.|
20469|You see lots of bats flying into the Camp Fire, one after another.|
20470|The boy is gravely injured. This escort operation has failed, please start again.|
20471|Seems that there's something that looks like a small animal in front...|
20472|Anything happening up front?|
20473|A very strange creature appeared ahead of you.|
20474|With a thud, powerful Goldie appeared!|
20475|To repay you, the Small Tanuki joined the boy's party!|
20476|Thankful, the Small Nymph joined the boy's party!|
20477|Small Guardian of the Flowers joined the boy's party, just to repay you!|
20478|Enemy reinforcements have arrived. Looks like there's no way to get into the ravine quietly.|
20479|You took an ax and started chopping. Soon, you had a bundle of wood.|
20480|The Tiny Bunnyhop is following behind you, quickly lead it to Milla at the entrance of the fishing village.|
20481|The Tiny Bunnyhop seems smell a cabbage near you. It looks at you with big, hopeful eyes.|
20482|After just one bite of the carrot, the Tiny Bunnyhop starts being affectionate with you and follows you.|
20483|The Lightning Brotherhood successfully occupied a base!|
20484|The Lightning Brotherhood lost a squad!|
20485|The leader of Lightning Brotherhood is here, personally, to fight it out!|
20486|The whole of the Lightning Brotherhood will launch a final Attack!|
20487|Hogan, elder of the Ham League, shows up to confront you, personally!|
20488|Suddenly, a wave of dizziness leaves you shaky. Everything around you slowly fades into endless darkness.|
20489|You feel you are now leaving a certain realm.|
20490|Hmm...I think it's better to pull this pirate into the bushes, otherwise, he'll be discovered!|
20491|Elena's magic teleported you back to Port Skandia.|
20492|People seem to be gathering in front. Go and see what happened.|
20493|A scream came from deep inside the altar. That's probably not a good sign.|
20494|Some villagers were attacked. Go and rescue them!|
20495|My child was trapped in a house on the east side. Please save my child!|
20496|A piercing scream sounded, somewhere up  front. Go and see what it is.|
20497|Hey, hey... Zinnia was taken away to the altar by a fallen fairy.|
20498|So many villagers are under attack. Go kill the monster!|
20499|Ah ah ah... I can't hold out... Please find Zinnia and rescue her.|
20500|My magic power ran out again... I swear, this usually doesn't happen to me! Anyways, please rescue Zinnia for me.|
20501|Zinnia is about to be sacrificed! Quickly, to the rescue!|
20502|Venomous Water Balls appear all around. Don't let them touch you!|
20503|Ah... This is just the beginning. One day, we will be back!|
20504|Huh. Looks like the bad guys have some stuff they're trying to hold on to!|
20505|Northern end of the Rebel Fort|
20506|Main gate of the Rebel Fort|
20507|The Energy is recharged, let's see how things went.|
20508|Bulkam Mk.III, activate!|
20509|Bulkam Mk.III activates, its main gear spinning.|
20510|Power upgrade begins... 50%... 60%....|
20511|Power breakthrough 100%...... 110%.....|
20512|Excellent, keep on upgrading the power!|
20513|Power breakthrough 150%...... 160%....|
20514|Excellent! The champion title shouldn't belong to anyone else but me!|
20515|Exceeding safe operating limits... Damage irreversible...|
20516|No! Bulkam Mk.III!|
20517|The body of the Giant Woodbeast starts to burn!|
20518|The Locate Function is faulty, activate the Follow Mode.|
20519|The  Robot on Patrol is starting to follow behind you; it seems that it needs you to lead it back to the Village.|
20520|Confirm returning to the Village and head to the Service Depot, thanking the strangers for their help.|
20521|The soothing water rushes over you.|
20522|You feel a strength welling up inside.|
20523|You feel that you've become stronger!|
20524|You carefully put the Purple Lotus into the bottle. Quickly, take it back to Posey.|
20525|It's completed! This is my newest invention - The Iron Gear!|
20526|As long as I wear it while competing in the Robot Competition, I will be the champion!|
20527|Stark put on the Iron Gear.|
20528|The Iron Gear didn't react at all.|
20529|So heavy...... I can't move......|
20530|After Darwin put on the Sarpa disguise, he looked exactly like a Sarpa. Which is more or less what you expected.|
20531|I guess I won't be exposed with this disguise... How does a Sarpa walk without legs?|
20532|Just a twist to the left, then a twist to the right...|
20533|Darwin walked, wobbly but rapidly, towards the Sarpa Community.|
20534|The Goat swallowed the apple in one gulp! Suddenly, it choked and died!|
20535|Seven Dwarves suddenly appeared.|
20536|Why did  you kill our Goat!?|
20537|You have to pay us the money that we used to buy this Goat!|
20538|The Goat suddenly coughed vehemently, and spit out a more or less whole apple.|
20539|Luckily, the Goat regained consciousness. It seems like it couldn't breathe when it choked on the apple.|
20540|......|
20541|What do we do now, Boss?|
20542|Luckily our Goat is fine. But don't you dare to feed it anything from now on!|
20543|After saying that, the Dwarves disappeared into the Forest again.|
20544|After you smeared nectar on the tree branches, fairies appeared, drawn by the scent of the nectar.|
20545|After the fairies finished all the nectar on the branches, they turned their heads to look at you. Hungrily.|
20546|The fairies smelled Nectar on you, and turned to attack!|
20547|You have found a mound at the spot marked on the map.|
20548|See if you can dig up the mound.|
20549|Edward started to build a new golem.|
20550|The new stone golem was assembled from the fragments of the old one.|
20551|Patrol near the camp!|
20552|The golem followed the command, and started the patrol.|
20553|The spring water radiated a ray of light. From the light, a fairy appeared.|
20554|Were you the one who just threw silver coins into the water?|
20555|Just tell me what you wish for, and maybe I'll grant you your wishes... Fat chance!|
20556|It's as if you humans have nothing better to do than to come here and throw rubbish into the pool; do you know how much trouble you've caused me?|
20557|The fairy threw a coin angrily at your face.|
20558|Don't throw any trash into the pool next time, understand?!|
20559|After saying that, the fairy disappeared back into the pool.|
20560|I've always wanted to train a Armored Lion myself. Let me try this.|
20561|Shake hands!|
20562|The Armored Lion raises its hand.|
20563|It's really effective, let me try something else.|
20564|Roar!|
20565|The Armored Lion roars loudly.|
20566|Looks like it's easier than I imagined. Let me make it a little more difficult.|
20567|Pretend to be dead!|
20568|The Armored Lion lays on the ground, motionless.|
20569|How amazing! It looks so convincing.|
20570|This Lion looks like it has great potential...Ok, you can get up.|
20571|The Armored Lion continues lying on the ground, motionless.|
20572|...Oh no... It really is dead.|
20573|You threw the Shining Stone at the Rock Beetle, and the Rock Beetle swallowed it in one gulp.|
20574|The Rock Beetle becomes bigger!|
20575|After the Scavenger Bird was hit by the slingshot, it attacked you rather angrily.|
20576|You put the Bird's egg next to the fire, and prepared to roast the egg.|
20577|The egg split suddenly, and a small Scavenger Bird popped out!|
20578|The small Scavenger Bird seems to think that you are its mother, and follows you closely.|
20579|The Slime was affected by the dirt-removing device, its body started to melt into a pool of clean water.|
20580|You splashed the wandering villager with a Water-Filled Bucket.|
20581|Aaaaaaah!|
20582|I've been chasing after a beauty for three days! Why did she suddenly disappear?|
20583|I won't give up - I must find her!|
20584|After saying that, the Wandering Villager went off in another direction again.|
20585|The giant's eyes were pierced by the needle. Reacting to the pain, he shut his eyes.|
20586|The trap is sprung! Bound by the trap, your prey cannot move. Quick, seize this opportunity!|
20587|As you scrub and clean the grail, a Chalice Demon suddenly appeared!|
20588|I finally got out of that dingy old grail!|
20589|First, give me your soul to pay the price!|
20590|Looks like there are a few frantic figures in front.|
20591|A cry for help rings out ahead, go and take a quick look.|
20592|The cry of a small boy comes from a small house on the eastern side! Quick, go and rescue him!|
20593|There are fighting sounds ahead, seems like the villagers are fighting against the decaying Sprites.|
20594|The are still many villagers trapped in the depths! Go rescue them.|
20595|There are piercing screams from the Altar. Could the children from Grass Kingdom be in trouble?|
20596|Ah hahaha! Live sacrificial offerings on our doorstep again! Come, let me corrupt you!|
20597|There is a lot of Venomous Water around here. Be careful, don't touch it, it will burn you.|
20598|Reid: Shiloh! It's over!|
20599|The captured rhino made some pitiful cries, calling out to nearby rhinos...|
20600|The surrounding rhinos slowly gather around after hearing the pitiful cries...|
20601|The furious rhinos charged towards the Oracle Camp, throwing the camp into a state of chaos.|
20602|A few villagers are talking in front, listen carefully to their conversation!|
20603|Toxic water has contaminated the area in front, we have to clear away the Rotten Flowertraps in order to clean it up.|
20604|Most of the contaminated toxic water at the Altar has vanished.|
20605|You call on the spirit of the Avians, and dress up according to the instructions in the ritual book.|
20606|You have successfully assumed the appearance of an Avian!|
20607|When the wild bull saw the red cloth, it charged angrily towards you!|
20608|Beer Goulash from the Stone Hammer Giants? I've been waiting for this for a long time! I'll eat it!|
20609|Marvin took up a piece of meat and swallowed it.|
20610|This taste is... a combination of sour beer and half-cooked beef. After two different flavors blended together, it produced a unique...|
20611|Ech.. It tastes horrible!|
20612|Marvin immediately spit out the meat.|
20613|Gump saw the can, and moved towards it excitedly.|
20614|Gump couldn't find the can, and returned to the Altar, jumping wildly about.|
20615|The penguins in the area, agitated by Gump's antics, began to move wildly as well!|
20616|Exedore: Wait for a moment, I want to clear away Gump's mess.|
20617|You whipped the Gnome captive, and questioned him regarding the whereabouts of the antidote.|
20618|You only know this little trick? I think you should get a stupid Makar here, perhaps I will be more afraid.|
20619|You pulled out the whip and again lashed the Gnome captive.|
20620|What do you think you are doing! Don't you dare mess with me again!|
20621|You pulled out the whip again and lashed the Gnome captive.|
20622|That's enough! If you hit me again with that thing, I will dig out your innards!|
20623|You ignored the Gnome's cursing, and lashed the Gnome captive again.|
20624|Sob sob... Please... I really don't know anything... Won't you please let me go?|
20625|You lashed the Gnome captive again, and insisted that he tells you the whereabouts of the antidote.|
20626|I only know that the boss has all the most valuable herbs, maybe he has the antidote that you need!|
20627|Please! That's all I know, really, please don't hit me anymore... Let me go please.|
20628|I'm sorry, why don't you just rest in the grass for awhile!|
20629|Dwarves just have short legs.|
20630|Hmm... Eh... That...|
20631|Let's, let's run before we talk!|
20632|Oh I'm so tired, I really want to take a rest after walking to and fro.|
20633|We will be able to change shifts and have someone else take over, after walking 35,821 steps!|
20634|With me around, no one should even try to sneak past here.|
20635|Heh heh! No one can get through my sword barrier!|
20636|Ohhhh, when will I be promoted so I don't have to do patrolling work anymore.|
20637|Don't mind that, maybe you will grow taller one day!|
20638|There seem to be sounds of a mechanism opening up in the depths of the cave.|
20639|A strong, eerie wind comes from the depths of the cave; it looks like some powerful monsters has appeared from within!|
20640|After you drink the potion, your chest feels extremely uncomfortable...|
20641|Strange changes occur on the sea's surface; the choppy waves become as calm as a lake...|
20642|The Water Gem starts shining brilliantly in your hands following that.|
20643|The trees fell silent, as if they were reacting to the Tree Gem.|
20644|The Tree Gem shines brilliantly in your hands following that.|
20645|The stone statue's magical aura is absorbed by the Magic Gem.|
20646|The Magic Gem now shines brilliantly in your hands.|
20647|You wake up and see Doctor Cal standing there, trying to talk to you.|
20648|Centurion Goliath has arrived. Quick, go defeat him!|
20649|Mummer the Lion's Roar Warlord is a highly capable Makar, use all your might to fight him!|
20650|Please don't underestimate the Second Prince's capability!|
20651|The strongest warrior, Eldest Prince Palo Ryan, is your toughest challenge!|
20652|You suddenly feel incredibly dizzy...|
20653|The scorching fire wrought havoc in the Rebel Fort, the supplies are all destroyed by the fire.|
20654|The lackeys guarding the entrance are down! Let's break in!|
20655|There are still other enemies ahead, let's continue on to rescue the Fairy!|
20656|Aah... I can feel a surge of strength...|
20657|Due to the side effects of the potion, the body of the Eldest Prince has... shrunk!|
20658|Gatekeeper of the Ozymand Temple - Imadal|
20659|The injured are recovering at the side. Despite their suffering, their fighting spirit is still high.|
20660|A broken city wall, a fire illuminating the sky; it looks like doomsday.|
20661|You are confused, you have no idea why you are here.|
20662|High Templar:  Andre is just ahead, go meet him quickly!|
20663|High Templar: Excellent, victory can't be too far away with you around!|
20664|High Templar: Justice wins!|
20665|Up ahead is the first Demon Commander, Sheal Corpsegrinder!|
20666|He is a powerful Demon General, defeat him!|
20667|You have defeated the first commander! Move forward with Andre's army!|
20668|The atmosphere here doesn't feel right...|
20669|That's enough! Don't you think of going anywhere!|
20670|Jasitra Demontongue is the second commander! Defeat him to move on!|
20671|Diabu Hellfire is just ahead of you, looking at you with contempt.|
20672|The Shadow Knight is right there! Accept your destiny and confront him!|
20673|Those two seem to be saying something... Go nearer and hear what they are saying.|
20674|The wild wolf ahead looks like it doesn't want to move.|
20675|Let's go back and see if there is a way.|
20676|Let's dash past the Wolf Guard while the pollen is still on us.|
20677|Seems like there's a guard calling you from the front right side, quick go find him!|
20678|Roar!!!|
20679|There's a flower with an unusual scent. Go and smear its pollen all over yourself.|
20680|You have a letter and a map, you should be able to find some traces of Mina.|
20681|Exedore: Go to the shining marker in front of Gump and put down the can.|
20682|You put down a can.|
20683|Exedore: Wait! Young man! You won't be able to lead Gump out if I don't give you the can!|
20684|Some fierce penguins have appeared, be careful!|
20685|Exedore: Continue moving to the next marker and put down the can.|
20686|Found it! The Treasure Room of the Pirates!|
20687|The bomb that the Pirate Leader threw will also injure himself.|
20688|Trick the Pirate Leader into going near the bomb that he has thrown, so you could destroy him!|
20689|Use this opportunity to sneak attack that Pirate!|
20690|Ooops...Looks like you just have to brave it out anyway!|
20691|The freed Game Bird made some sounds, which sound like gratitude to you.|
20692|The Magical Energy Detector emits a strong flashing light, and splits in mid-air.|
20693|A cage appeared. It seems that someone is inside. Quick, go open it and check!|
20694|A gigantic shadow appeared at the Sprite Altar ahead; it looks like it's the Demon himself! Quick, go release the Sprite and save her!|
20695|The person ahead should be the consignor. Quickly, go and talk to her.|
20696|The Demon Recruits are obstructing your path... Try to communicate with them; and if that doesn't work, get physical!|
20697|So much treasure here! Where did these pirates get this from?|
20698|Hmmm... Wait! These gold coins are actually gold-plated.|
20699|Surprisingly there is such a vain Pirate Boss, seems like Faya's treasure dreams...|
20700|Probe and find out the truth behind the Pirates' big secret treasure.|
20701|Be aware of the areas the guards are watching closely. Don't go into them.|
20702|It feels like... A surge of incredible power, trying to burst from your body.|
20703|After some work, you dug out some metal ore; quick, go pick it up!|
20704|Gotta tell Perry about the situation here, fast. Don't alert the enemy...|
20705|You put the drugged Pirate into the bag and carry him back to Perry.|
20706|You shout for Selena outside the cottage, in order to test your info.|
20707|Adjutant Follower: Who's making all that noise outside? Are you tired of living?|
20708|The Adjutant Follower stomped out. Seems Selena isn't in the cottage.|
20709|During the next quest, you will disguise yourself as Braeden to sneak onto the shore at night and place a trap there.|
20710|You have to avoid the area the Catseye Parrot's is watching in the process, otherwise you'll be forced to start over.|
20711|Three traps have been put into your Backpack. You must put them at the designated setup point.|
20712|A few Pirates are turning the cottage upside down...|
20713|You draw the building's location, then head towards the eastern side.|
20714|The map in your hands is also getting more and more complete...|
20715|The camp configuration map is completed... Bring it to Luther quickly.|
20716|You ask Mac to release Selena, or you'll have to rescue her.|
20717|Mac steps backwards slowly...his mannerisms becoming a little strange.|
20718|Mac, the Catseye Pirate Leader, made a run towards the west! Go after him!|
20719|The Catseye Pirate Leader is surrounded by guards , best you don't go near him too abruptly...|
20720|You left a unique mark on the Catseye Pirates' flag with a charcoal pencil.|
20721|You make a special mark on the Pirates' flag while they aren't looking.|
20722|Tanner Jones, Hunters' Team Leader, has arrived at the Stone Hammer Camp. He is about to negotiate with Chief Amon.|
20723|In a while, there will be many wild beasts coming towards here.|
20724|You have two skills that you can use.|
20725|The first one is "Filling the Ammo". You can only use the second skill - "Strafe" after using the first one.|
20726|The second, "Strafe," is the main attacking technique, and can fire bullets rapidly.|
20727|After filling up, you can open fire as much as you like within fifteen seconds.|
20728|If you run out of ammunition, just reload.|
20729|Get ready! The wild beasts will be here soon.|
20730|You have exhausted all ammo. Please reload.|
20731|In this round of the competition, you have to defend your position against the Chief of Stone Hammer.|
20732|Giants will come forth from three directions to attack your stronghold.|
20733|You are on the defending team, leading your Hunters to defend your position.|
20734|Your Hunters' Team will wait for your orders before launching an attack.|
20735|When you are ready to give orders, please walk to the column behind them and press "Open Fire".|
20736|If your stronghold is destroyed, please press "Reconstruct Stronghold" to repair your stronghold.|
20737|If, after the Giants have launched five waves of attack, you have at least two Defense structures left at every stronghold...|
20738|Then you would have won this round of competition.|
20739|The competition is about to begin, please get ready.|
20740|The first wave of attack begins!|
20741|The Giants are attacking from the center and the right side!|
20742|The Giants are attacking from the center and the left side!|
20743|The Giants are attacking from the left and right sides!|
20744|The Giants are attacking from three directions!|
20745|Tanner: Boys, open fire!|
20746|Tanner: No need to go easy on the bullets boys, fire!|
20747|Tanner: Pull the trigger, and fire!|
20748|You have successfully defended the stronghold, and won this round of the competition!|
20749|At this moment, Tanner, the Team Leader, looks sharply at Chief Amon.|
20750|Not long after, Isaac went to check the coast.|
20751|He really found the bodies of many Pirates - the plan worked.|
20752|Please defeat the Demon Recruit guarding the entrance.|
20753|Braeden has finished setting up the bombs.|
20754|He can begin to work on the next plan following that.|
20755|After the rhinos took a look at their moaning companion, they started to tap their front hooves incessantly and made deep, low sounds.|
20756|Halton: Mmm, all the stolen ceremonial vessels have been found, now we just have the Stolen Ceremonial Tome to worry about.|
20757|Halton: The Stolen Ceremonial Tome has been found, but I still need to find all the Ceremonial Vessels.|
20758|Halton: The Stolen Ceremonial Tome and all the Ceremonial Vessels have been found, we can go meet the Foreman now.|
20759|Excellent, the first Ceremonial Vessel is now in our hands.|
20760|Halton: Excellent, the first Ceremonial Vessel is in our hands.|
20761|This is the second Vessel; there are many others to look for¡K|
20762|Halton: This is the second Vessel; there are many others to look for¡K|
20763|Four Vessels have been found. It's going more smoothly than expected.|
20764|Halton: Four Vessels have been found. It's going more smoothly than expected.|
20765|The seventh Ceremonial Vessel! We only have the last one left to find.|
20766|Halton: The seventh Ceremonial Vessel! We only have the last one left to find.|
20767|Please clear off the enemies in front before continuing to move forward!|
20768|Confound it! Ambush! Looks like we have to clear them all off before we can continue to move forward.|
20769|Please wait till the Electroreceptor has reached a fixed point before trying again.|
20770|The Electroreceptor is at a fixed point. The teleport function is ready.|
20771|The Foreman will be waiting for me at the exit at the top right hand corner of the camp. I have to get there fast.|
20772|Halton: The Foreman will be waiting for me at the exit at the top right hand corner of the camp. I have to get there fast.|
20773|The body of the Shadow Knight turned into black fire and vanished.|
20774|The Hunters Group, led by Tanner Jones, and the Giants with Amon both went in the direction of the Hunting Ground.|
20775|Chief Amon decides to have a competition of reaction with Tanner.|
20776|The first round of the competition ends with a draw between both parties.|
20777|Therefore, the Giants and the Hunters' Team moved to a different location on the Hunting Ground.|
20778|Both parties prepare for the second round of the competition.|
20779|You left a mark on the Pirates' flag - they didn't seem to notice.|
20780|While you are waiting, go to talk to the residents and ask if there's anything you can help with.|
20781|The sprite is moving inside the sack; get it back to Halton quickly.|
20782|The Sprite flies around you affectionately. Bring it along with you, to look for the King of Magic Flowers.|
20783|When the smell of the Gland got to the King of the Flowertraps, he came out of the flower shrubs angrily.|
20784|The King of the Flowertraps is greatly affected, reducing its strength.|
20785|The Drunk Flower Beetle is in the Flower Field at the south of the Village. You can only deal with the King of the Flowertraps after getting the Gland from the beetle.|
20786|Halton hid in the large urn with agile moves. Quick, take him to the Mistwalker Tribe.|
20787|The Elder ran away in haste; resulting in an uproar among the Gnomes.|
20788|You found a letter on the floor, dropped by the Elder when he ran away.|
20789|Clark Farm is in the middle of the hills. Find the Church's Scholar there.|
20790|You filled the bucket with clear spring water, now bring it back to Rosie.|
20791|Rosie needs a bit more time. See if there's anything else you can do.|
20792|You sprayed the pesticide around so that no bugs would approach.|
20793|Rosie's work should be done by now. Go back and look for her.|
20794|Navea is in the north-east; you'll see the gates when you reach it.|
20795|Even though you don't know his motive, just do what he says for now.|
20796|Nothing has changed in the area; however, the gem on the altar is gone.|
20797|Guardians are wandering nearby; they attack anyone who gets near.|
20798|Alabastren Temple is full of Gnomes and Robots; no one knows why¡K|
20799|Right, looks like Anthony has also sent some people to investigate the Alabastren Temple Ruins. Why don't you ask him if he needs help, too.|
20800|The Gnomes have put a lot of explosives in the Ruins, quickly splash water on them and they should fizzle.|
20801|After the machine made some noises, a piece of paper filled with symbols came out from it.|
20802|The Resistor gave out an electric wave, rendering the Mainframe Soldier motionless.|
20803|You put the weak Mistwalker Elder into the sack and bring him back to look for Omar.|
20804|The villagers sang and danced around the altar happily, laughing time and again. You joined in too, and enjoyed a joyous ceremony with the villagers.|
20805|You are our hero!|
20806|Thank you!|
20807|Ohh--Yay!|
20808|The ceremony this year is just fantastic!|
20809|Let's dance now!|
20810|Some Pirates are loading boxes... Not sure what they're packing up¡K|
20811|The Village Chief looks like he's busy, and has no time for you.|
20812|Maybe you should go to the village first, and see if you can help out with anything.|
20813|The planning is done, go meet Jess at the Flower Field.|
20814|After taking care of the angry guard, you have to let the Village Chief know about this.|
20815|Anthony's disciple is already heading for the Alabastren Temple Ruins, go meet him there.|
20816|Go to the Alabastren Temple quickly, you have to stop them before the seal is broken!|
20817|You decide to go to the Dwarves' Village to repair this broken down machine.|
20818|The competition is about to begin.|
20819|What the hell... I definitely will not let you take Selena away!|
20820|A girl who went after her dreams fell in love with a pirate leader, who gave up everything to be with her.|
20821|This kind of ending isn't so bad, at least... Everyone is safe and sound.|
20822|You returned to Helonia. You have to tell Madeline the truth.|
20823|Are you the person I'm expecting to meet?|
20824|Amon: Heh heh, looks like your hunting skill is just so so, Tanner|
20825|Amon: Oh? Looks like this is going to be interesting.|
20826|Amon: You've almost caught up with me. Now I have to get serious!|
20827|Amon: Mmm... Let me add it up... What, it's actually the same?|
20828|There's another person who's also possessed by the spirit? Gotta ask Willie to find out where they are.|
20829|Brian hid in the cavern in front... Gotta get Joel out no matter what!|
20830|The Parrot lives in the forest west of Helonia. Looks like quite a distance to walk...|
20831|To get the Alchemist to take part, you must travel to Bella's Orchard.|
20832|Hopefully these Spicy Apple Escargot will convince Perry to take part.|
20833|Luther is disguised and is in the Pirates Camp. Go meet him, quickly!|
20834|The keys to the Treasure Chest are with the Lunarin Chief. Get ready to start a new journey!|
20835|Not being able to borrow the keys has left you a little disappointed...
However, you saw a young girl in the village, who looks very troubled. Maybe she needs some help.|
20836|The threat from the Flowertraps looms larger; better destroy some Flowertraps before meeting Jess.|
20837|Maybe the Scholar at Clark Farm will know about the Wax Seal and the Ceremonial Tome|
20838|The Templar from the Church is waiting for you outside Navea.|
20839|Even the Ceremonial Stones have been lost after the shrine was taken over by Gnomes. I must let the Village Chief know about this.|
20840|The Mistwalker Invaders represent the army most well-versed in the art of battle in the Mistwalker Tribe, I gotta take care of them first!|
20841|The seal of the shrine is already broken. You must not let the strength of the shrine end up in Makar hands.|
20842|Looks like I have to go to the Cactakara Forest if I want to repair this ancient machine.|
20843|After this, I'll use the Halo Energy Detector to find the location of the Collectors...|
20844|Rallied by the commander, the Makar Warriors let out a roar of fierce, fighting spirit, and are ready for the battle!|
20845|Disguised as a Giant Woodbeast, you can avoid the guard's notice and reactivate the Teleporter!|
20846|You've finally obtained the Halo Grass; bring it back to Pierre quickly!|
20847|The Crocodiles nearby will attack the spectators if I don't get rid of them before the finals begin.|
20848|Go to the hill to the northwest, and help the collectors bring back the collecting tools left behind there.|
20849|The thief is hiding on the northeastern side. Use the Electrifier to subdue her!|
20850|Gotta take some Butterfly Fairy Eggs to Fenrich, to get help finding the energy source.|
20851|The energy source is under the waterfall on the northeastern side. Looks like you're gonna get wet.|
20852|The Spirit Separator is of no use at all... Looks like you gotta return to Navea and ask the Grand Bishop why.|
20853|Victoria gives you two bottles of disinfectant, and cautions you once again to be sure that you use them.|
20854|You carefully spray the disinfectant all around you.|
20855|You saw young Bonita waving at you, looking rather troubled.|
20856|Bobby should be heading in the direction of the Pitmere Canyon, along the path westwards. Head up the path to find him.|
20857|This should be Bobby's package; his name is written on it, after all.|
20858|If the leader is defeated, the Scavenger Bird will keep to itself; go to the clifftop, use bait to lure the Leader out.|
20859|Bobby will be staying under the care of Luther and Rebecca, so you have to bring Bobby's map back to town.|
20860|Get rid of the Spring Waterling in the north before going back.|
20861|The Investigation Team is already prepared to go to the places Bobby marked and rescue the hostages.|
20862|First, defeat the Slimeling in the north that's obstructing the way. Then, go meet up with the Investigation Team Members with whom you've lost contact.|
20863|Floyd can be a little impatient, so if he's rude to you in any way, please bear with him.|
20864|Floyd looks, angrily, at the Witch next to him; the Witch remains expressionless and silent.|
20865|Don't waste your effort; no matter how many times these Protectors have been destroyed, they will continue to live again.|
20866|The Witch, who has been silent so far, startled you when she suddenly began to speak.|
20867|Kargula is unhappy, his holy wrath oppressing your mind and body.|
20868|Kargula is very happy that you've made an accurate judgement!|
20869|Move forward to the next flag with a guiding light spot and destroy it.|
20870|Kargula's final test begins!|
20871|Kargula Hyper Incarnation is here! Use all your might to defeat him!|
20872|The Village Chief's wife has something to tell you, follow her and listen.|
20873|The bucket of explosives is drenched, and cannot be ignited.|
20874|Amon: What are you doing?! You aren't thinking of chickening out are you?|
20875|Amon: The Tanner that I know isn't a coward!|
20876|Amon: You can't barge in here, get back to your own position!|
20877|You can't leave the Hunting Ground during the competition, go back to your stronghold.|
20878|You follow behind the Village Chief's Wife as she slowly leaves Port Skandia, heading in the direction of the Helonia Coast...|
20879|The Chief's Wife's sadness for your departure is written all over her face...|
20880|Catseye Herald: You wait right here, no tricks. The leader is almost here.|
20881|Following that, steady footsteps can be heard from the front....|
20882|Your stronghold on the left is destroyed! You lost!|
20883|Amon: Hahaha! So, you aren't that powerful after all, Tanner!|
20884|Amon: Who was that person who just now pledged that he will have the proprietary rights of the Hunting Ground?|
20885|Amon: Hmmph, since you've lost, then get out of my Hunting Ground!|
20886|After this fierce offensive and defensive warfare, Leader Tanner lost the combat.|
20887|So...|
20888|The fight for the Hunting Ground between the Hunters Group and the Stone Hammer Tribe continues...|
20889|An azure light orb floats next to you, making you rather ill at ease....|
20890|A few garrison members have surrounded Brian, locked in a face-off!|
20891|Tanner Jones, Leader of the Hunters' Team, has won.|
20892|Both parties returned to the Stone Hammer Camp, and negotiated for the last time.|
20893|Finally, Tanner, the Team Leader, wins this round of the competition.|
20894|He made a promise to share the Hunting Ground with Chief Amon.|
20895|Nothing happened!|
20896|Garrison troops again? Looks like this is the right route!|
20897|Get to the end with the little boy, and obtain victory!|
20898|First Village Chief: Help!|
20899|First Village Chief: A bunch of Spiders are coming! Drive them back!|
20900|After you activate the Halo Energy Detector, the device indicates that there's wave activity on the mountain path.|
20901|After the second round of Halo Energy Detecting, it looks like the wave source should be ahead.|
20902|Vhell pointed the sword at you, and you were instantly surrounded by a strong magic power.|
20903|You are unable to withstand Vhell's strength; looks like breaking out by force will not work...|
20904|You follow Akers's instructions and reactivate the Teleporter - you can use it to go in and out of the Ruins now!|
20905|An air of chilling terror envelopes you. Your instinct tells you that you don't want to stay here for long.|
20906|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'East City Mountain Pass.'"|
20907|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'East City Ruins.'"|
20908|Water Purifier No.1 lets out a low, mechanical sound, and releases a purifying agent.|
20909|Water Purifier No.2 was not successfully activated, until you kicked it into action.|
20910|You place Water Purifier No.3 near the waterfall, and the activation process is successful.|
20911|Caroline moves backwards, slowly, in high alert. Quickly, use the Electrifier and shock her into unconsciousness before she manages to escape!|
20912|A strong light emits from Caroline's body, and a figure scurries out of the bright light.|
20913|When you entered Brevis, a powerful electromagnetic wave immediately made you feel ill at ease.|
20914|For safety's sake, you quickly retreated from the region of electromagnetic waves activity.|
20915|The Collectors gratefully thank you for the herbal ointment.|
20916|After Vhell discovered you, a chilly, terrifying air immediately fills up the space between you.|
20917|You again! I've already warned you... Now you shall face my fury!|
20918|The Detector projected electric waves at Vhell, and he was momentarily unable to resist the powerful force.|
20919|Vhell was affected by the Shrink-Ray, his huge body becoming very small...|
20920|You've already chased all the aggressive creatures out of this area. The entrance in the east is safe.|
20921|After careful inspection, the western entrance is sure to be safe.|
20922|The Robot Competition Finals are about to begin; you shall pilot the Augustus Mk.VII in the finals yourself!|
20923|After you've entered the cockpit, you can control four commands. They are: 
Heavy Fist (Attack), Defense Barrier (Defense), Defense Crumbled (Defense broken down), Halo Repair (Restore).|
20924|Use these skills appropriately, pay attention to the opponent's actions and moves, and lay claim the trophy at the Finals!|
20925|Alain: Let's welcome last competition's champion, God-Hand Montero!|
20926|Montero drives the Montebrown Mk. 5 out of the machine's storeroom, and slowly walks up the stage.|
20927|Montero opens the firing holes on his shoulders, firing pyrotechnic bullets into the sky.|
20928|The dazzling fireworks dance in the sky, bringing the scene to a climax.|
20929|Unexpected results has fired up the audience at the scene.|
20930|After you've left the cockpit, the audience swarmed you with praise.|
20931|As the audience slowly disperses, peace and quiet finally returns to the Competition Arena.|
20932|After careful searching, you saw a hidden cave under the waterfall.|
20933|You've drawn some blood samples from the Caustic Sarpa with the blood extractor.|
20934|You hit the Sleeping Lumberjack, hard, with Caine's Hammer.|
20935|You caught the Wild Parrot and imprisoned it in the wooden cage.|
20936|The blowdart hit the Porter: bag him before the effect wears off!|
20937|A Pirate from a tent in the distance is signalling to you to go over to him.|
20938|After inspecting, you can be sure that the eastern side of the Orchard is safe.|
20939|Apart from a few fleeing Tanuki, nothing special came up on the road.|
20940|Robinson is busily negotiating with the Hunting Village Chief; take the opportunity to get some information from the villagers.|
20941|The Toucants live outside the village. If you want to capture them, you'll have to make a trip out of the village.|
20942|Gotta collect some Cactus Sap first. With that and the recommendation letter, you can go to the Hunting Ground and rescue the Hunters.|
20943|Looks like Durango already has the goods loaded; he's just waiting for you to set out.|
20944|Faint sounds of footsteps can be heard ahead; there's a person coming in this direction.|
20945|Many Pirates have appeared in the area, fight carefully!|
20946|All the Pirates in the area have been defeated. You can continue to move forward.|
20947|Elite Pirates elite appear ahead; they will use the highly damaging Tornado Spin.|
20948|After getting rid of the obstructing Pirates, you can continue to move forward.|
20949|The box beside the wall contains traps, maybe they will come in handy.|
20950|This trap looks like it can stop enemies from moving, maybe it will be useful.|
20951|Giant Jordan, the Abyss Axe Leader, appears before you!|
20952|The skill of the Abyss Axe Leader is great; remember to evade when attacked.|
20953|The Abyss Axe Leader is very powerful, quick, evade!|
20954|Quickly confirm the state of the battle with Reid!|
20955|The other Golden Flowertraps have heard you shouting, and rushed over to grab the Fragrant Mushrooms from your hand.|
20956|After all the Golden Flowertraps have been destroyed, the Greedy Merchant quickly runs in, searching for something.|
20957|Get the Fragrant Mushroom from the Greedy Merchant's assistant, and use it to lure the Golden Flowertrap out!|
20958|Bang! The Golden Flowertrap is finally being lured out!|
20959|The valuable gold is finally retrieved. Return it to the Merchant, and advise him to help the poor and the weak more in the future!|
20960|The Greedy Merchant looks very anxious, ask him what's the matter!|
20961|Sounds can be heard from Heaven...|
20962|Kargula: You shall soon face your last test.|
20963|Kargula: You didn't focus enough! Do it again!|
20964|Do away with the flag in front that has a guiding light-spot|
20965|Kargula: As long as you do what you've done before, you should pass, if you keep your wits about you.|
20966|Kargula: The test shall soon begin.|
20967|Kargula: You've proven that you've superb observation skills.|
20968|Kargula: Show me all your talents then!|
20969|You've collected all the Fragrant Mushrooms. Go lure the Golden Flowertrap out!|
20970|Your stronghold in the center has been destroyed, you lost!|
20971|Your stronghold on the right has been destroyed, you lost!|
20972|Tanner: The stronghold is being attacked, boys, repair it!|
20973|Tanner: Quickly, restore the Defense fortification! You don't want to be beaten up by the Giants, right?!|
20974|Tanner: This is urgent; don't let the Defense fortification be destroyed!|
20975|In this round of the competition, you must battle with the Stonehammer Chief.

Giants will charge from three directions and attack your stronghold; you must lead the hunters between these three points in order to defend the stronghold.

Your Hunter Group will wait for you to give orders before launching the attack.|
20976|When you want to give orders, please go to the blue column behind them.
As the Team Leader, you will have two skills: Open Fire (Attack) and Reconstruct Stronghold (Restore).|
20977|At every stronghold, you need to have at least two intact defense fortifications in order to claim victory.|
20978|Perhaps the Witch is not an enemy after all. Let's try her method first.|
20979|As long as you use Hazel's spell at the Caerment Altar, you will be able to know all about the things that happened at this location.|
20980|So the Witch and the Shadow Knight know each other. It seems she has some secrets that she doesn't want to reveal.|
20981|However, the most important task at hand is to ensure that the hostages are safe. Quickly, go back and report all that you've seen.|
20982|If the source of the mutation comes from the Demarech Pool, maybe it's better to ask for Rebecca's help. She's familiar with this place.|
20983|Do you want to investigate the Demarech Pool? Let me be the one to assist you!|
20984|Bobby regains consciousness. He still sounds rather weak.|
20985|Rebecca sees that you are about to leave, and stops you. It seems like she has something to ask you.|
20986|The Shock Core resonated with the Miracle Rock Monster, and the Rock Monster's body began to disintegrate.|
20987|These Light Orbs are scattered around the Demarech Pool. Go destroy them.|
20988|The Light Orbs give out a strong flashing light and quickly disappear.|
20989|My father is still trapped in the mine in the north. I have to go save him.|
20990|Your injuries have not healed yet, don't push yourself too hard.|
20991|Bobby is still worried about his father's safety. You better go to the Demarech Mines District and see if the rescue operation is successful.|
20992|The residents nearby look rather tired, send the water to them quickly.|
20993|I'm not sure why the Shadow Knight wants these stones, but I'm sure he's up to no good.|
20994|We should keep The Shadow Knight from taking these ores.|
20995|In order to understand the purpose of the Miracle Stone, invite the Foreman over for a chat.|
20996|You took advantage of the Foreman's fatigue and used a rope to tie him up!|
20997|Quickly, bring the Foreman back to the camp to look for Nate.|
20998|The area has already been taken over by the Rock Beetles - this would be the work of the Shadow Knight.|
20999|There are still a number of Miners digging nearby. Seems like the Shadow Knight needs a huge volume of Miracle Ore.|
21000|You've done well, you should be able to stop the Shadow Knight, now.|
21001|You guys are too naive, this is just one of the Shadow Knight's excavation sites.|
21002|Actually the Mine in the east is his main target.|
21003|Old man, What proof do you have? You sound like you know the Shadow Knight very well.|
21004|You are stunned by what the old man said; could he have some connection with the Shadow Knight?|
21005|I can't believe that you are actually Analisa's master. I was really impolite just now.|
21006|No worries; young people are usually a little impatient, I don't mind.|
21007|Harvey says, with a complacent smile.|
21008|Go to the Marauder Camp, and get rid of the Marauder Patrolmen. Then tell Hamilton, the Investigator, about the Shadow Knight's plan.|
21009|The Miners are gathered at the Mining Area in the north. Go get the map from them, quickly!|
21010|Quickly defeat the Marauder Captain and get the Miracle Crystal back; you must not let the Shadow Knight get the Crystal.
|
21011|Luckily, the Miracle Crystal has not been sent to the Shadow Knight yet. Take it back to Hamilton.|
21012|Vice Leader Floyd can't wait to send someone into the Miner's Steppe.|
21013|I'm not sure what kind of ambush the enemies have set up inside. You better get in there quickly, and help him.|
21014|Harvey seems to have something important to tell you. Go quickly to the Mine in the West and look for him.|
21015|The things in the box on the side, get them out now.|
21016|The Shadow Knight has already gotten the Cube of Gaia. You have to go back immediately and report to the Grand Bishop.|
21017|Amon: Ok, cease fire!|
21018|However, he didn't find Bluto the Pirate Adjutant's corpse.|
21019|After this, you will play as Isaac, to experience the sneaking into the Pirates Camp to give out the treasures.|
21020|When you are Isaac, you will have a skill: Show Treasure. 
When you use it at the designated location, you can show the fake treasure to the Pirates.|
21021|You have to show the treasure to four different guards and Adjutant Bluto in order to complete your plan.|
21022|The Scavenger Bird King let out a shrill cry, scaring away the Scavenger Birds nearby.|
21023|In order to stop the endless fighting with the Stone Hammer Tribe,|
21024|Tanner Jones, Leader of the Hunters' Team, decides to negotiate directly with Chief Amon of the Stone Hammer Tribe.|
21025|With that, he took a few Hunters and went to the Stone Hammer Tribe in person.|
21026|Loud rumbling sounds come from beneath the ground--a gigantic beetle is trying to dig its way out of the ground!|
21027|You do not have the Fragrant Mushrooms with you, please go down to collect some from the Mushroom Heap.|
21028|Use the Fragrant Mushrooms, the Golden Flowertrap's favorite food, and tempt it into not eating gold coins again.|
21029|The breath of resentful ghosts nearby is fouls this place.|
21030|The Ghost Crystal Miner gave out a big roar, and pounced on you.|
21031|Please go to Tomitsa at Demarech Mines to look for Annie.|
21032|The Eidolon's Energy miraculously enabled the Totem to renew itself. However, it seems that it isn't completely restored.|
21033|The Gaia Cube glowed with Eidolon Energy. It looks like something is going to happen.|
21034|The energy-filled Gaia Cube starts to release power, filling the air with turbulence!|
21035|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, "Iron Titan" Gigas!|
21036|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the radiant Eidolon, Aelius - "Knight of the Sun"!|
21037|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the terribly powerful Eidolon, Eligos - the "Duke of Darkness"!|
21038|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the incredible Eidolon, Sigrun - "Champion of the Slain"!|
21039|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the immensely powerful Eidolon, "Empress of Torment" Bel-Chandra!|
21040|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, Uzuriel - the "Heavenly Defender"!|
21041|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the electrifying Eidolon, Vayu the "Stormbringer"!|
21042|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, "Miasmic Serpent" Quelkulan!|
21043|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the incredible Eidolon, "Emerald Tempest" Yarnaros!|
21044|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, Bahadur the "Trampling Thunder"!|
21045|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the cunning Eidolon, Kotonoha the "Nine-Tailed Vixen"!|
21046|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the cunning Eidolon, "Feline Emperor" Tigerius Caesar!|
21047|Please report your Quest to the Grand Merchant before leaving here!|
21048|Head to the north and find Gump, and teach the little penguin you meet on the way a lesson!|
21049|The warriors of Falco are waiting for you in front.|
21050|The Falco have already launched an attack! Quickly, join with the three Eagles!|
21051|The Three Eagles demonstrated an exuberant fighting spirit, which demoralised the enemies around them!|
21052|The just, fighting spirit of justice of the Three Eagles can demoralise enemies!|
21053|Continue to move forward, there are still many enemies waiting for us in front!|
21054|There are some hostages being held not too far ahead!|
21055|The hostages were successfully rescued!|
21056|The alcohol in the Crazy Avian, Kafei, exploded from its body! It went into a state of turbulence.|
21057|The Falco will be here waiting for enemies. While they're distracted, go to the small house on the western side and rescue the hostages.|
21058|The Falco reinforcements are here!|
21059|Be careful! The Red Colt Clan's raiders have gotten behind us.|
21060|Kafei: Don't be afraid brother! I'm coming!|
21061|Be careful! The the Red Colt Clan is gonna ambush us!|
21062|The Red Colt Clan's army is in disarray; only the Clan's Chief, Zibo, is left!|
21063|Zibo, Chief of the Red Colt Clan, has arrived!|
21064|Zibo: So, that Cowardly Barlo actually managed to scrounge up some help! But it doesn't matter - I won't be defeated!|
21065|Zibo ignites the demonic energy and flies into a rage!|
21066|You join forces with the Three Eagles and finally defeated the legendary Zibo!|
21067|Oscar: Wahahahaha! I'm here to get my treasure back!|
21068|Mina: Oh my god! Is there anyone who can stop Oscar?|
21069|Excellent...The retreat to the Hunting Village is still safe. Looks like we don't have to worry about being surrounded.|
21070|Oops... The Giants' vanguard is already very near Drake and the rest!|
21071|It should be enough to put the broken stone pieces into the reagent... We'll just see what Dallan can derive from that.|
21072|The Giants' Weapon might be related to the creature that Wyatt is investigating, so go see him.|
21073|Wyatt said someone has been abducted by Avians, probably for a sacrifice. Could it be the missing Roger?|
21074|The giant monster, Argus, is headed for Deep's Cavern. Go and tell Robinson, quickly!|
21075|In order to get more information about Deep's Cavern, gotta meet the soldiers outside the Cave.|
21076|The Hunting Group Leader who is now battling the Giants might know whether the barrier is of the Giants' making.|
21077|There seemed to be some disturbance at the northern end of the Stone Hammer Tribe's territory not too long ago. Looks like it's necessary to do a search.|
21078|Chase away the Dimetrodon that's occupying the mountain path in the north! Make sure that Roger can return safely.|
21079|Maya says that the barrier of Deep's Cavern has been removed. Maybe you should go and verify it?|
21080|Argus, created by the Shadow Knight, has obtained an enormous strength. We gotta ensure that he doesn't leave the Cave!|
21081|This has finally come to a conclusion. Now go back to Navea and let the Grand Bishop know about the situation here.|
21082|The slender physique of humans is really an asset to investigative work... Use this advantage to investigate the Rebel Army's Camp!|
21083|Go to the town square of Candetonn and set off the fireworks.|
21084|Is this the gate of the Rebel Army's Camp? There seems to be an injured person at the side...|
21085|Take Tiny's bag and bloodstained bracelet with you and sneak into the Rebel Army's Camp to meet up with Tatiana.|
21086|Go to the Squad Leader and read out Tatiana's Secret Order. If he doesn't surrender, get rid of him!|
21087|You set the nearby supply boxes on fire with the torch. Fanned by the wind, it grew quickly into a big fire.|
21088|You set the supplies near the commissary on fire - the Rebel Army's supply line is now seriously disrupted.|
21089|A ferocious fire dances menacingly before you. The outcome of this battle has been more or less fixed!|
21090|Micha, the Rebel Army General, has been captured alive! Bring him to trial in front of Leo!|
21091|Go to the Leyline Arena and meet the imperial craftsmen, they will custom-make exclusive equipment for you.|
21092|In order to have the Battle Soul's blessings on the armor, you have to challenge the Guardian at Swineloch.|
21093|Wake the War Spirit up so that Pascal can put the War Spirit's blessings onto your outfit.|
21094|After that, you have to go to Filthrun Croft, and try to get the Guardian to bless your weapon.|
21095|Bring the Energy Breath of Quick Flame back to the Leyline Arena, and let it become the source of your great fighting strength.|
21096|The battle is threatening, between the Makar and the Gnomes! Mummer, the warlord on the front line, will need your support.|
21097|You finally obtained the antidote! You gotta rush back to the Ventos Tribe quickly with it.|
21098|Go together with Para Ryan to see the Waterhole Guardian, and persuade him to let you go search the Shrine for the antidote.|
21099|In order to save his brothers, Para Ryan dashed into the Shrine without care. Go after him, quickly!|

21110|Tatiana shifts herself into a battle stance and attacks!|
21111|You read out the Secret Order in front of the Rebel Squad Leader, trying your best to get him to surrender.|
21112|As the heraldic seal emits a strong light, you feel a surge of strength being passed into your body.|
21113|Adonis swiftly brandishes his weapon and charged towards you!|
21114|You rope the Wild Rhino with the extremely tough lasso, and force it to follow you.|
21115|You clutch the Oracle Ointment close to your chest, hurrying back to the Ventos Tribe...|
21116|The "Leyline Arena" is the most important event in Makar traditional sports...|
21117|Kargula: Target on every monster and suss out those that are of different states.|
21118|You've finally defeated the Demon! Quickly, get the sprite out!|
21119|Due to your contribution, Leo Ryan, the Makar King, allows  you to participate in this grand event, challenging the elite of the Makar in the arena.|
21120|This will be your best chance to win the respect of the Makar. Try your best to win!|
21121|The First Village Chief walked back.|
21122|Protect Billy and defeat the Grudge Robots blocking the path.|
21123|The members of  garrison continue to run out from within; looks like we have to defeat them in order to continue moving forward.|
21124|Please protect the Little Boy and move forward.|
21125|First Village Chief: I can only rely on you... Kill the Mother Spider and bring back the Spider Silk.|
21126|We got enough Spider Silk. Now go back and report it to Village Chief!|

21128|In order to help the villagers, please look for the Smelly Arachnid Spider Eggs and Smelly Arachnid Silk!|
21129|Follow Meira and continue to move forward.|
21130|The Priestess blocked the way into the Altar Sacred Grounds, so Meira went to talk with her.|
21131|Continue to follow Meira, she might have the right idea!|

21144|The Gigantic Tyrant Robot comes near you - open fire! Do not be merciful!|
21145|Success! You've defeated the Gigantic Tyrant Robot!|
21146|When the Gigantic Tyrant Robots fell, the other Robots in the barren well stopped operating.|
21147|You've successfully helped the soldiers at the barren well defeat the ballistic robots.|
21148|In the meantime, your group should go back to the temporary stronghold at the barren well for a while.|
21149|You've been hit by the "Master Control Program" move! Next time, use the "Superconductive Barrier" to defend against it!|
21150|Gigantic Tyrant Robot: System... Fail, Execute... Self-destruct system...|
21151|Electromagnetic Turret: Detecting... driver is in danger, activate safety system.|
21152|For a long time we've been oppressed by the humans and can only live in this gloomy cave.|
21153|But the Human with the mysterious Cube appeared, and granted us new Strength.|
21154|And now, stronger than before, we are no longer afraid of you!|
21155|Enough! Let me show you the power of the Templars! Everyone, ready to attack!|
21156|The Templars started to attack the Sarpa Leader.|
21157|Just when you're ready to attack together, the Eidolon suddenly stopped you.|
21158|All in a sudden, a lot of Arachnids burst out from the front ground.|
21159|What the hell are these?|
21160|Ah! It's an ambush!|
21161|I feel terribly unwell......|
21162|The villagers gather at the entrance of the altar to thank you.|
21163|Kargula: Young one, accept the trial that I have for you; follow my guidance to pass the test.|
21164|Low furious roars resounding in the air: How dare you wake me up from a sleep that's hard to come by...|
21165|Rude humans, I shall make you pay for this!|
21166|Nine-Tailed Vixen, Kotonoha, said in a coquettish voice:  Looks like someone misses me...|
21167|Ohhhhh, I know everything that you guys are thinking about...|
21168|Which pathetic person is summoning me, and disturbing my well-planned journey?|
21169|Quick! Get it over and done with. Don't waste my time.|
21170|Hmm, chaos is the most primitive state. It's the same for everyone.|
21171|The foolish humans actually think they've grown so much that they can follow the norm. How naive is that?|
21172|Only those who have passed my trial have the right to see themselves as innocent.|
21173|Come and surrender yourselves, sinful people! Only then can I give you a chance to atone for your sins.|
21174|No matter how rigorous a challenge is, it is just a test. You don't have to fear.|
21175|You are only able to grow by overcoming the obstacles ahead. Come, show your true capabilities!|
21176|Ha, the lowly humans want to challenge me? As you wish; it's your death!|
21177|You really want to experience the death? Let me grant your wish!|
21178|Keep a devoted and kind heart always, and I will protect you.|
21179|As for you with evil intentions, you will be justly punished.|
21180|The insignificant humans want to take me on? You have truly overestimated yourselves.|
21181|You will see how much I deserve the title of Unrivaled Strongman!|
21182|You should immediately go down on your knees and worship me, the Great King!|
21183|Looks like I have to educate you on how to act like a respectful and submissive official!|
21184|Hahaha, I finally have the opportunity to show off my skills!|
21185|I've waited for this moment for a long time, stop this nonsense! Come over here and accept your death!|
21186|A deep low muttering comes from the distance, "Be prepared to die. Painfully."|
21187|I'll let you all experience, deeply, what it's like to not be able to live, and yet not die...|
21188|The Wolfmen in the camp have been successfully eliminated.|
21189|The attack ended after the bats jumped into the fire.|
21190|However, the way the bats jumped into the fire just now, almost as if it was against their will, has left you with a weird feeling.|
21191|The bats went into the Corpser Camp, under Mia's control, and completed the elimination mission.|
21192|The bat has three skills:
Wild Wing Slash (Ranged Attack)
Vampire for a Day (HP Absorbing Attack)
Squeaky Summons (Summons Allies)|
21193|Eradicate all the targets that Mia, the Right-Wing Butterfly, has marked in the camp, to complete this mission.|
21194|Bergen: Are you the person that Koral found to help out?|
21195|Bergen: I don't know what you guys have done at the Altar.|
21196|Bergen: However, since you dare to come here alone, I shall reward you amply!|
21197|Hmm, you are quite skilled. Let me see if you can pass this tough wave.|
21198|Koral: Don't be too arrogant, Bergen!|
21199|Koral uses magic on the Stone Golem, causing it to break into lifeless stone pieces.|
21200|Bergen: Koral, what have you done?!|
21201|Bergen: I'll let you guys see the absolutely invincible King of Stone.|
21202|Koral: It's pointless!|
21203|King of Stone loses its power and disintegrates into stone pieces.|
21204|Bergen: What did you do to the King of Stone?!|
21205|Koral: I've realized how your magic works, and have stopped its power.|
21206|Mmm...Looks like the door is ok. It just needs a little repairing, that's all.|
21207|Bergen: Grrr. No one should try to stop me!|
21208|Battle Zone|
21209|Bergen: I know who you are! I will be back!|
21210|Bergen quickly teleports away.|
21211|Koral: Beat the Stone Golem, and recover the Magic Core.|
21212|Koral arrived at the Altar right after you.|
21213|Quickly take the Magic Energy Core to the Altar in the southwest (60, 50).|
21214|By hiding in the Large Urn, Halton was able to sneak into the Mistwalker Camp.

Now he needs to avoid being spotted by the robots so he can recover the Ceremonial Tome and the Ceremonial Vessel.|
21215|Anthony the Craftsman gave Halton a few skills to help him sneak past the robots:

Harmful Interference will immobilize nearby robots, though they can still see him and sound the alarm.
Beam Me Up will transport Halton to wherever the Electroreceptor is.

|
21216|Halton's Electroreceptor can help find the Stolen Ceremonial Tome and the Ceremonial Vessel. Interact with it to begin its search.

When the Electroreceptor comes to a stop, look nearby for traces of the Tome or the Vessel.

If you get separated from the Electroreceptor, use the "Beam Me Up" skill to instantly transport to its location.|
21217|Halton retrieved the Stolen Ceremonial Tome and the Ceremonial Vessel successfully.|
21218|After meeting with the Foreman, Potter, the two of them left the Mistwalker Camp in a hurry.|
21219|Let's leave here, quickly.|
21220|Foolish villains, how dare you trick me! Now you die!|
21221|Please tell Faye this bad news!|
21222|After you've taken the Crescent Gem to the Altar, the people of Lunarin Village gathered at the Altar, preparing for the Ceremony.|
21223|Come come, I'm giving the Nectar Wine away for free today! Let's get drunk, everyone!|
21224|Let me perform the latest dance steps today.|
21225|You are the main focus of this Ceremony, please enjoy yourself to the fullest.|
21226|Even though I can't beat you in a fight, I won't lose a drinking contest! Let's compete and see!|
21227|All the villagers were talking; Potter had been challenged by someone.|
21228|In the distance, a tall man approaches. It seems to be Potter.|
21229|Potter launches a strike in your direction! Don't be careless!|
21230|The Church is looking for you because of the mutations of your body.|
21231|The Eidolon seems interested too; maybe you should look for a Templar.|
21232|The Starlight Treasure Chest has finally been opened, but the problem still cannot be solved.|
21233|You can't help but sigh. The Eidolon pats your back, seemingly tying to console you.|
21234|Lots of Carnivorous Marsh Lizards are nearby, making it rather crowded.|
21235|These Carnivorous Marsh Lizards seem very tense, like they aren't very accustomed to the local environment.|
21236|The Carnivorous Marsh Lizards are vicious; anyone who goes near them will be attacked.|
21237|There is Turtle blood on the Bat's teeth. Find the Turtle, and maybe some clues can be found.|
21238|The soldiers have already left for the Fernscall Woods. Quickly, go and assist them in their investigation.|
21239|I will be heading to the north to investigate. The southern path is all yours.|
21240|The Sarpa Leader was defeated, and the rest of the Sarpa fled in panic.|
21241|There are lots of blood-sucking bats wandering nearby. These bats should be domesticated ones.|
21242|There are many tents opposite the bridge. This should be the camp of the Corpser Bandits.|
21243|The soldiers will take word of the Corpser Bandits back to the village.|
21244|You have to eliminate Vampire Bats in the Corpser Camp first, so they won't cause any more deaths.|
21245|You are disguised as a Wolfman; now sneak into the camp and destroy the totem.|
21246|Mia gave you a small bag to repay you for your help.|
21247|Looks like there's something important in the bag. Take it to Anya as quickly as possible.|
21248|Lucas is a member of the original investigation team. You may find some news there.|
21249|Some investigators are in trouble on the east side of Fernscall Woods, right now. You need to help them first.|
21250|If the Unicorn Spirit has not been contaminated yet, it has an opportunity to recover.|
21251|After gaining the soul energy, examine it carefully. Bring the pure energy back.|
21252|Put the Unicorn Foals in the bag and come back as quickly as possible to protect their safety.|
21253|Put the body fluid of the Arachnid in the glass bottle, and then bring it to the researchers in Fernscall Woods for chemical examination.|
21254|Looks like the cause of the mutation is related to Candeo Core. Go ask the Village Chief about the situation in the Core.|
21255|To keep living creatures here from mutating further, you should clog the spring water's source.|
21256|Get into the Candeo Core of Candeo Marsh and close its water gate.|
21257|Alex asked you to go back and report the good news first. He needs to be alone.|
21258|Anya asks you to report the investigation results to the Grand Bishop.|
21259|The matter was successfully settled this time, but you still couldn't understand Alex's last response.|
21260|The six Magic Cores were scattered from Koral's hand.|
21261|A Possessed Stone Golem has appeared from the depths of  the Statue Ruins.|
21262|Looks like Bergen has found us. Please help me defeat the Stone Golem.|
21263|Several Stone Golems are approaching. Don't let them stop me.|
21264|Hang in there! I'll figure out the structure of this magic soon.|
21265|Just give me a bit more time. It's almost done!|
21266|The analysis is complete. Now I know how to use this magic!|
21267|Koral: It's not yet the right time to challenge Bergen. Retreat!|
21268|Continue to move forward with Meira.|
21269|Please defeat the Sprite's pet.|
21270|Give the flower crown to the sprite for his blessing, and then give it back to Meira.|
21271|Priestess: Wait! This is a sacred place. Not just anyone can enter!|
21272|Please give the Altar Flower to the Priestess, politely.|
21273|Sprite: So you are Meira and you are her assistant, right?|
21274|Sprite: Let's get started with the first trial!|
21275|Sprite: Later there will be Altar Dryads all over this place.|
21276|Sprite: Please use your keen observation to expel the discorded elements.|
21277|Sprite: The image represents a distinction between right and wrong, is also the basis for blessing marriage with harmony.|
21278|Sprite: That's right. Keep going to the next one.|
21279|Sprite: That's the spirit. One more left.|
21280|Sprite: You have passed this test. Now move on to the next challenge!|
21281|The Path ahead is open!|
21282|Sprite: The previous test was to test your wits. Now it's time to test your courage.|
21283|Sprite: Now you must challenge my pet to prove your bravery.|
21284|Sprite: Do not be fooled by its cute and disarming look.|
21285|Sprite: Congratulations on passing the trial! Please take the Flower Crown, and come up to the altar!|
21286|Please pick up the Altar Flower, and defeat the wild monsters which may appear.|
21287|Meira has finished making the Flower Crown. Please follow her to the Priestess.|
21288|Find three different Altar Dryads and defeat them.|
21289|Great! Dressing like this allows me to walk here unnoticed!|
21290|Halton hid inside the large urn, and managed to sneak into the Mistwalker Camp.
Now you need to stir up a commotion inside the camp to provide cover for Halton!|
21291|To avoid unnecessary loss, Koral asked you to come back.|
21292|Bergen ordered two Stone Golems to attack you.|
21293|Do you want to know the flavor of my lips? Come closer, hehehe.|
21294|Due to the power of the Gaia Cube, powerful Eidolons are descending. All Envoys of Gaia, please go to the Cube!|
21295|Bergen summoned a bunch of Stone Golems to attack you|
21296|Keep going deeper into the Ruins. I will catch up as soon as I figure out this magic.|
21297|After the joyful ceremony ended, you headed back to Lunarin to speak to the Village Chief. Hopefully he hasn't forgotten about the key he promised you.|
21298|Sprite: Wrong! Please observe more carefully!|
21299|Really experience this memory. Maybe it will inspire you.|
21300|After using spells, you felt dizzy.|
21301|The Toucant is firmly tangled in the rope you threw out. Take it back to the Village, and give it to Kara!|
21302|Emergency! Gotta let Drake know about this. Prepare to engage in battle if necessary...|
21303|The Crystal Ball was emitting dazzling light, but suddenly, something in the sky disrupted the magic.|
21304|As two mutually exclusive magics repulsed each other in the sky, Officiant Zujahla's silhouette slowly appeared!|
21305|How could this be possible... I was hiding in another dimension...|
21306|Humans! You are behind all of this, aren't you? You will have to pay the price!|
21307|As per Rachel's instruction, you now have to use the Blowdart Tranquilizer to paralyze the Dimetrodon.|
21308|At this point, the Eldest Prince took out a bottle of unknown Potion and drank it.|
21309|Juno piled up a little of the wood, then took out a flint to start a fire.|
21310|Badly injured, Roger was nodding at you and smiling gratefully.|
21311|Your hearts are filled with evil. You are all sinners!|
21312|The Electromagnetic Turret detected a threat, so it generated an electric wave to protect you and send you back to a safety zone.|
21313|If the Totem can absorb more energy, maybe we then can see its true power...|
21314|Oh!|
21315|Hold on... Movement up front.|
21316|The Sarpa Leader and its crew walked over from the distance.|
21317|So, you're the commander of these Sarpa? I thought you would all be hiding!|
21318|Again, brave fools invade our territory. You Human Beings just never learn.|
21319|Do you want to end up like the last humans who invaded?|
21320|Shut up! We Templars want you to pay for Lucas's death!|
21321|Demon: Hmph! Don't you even think of stopping my resurrection!|
21322|You did not pick up Ceremonial Vessel. Please check Backpack space and try up again.|
21323|Astaire Maledicto says, "Come back! You'll never get out of my territory!"|
21324|You successfully destroyed the Magic Barrier of the Corpser Bandits, and obtained the Totem.|
21325|While the Bandits were in chaos, you left the camp, still in disguise.|
21326|I've warned you so many times, and since you still don't learn, then I will deal with you myself.|
21327|Weak human like you, I can easily defeat you by myself!|
21328|Odum left to take the letter with him to the negotiation.|
21329|You haven't completed your mission yet. It's not the right time to go back.|
21330|Stop! How did you get in here?|
21331|What were the soldiers outside doing? How could they let someone get inside!|
21332|When the Guard saw Odum, the he stopped him immediately.|
21333|More Silverflash Guards appeared in front.|
21334|Stop him! We can't let him go near the Priest.|
21335|This Makar has great skills. Let's tackle him together!|
21336|He's all alone! Why can't we stop him?|
21337|Silverflash Guards surrounded Odum.|
21338|We can't let you move forward any more. We will do everything we can to stop you.|
21339|Enough! Everybody, stop!|
21340|The Varan Priest walked out, and ordered the guards to stop.|
21341|We've seen your strength.|
21342|I suspect you are not just here to fight. Tell me what you want.|
21343|Priest Shay agreed to negotiate with you. Hurry! Give him Analisa's letter.|
21344|After successfully making a peace agreement with the Silverflash Tribe, Odum came back to tell you and Analisa the good news.|
21345|After that, you went to the Priest to discuss what to do next.|
21346|Tell Fenrich about this discovery as soon as possible. Maybe you can get some clues from him.|
21347|Leonard: Oh, right. Quartermaster Lawrence needs someone to help him right now.|
21348|Leonard: Before you leave, go talk to him first.|
21349|Go out the fortress gate, and go west. Search along the cliff in the northwest.|
21350|These Varan keep moving goods from the North of Fulcheth Forest to the Village.|
21351|Quickly, go north and find out what they're transporting.|
21352|Analisa is still staying in Krok Village. You have to give her the sample.|
21353|Be careful with the Earth Guards outside the Village. They attack anyone who tries to go near them.|
21354|Supplies are in the fortress' warehouse. Deliver them to squad leader Walker at the barren well.|
21355|You have to destroy the outer armor of the Berserker Bouncers and Ballistic Bouncers first, then use the Removal Tool to remove their core.|
21356|You have to pass Forest of Thorns in the north, if you want to go to Tafay Village.|
21357|If you go north, you should be able to meet Vincent, who is out scouting along the way.|
21358|There are a lot of Robot Guards patrolling the periphery of Tafay Village.|
21359|You have to beat these Robots to enter the Village.|
21360|You have to go to Ghostweep Ruins, east of Tafay Village, and ask the Village Chief to stop their mining plan.|
21361|Remember to clear the howling wolves along the way, so that the villagers can evacuate safely.|
21362|The Village Chief went to Ghostweep Cave alone. You have to find him before something bad happens to him.|
21363|It is very dark inside the Ghostweep Cave. You have to use a Lighting Tool to enter it.|
21364|There must be a lot of zombies inside the cave. It's very dangerous for the Village Chief to be there.|
21365|Enter Ghostweep Cave, and bring the Village Chief out safely.|
21366|Not only the soldiers in the fortress, but also the Varan and the Dwarves want to join the battle against the Shadow Knight.|
21367|This will be of great help to future fights with the Shadow Knight's armies.|
21368|You were startled by the signs of someone coming.|
21369|Isn't he the man who was in my dream? I can't believe he is the Shadow Knight!|
21370|Come to your senses. I won't show any mercy!|
21371|Why have you asked people to run errands again? We have to focus on finding the truth, now!|
21372|What's the big deal? It's gonna take a while to get the results, anyway.|
21373|Besides, this might be connected to the event this time.|
21374|You put the poisonous bug inside the box while it's hurt.|
21375|Bring this poisonous bug to Penny!|
21376|Soon after you put the bait on the ground, there were loud footsteps nearby.|
21377|No more commotion! You've already drawn Wolfman's attention!|
21378|You heard a sound in your head, then saw a girl watching you nearby.|
21379|You have to get back some equipment from the Wolfmen before I can move on to the next step.|
21380|You quickly caught the bats in the bag while they weren't paying attention!|
21381|The bats are struggling in the bag. Take them to the camp entrance, quickly.|
21382|After the Bandit Leader was defeated, the camp became chaotic.|
21383|It seems that the Bandits will soon destroy themselves. You better bring the Totem back to Mia first.|
21384|You put the baby Unicorn into the bag carefully. It seemed very scared and kept kicking and struggling.|
21385|You've caught enough Unicorn Foals, take them back to Researcher Archie as soon as possible.|
21386|While the bug was injured, you put the body fluids coming out of the poisonous bug into the glass bottle.|
21387|The soldiers were ordered to follow you. Go to the gathering point in the Sarpa Abyss.|
21388|The Sarpa Leader is at the center of the Sarpa Abyss, giving orders to Sarpa outside Candeo Core.|
21389|You have to defeat the Sarpa Leader, before you can make your attack in Candeo Core.|
21390|Rebel Army Leader Micha kept his promise to surrender after you defeated him.|
21391|Micha lost, but he still showed his pride as a Makar in front of you. He went back to Ventos Tribe with his head held high.|
21392|Let Makar King Leo decide the rest...|
21393|The outcome of the contest was astonishing.|
21394|The Eldest Prince was poisoned by the Gnome's Potion. His body shrank abnormally.|
21395|So everyone went back to the Tribe, trying to find a way to save the Prince.|
21396|Oops! The previous fight has made the Dragon Beasts nearby extremely irritated. This is not good...|
21397|There are Curly-Tailed Chameleons hiding all over this place. The Bandits use them as like watchdogs.|
21398|This is the entrance of the Sand Owl Camp... The road ahead of us won't be easy...|
21399|Jonah was poisoned by Sand Owl bandits. Find a Poison Gland to save his life quickly.|
21400|The Antidote is completed. Hurry up! Inject the Serum into Jonah.|
21401|All the defeated guards and mercenaries have been escorted back to their camp by Sand Owl Bandits.|
21402|It seems that you have to break into the Sand Owl Camp to rescue them!|
21403|Sand Owl Knifemasters are searching for Freddie right now. We have to kill them all first.|
21404|Incredible... Caroline has become even more agile since I last saw her in Cactakara Forest.|
21405|Though you have a lot of things that you wanted to clarify with her, there's no way you two can continue talking under these sort of circumstances.|
21406|At least you've found the treasure map. Hurry up and bring it to Hayes.|
21407|The Exploration Team almost got lost in the Star Sand Desert, due to the mirages.|
21408|Looks like it's necessary to go to the Dune Outpost first, to find the Ozymand Temple...|
21409|Anyway, it's necessary to convince Desert Guide Akara to join the Exploration Team.|
21410|To solve the problem of the shortage of pack animals, you have to capture a strong Armordillo.|
21411|Akara asked you to take a sand shovel to the designated place, and dig up the buried secret.|
21412|(Exactly what plan does Akara have for that dragon egg?)|
21413|According to Akara's instructions, the two kinds of mucus must be poured into the Crystal Bottle. Ew.|
21414|To prevent Moas from rioting, Moa King Kakkan must be kept alive.|
21415|So you have to use the Blowdart Tranquilizer to paralyze it, so that you can gain Flower of Life successfully.|
21416|The things that Akara asked for are finally all here. Hurry up and give the cart to him!|
21417|Pick up a Thermal Crystal Bottle from the cart next to you.|
21418|Pour the liquid inside the Crystal Bottle onto the Flower of Life in order to get Particles of Life.|
21419|Drink the Essence of Life, and fill your body with vital energy.|
21420|Then, pour this energy onto the Dragon Egg, to help the baby dragon hatch!|
21421|After learning that the exploration team was attacked, Akara immediately leads you across the desert.|
21422|Enter the Ozymand Temple to catch the intruders first while the Exploration Team is still assembling!|
21423|The exploration has finally begun! Tell Hayes the good news.|
21424|The successful discovery of the Ozymand Temple has raised Hayes's prestige in the Sanknie Alliance.|
21425|Meanwhile, Hayes promised, on behalf of the Sanknie Alliance, to provide military supplies for the Church.|
21426|Go to Navea and tell the Grand Bishop the good news!|
21427|You will enter the periphery of the Ozymand Temple with Wrenna, and break the seal together.|
21428|To kill the four surrounding Seal Messengers and break the four Seals, you have to follow the instructions from the blue light on the ground step by step.|
21429|Only after the four Seal Messengers and Seals are destroyed, can you then deal with Gatekeeper Imadal.|
21430|Wrenna: "My name's Wrenna. Looks like you can hear me just fine."|
21431|Wrenna: "I am able to to communicate with humans like this."|
21432|Wrenna: "I can sense how special you are; the connection between us right now is quite strong."|
21433|Wrenna: "Follow the blue light on the ground. It will lead you along the right path."|
21434|Wrenna: "I've sensed the power of water from her..."|
21435|Wrenna: "You can break the first seal if you defeat her."|
21436|Wrenna: "Ah... Aah..."|
21437|Wrenna's pained wail made you a little nervous.|
21438|Suddenly, power surged into Wrenna's body, and the dragon stopped wailing.|
21439|Wrenna: Whew...  I'm feeling much better.|
21440|Wrenna: Now that the seal is broken, a part of my strength is awakened.|
21441|Wrenna: Now I can use a new skill, 'Calm Waters.'|
21442|Wrenna: Water can soothe, so it can decrease the target's attack power.|
21443|Wrenna: "Now, let's go break the next seal."|
21444|Wrenna: "This is a particularly malicious foe."|
21445|Wrenna: "Be careful. He's the second Seal Messenger that we need to kill."|
21446|Wrenna: "Oh, this darkness, this evil..."|
21447|Wrenna: "Aaaaah!!!"|
21448|Wrenna shook uncontrollably all over, appearing to be suffering an unimaginable pain.|
21449|Wrenna: Whew... Another part of my strength is awakened...|
21450|Wrenna: Now I can use a new skill, 'Breath of Darkness.'|
21451|Wrenna: Chaos is the purest power. It can ignore the enemy's defenses...|
21452|Wrenna: "...Attack it directly! Alright, hold tight..."|
21453|Wrenna: "His physical body is already dead."|
21454|Wrenna: "But he is still guarding the flame which symbolizes the meaning of life... How ironic!"|
21455|Wrenna: "Just kill him, and bring his misery to an end."|
21456|Wrenna: "Ah...hrrrg..."|
21457|You felt relieved that Wrenna didn't have as strong of a reaction this time.|
21458|Wrenna: Ah... I feel a limitless vitality.|
21459|Wrenna: Now I can use the a skill 'Fire of Life.'|
21460|Wrenna: The power of the flame can quickly repair my damaged tissues.|
21461|Wrenna: One last Seal to break, then we can go handle the Gatekeeper.|
21462|Wrenna: "The last one! I can't wait!"|
21463|Wrenna: "Now that the Seals are broken, I can't wait to deal with the Gatekeeper."|
21464|Wrenna: "Let's go! Finish off the last Seal Messenger."|
21465|Wrenna: "Uh... Whew... Don't worry. I'm already used to it..."|
21466|Wrenna: I am filled with the force of lightning...|
21467|Wrenna: Now I can use a new skill 'Temporal Phase.'|
21468|Wrenna: This power allows me to move through different dimensions to dodge any attack.|
21469|Wrenna: "So, the moment has finally arrived."|
21470|Wrenna: Let's kill the Gatekeeper and break the seal of the Ozymand Temple!|
21471|Everything around you starts to shake, as if a long-suppressed force was bursting out.|
21472|Wrenna: "We made it! We have broken the seal of the Ozymand Temple!"|
21473|Wrenna: "However, it's not time to go in yet..."|
21474|Wrenna: "There are still some things that we need to prepare. Let's get outta here first."|
21475|You and Wrenna successfully broke the seal of the Ozymand Temple.|
21476|But now it's still not time to enter the temple. Go back to report to Akara and Omar first.|
21477|Wrenna: I have a feeling that everything will come to an end, here, today.|
21478|Wrenna: The spirit in you is really unusual. I didn't expect that I could talk to you like this.|
21479|Wrenna: "So, let's get going."|
21480|Suddenly, a wave of strong Electromagnetic Energy surrounded you.|
21481|Gatekeeper: "Pathetic fools! How dare you take such liberties in front of me, the great Imadal?"|
21482|Gatekeeper: "Come here! I'm gonna make you regret what you have done today!"|
21483|Wrenna: Uh... I can't move.|
21484|You and Wrenna couldn't see anything but darkness. You were caught in a flux of powerful Electromagnetic Energy.|
21485|You've been pulled into another dimension.|
21486|When Darkness turns to Light, what is waiting for you...|
21487|A series of unexpected events have demoralised many subdivisions of the Alliance...|
21488|Maybe you should go to the medical team in the Camp and see if you can be of help there.|
21489|There is still a Mercenary Squad fighting with Marauders at Cracked Sand Plain. Hurry. Go join them, take supplies and provide assistance!|
21490|Near Krok Village|
21491|You found footprints, of both adults and children, on the ground.|
21492|You heard the sound of some kids talking, coming from the north. Zachary might be there.|
21493|After they finished talking, you heard a wolf howling in the west.|
21494|Big Bro, I'm so scared!|
21495|Big Bro, come protect us!|
21496|Don't worry. Zachary will protect you!|
21497|Near the Pool in Krok Village|
21498|Deep inside Krok Village|
21499|There are a lot of Guards around the Pool. They must consider the it very important.|
21500|There are a lot of guards patrolling the village. Looks like they're protecting someone very important.|
21501|You filled the Glass Bottle with water.|
21502|You find the water in the pool very clear, and filled with life, unlike the water in Oblitus Wood.|
21503|As you were on your way out, Quartermaster Lawrence waved at you over to him.|
21504|You used the Disassembling Tool to remove the Robot's core, leaving it motionless.|
21505|Thanks for your help. I can finally retreat.|
21506|You used Dwarf tools on ballistic Patrolmen, and successfully removed their Energy Device.|
21507|Thank you for letting me out. I gotta get out of here, fast. See ya.|
21508|After you activated the Robot, it sent out a loud alarm.|
21509|System booting... Large number of enemies detected. Launching an indiscriminate attack.|
21510|The ballistic Robot has a powerful shield. You can't inflict any direct damage on it.|
21511|The Robot is going crazy!|
21512|Go hide somewhere safe from the Robot's attack.|
21513|The ballistic Robot jerked a little and stopped moving.|
21514|People nearby saw the Robot stop moving and started to talk about it.|
21515|What exactly happened? The Robot became so destructive so suddenly.|
21516|You inserted the key and twisted it a little bit. The Energy Collector immediately stopped working.|
21517|While you were turning on the Lighting Device, the Village Chief suddenly came from the side and tried to snatch it away from you!|
21518|Alright... I give up. I'll follow you back.|
21519|When you let your guard down, the Village Chief suddenly snatched the Lighting Device from you!|
21520|I'm not giving up! I will find the new energy!|
21521|The Village Chief turned around quickly, and ran into Ghostweep Cave. You have to tell Sheo about this as soon as possible.|
21522|Don't get distracted by what's going on around you... Continue pouring the Power of Life into the Dragon Egg.|
21523|Something's happening! There's a dim light coming out from the Dragon Egg. Looks like it worked!|
21524|Wow... The Dragon Egg is actively absorbing my strength. I must hang tight!|
21525|Ugh... I can't focus... No... I cannot fall!|
21526|The time is now! Pour all the strength into Dragon Egg so that the Baby Dragon can be born! 
(Use Hotkey 2 to put your strength into the egg.)|
21527|A tiny Dragon broke out of the egg shell and stared at you with big eyes.|
21528|The Baby Dragon called out weakly. Take it to Akara, quickly.|
21529|Take the Baby Dragon to Akara|
21530|Once the Giant Armordillo slowed down, you were able to slip the reins onto it.|
21531|When the  Moa wasn't looking, you quickly caught it with a rope.|
21532|You poured Antidote into Jonah's mouth. The bitter taste brought him, gagging, to consciousness.|
21533|You put the fumigator down on the ground, and tried to tear open the seal on the cap.|
21534|Tarnation. The Bugs have found you, and are moving towards you!|
21535|The Bugs are making terrifying cries. Why is this blasted pesticide still not working?|
21536|Just at that critical moment, the pesticide started emitting pungent smoke.|
21537|The Bugs in front of you started wailing, as the smoke touched them.|
21538|The Bugs couldn't stand the pesticide and finally left...|
21539|Seems like these Bugs are very aggressive. You have to be careful with them in the future.|
21540|After a long time of hard digging, a you uncovered a giant egg.|
21541|Even though I don't know what kind of egg this is, it must be what Akara is looking for.|
21542|The defeated Hunters built a simple temporary camp here.|
21543|A scream came from somewhere nearby. The Scavenger Bird King is flying towards you.|
21544|The Scavenger Bird King spotted you near the bait and started attacking you!|
21545|The Scavenger Bird King gave out a shrill, pitiful cry before dying. The other Scavenger Birds fled in panic.|
21546|After using the spell, your body started glowing and everything around you turned blurry.|
21547|You felt your consciousness being pulled out of your body by some weird force.|
21548|Both Luther and Rebecca are very happy to see Bobby finally regain consciousness.|
21549|You took the opportunity to tell Bobby what happened.|
21550|The Mine Foreman spotted some outsiders approaching. He raised his weapon immediately.|
21551|We are already behind schedule this week. Don't disturb our mining work!|
21552|Just as you were leaving, Hamilton gave you a peculiar Device.|
21553|This is a Teleport Device. It was originally made for fleeing after spying on a place.|
21554|When you use this after you've completed your Quest, you can come back here immediately.|
21555|Just as you and Wrenna are heading towards the Gatekeeper...|
21556|Wrenna: "I'll fly you directly to the center of the Ruins."|
21557|Wrenna flapped her wings and took you to the center of the Ruins.|
21558|After she lands, just follow the Blue Light on the ground to find the third seal.|
21559|Wrenna: "Just like before, I'm flying you directly to the center of the Ruins. Hold tight!"|
21560|This time, it's obvious to you that Wrenna has become much stronger.|
21561|After Endora died, the sorcery that protected the Seal of Water disappeared.|
21562|Wrenna: "Now you can attack the Seal of Water. Go smash it!"|
21563|After Shenoute was defeated, the Seal of Darkness lost its magical protection.|
21564|Wrenna: "The seal is so weak without is protection. Shatter this evil thing!"|
21565|The force behind Yakubu disappeared, and the Seal of Fire revealed itself.|
21566|Wrenna: "You must destroy the Seal of Fire!"|
21567|Wrenna: "Great! The Seal of Lightning is back on our plane."|
21568|Wrenna: "Now we are able to hit it. Do it!"|
21569|Saimini: "Don't move, invader!"|
21570|The red flowers exude a marvellous fragrance, making you relaxed and comfortable.|
21571|After the Flower of Life has absorbed the liquid in the bottle, it starts to give off a strange dust.|
21572|Use 'Hotkey 1' on the dragon egg to infuse it with life energy.|
21573|There were a lot of powerful mirages along the way. If it Akara hadn't been leading us, we would definitely have gotten lost in the Yellow Sand.|
21574|After going over mountains and valleys, we've finally arrived at the expedition team's camp. From the mess in the camp, it's easy to see how brutal the monsters were...|
21575|The Seal itself is shining intensely, triggered by some kind of mechanism.|
21576|Odum is a brave and skillful Makar warrior. He has the following skills: 
Mantle Splitter (Heavy strike that can stun)
Lacerator (Slash at multiple foes)
Furious Warcry (Weakens nearby targets)
Survival of the Fittest (Restores HP)|
21577|As long as you use these skills properly, you can defeat Silverflash Guards easily.|
21578|Silverflash Guards have set up several checkpoints on the road.|
21579|You have to defeat all the Guards on the road in order to see the Varan Priest.|
21580|You have already defeated the Guards here. Move on to the next checkpoint!|
21581|Use the Resistor on it. It's the only way to stop it!|
21582|I've already told you, there's something wrong with the energy here.|
21583|We better get out of this scary place, quickly.|
21584|You opened the box, and found a marked map inside.|
21585|You found an old letter in the jar, but the receiver's address is too old and smeared to read.|
21586|Maybe the Postman can help.|
21587|My treasure... My treasure is gone!|
21588|Suddenly silence fell...|
21589|Perry started to enjoy the crab meatballs.|
21590|Looks like something's caught in the fishnet. Open it and take a look!|
21591|This traveler excitedly ran towards Petunia's stall.|
21592|This should be asked to Petunia, but you avoided saying it out loud.|
21593|Been turned down, but he was very polite. If only everyone was so polite.|
21594|It's just a flyer. Why are you so resistant?|
21595|Good deal? Stop kidding me. When we've accumulated one hundred pieces in total, we can still distribute the flyers together.|
21596|He's also an adventurous traveler. Here's wishing that his path will be smooth.|
21597|This traveler looks lost and a little afraid. What he's thinking?|
21598|Rather than staying here and do nothing, you might as well go buy some more equipment...|
21599|The ridicule in his tone would be obvious to anyone.|
21600|Finally managed to get a response. You are quite happy about it, and your steps lighten.|
21601|You were so touched, you blessed him from deep within your heart, and wished him all the best.|
21602|You sensed there's something weird in that sentence...|
21603|After some deliberation you chose a secondary weapon, and Andre gave you a crash course in its use.

He may not be a fan of your choice, but Andre does seem mildly impressed in how quickly you mastered the basics.|
21604|Since you have recently experienced different battles with Eidolons, you have a solid foundation for your combat skills.|
21605|Under Andre's instruction, you learned the basics of your newly-chosen weapon quickly.|
21606|You saw a small, sneaky figure wandering around. You'd better check it out!|
21607|Andy is running away! Stop him, so you can get the Ruby Necklace back!|
21608|Andy says, "No no no! I'm not giving you the Necklace!"|
21609|Tatius says, "Ok, let's get ready."|
21610|Tatius says, "You there, soldier, open the cage door!"|
21611|Tatius says, "Good job!"|
21612|Tatius says, "Leave the rest to me. You go back and report to Team Leader Andre."|
21613|Just these few men? Hahahahaha, I'll definitely win!|
21614|Die! Die! Death is the best ending you can hope for!|
21615|Your last words... Have you thought about them?|
21616|The Giant on the left stopped attacking. Looks like he has lost the will to fight.|
21617|The Giant on the right stopped attacking. He seems to have already given up on winning.|
21618|The Giant in the middle put down his weapon and stopped walking. They have all surrendered!|
21619|Giants are attacking from the center!|
21620|Giants are attacking from the right!|
21621|Byron: "Hello, I'm Byron, a disciple of Analisa the Divine Blacksmith."|
21622|Byron: "Even though Analisa clearly knows that I'm most afraid of riding on animals, she asked me to be a tour guide. Why would she do that?!"|
21623|Byron: "Don't mind me, I'm just venting. Analisa actually takes very good care of me. I've learned so much from her."|
21624|Byron: "Here is the Stall Area... It is between the Central Round Square and the Trade District; a lot of traffic comes through here."|
21625|Byron: "Adventurers from all over the world prefer to set up their stalls in this area. Here, they can exchange their various wares among themselves."|
21626|Byron: "Ouch!"|
21627|Byron: "... Please be good, Ostrich. Can you run a little bit more steadily...?"|
21628|This is the hub that connects the Central Round Square and the Trade District. Adventurers love to set up their stalls here.|
21629|Byron: "Here is the Trade District. It's the main commercial area for the residents here. When you walk down this way, you can find the auctioneer, the banker and different food merchants."|
21630|Byron: "Hmm..."|
21631|Byron: "Ostrich, bro, you're such a live wire, but could you... Oh noooo! There's a hole there... ARGHHHHH...!!"|
21632|The Trade District is the main area for auctioneers, bankers and different food merchants.|
21633|Byron: "This high-rise structure is called the Sky Tower. There are many legends surrounding this Tower--it seems that there are various strong and terrifying monsters inside, or there are lots of magic weapons hidden inside... Maybe both."|
21634|Byron: "Some people even say that the top of the Tower is an entrance to Heaven. But ordinary residents are not allowed to enter, so no one can prove it. It's really very mysterious..."|
21635|Byron: "Hey!"|
21636|Byron: "Oh... Great. An even more active Ostrich and an even bumpier ride. This is really what I need, isn't it?"|
21637|The Sky Tower, full of legends and mysteries, is a forbidden place that no ordinary folks can trespass.|
21638|Byron: "Have you seen this grand and magnificent structure? This is the Castle Church."|
21639|Byron: "Castle Church is the residence of the incumbent Grand Bishop, Belenus. He also does his work in this place."|
21640|Byron: "Hmm... Why do you have a comfortable saddle and I don't? This isn't fair..."|
21641|Castle Church, the main administrative area in Navea. The Grand Bishop and other High Priests live here.|
21642|Byron: "We're now in the center of the Navea. A lot of merchants set up shop here."|
21643|Byron: "The merchants here sell various weapons, armor, groceries and secret stones."|
21644|Byron: "Ostrich, bro, you... Nevermind. I have no energy to complain anymore..."|
21645|Central Round Square is a gathering place for merchants of weapons, armors, groceries and secret stones.|
21646|Byron: "We're now in the military district. Um... don't be too loud. Team Leader Andre seems to be reviewing troops right now."|
21647|Byron: "Oh, he's standing in front of the hall, looking so majestic and solemn. That's Andre, the leader of the Templars."|
21648|Byron: "He's a very respected Templar. As long as he assumes personal command in Navea, all its citizens can live safely."|
21649|Byron: "Ahh... Ostrich, bro, it would be great if you could let me explain peacefully..."|
21650|The Military Hall has always protected Navea from harm.|
21651|Byron: "Oh, I'm going to throw up soon..."|
21652|Byron: "Indeed, I really envy adventurers like you. Now and then, I'd like to see the outside world, too."|
21653|Byron: "Analisa would never let me do it. She's always so worried about me, ha..."|
21654|Byron: "Hmm... About what I've just said, please don't get me wrong..."|
21655|Byron: "It's actually really great to be around Analisa. I've learned so much from her."|
21656|Byron: "Analisa may seem very direct and intimidating at times, but she's actually a very gentle person!"|
21657|Byron: "Will you come back often? If so, could you spare some time and visit Analisa and me?"|
21658|Byron: "Come and share your adventure stories with me. I think Analisa will love to see you, too!"|
21659|There are many people injured at this post. Many Hunters here have nearly lost their combat capability.|
21660|The temporary base of the Hunters' search and rescue team, now trying to find the Roger's missing units.|
21661|Front Line Guard Post. Soldiers here are monitoring the situation around Deep's Cavern, as ordered.|
21662|Hunters' Command Post for the operation against Stone Hammer Giants. The Hunting Band Leader and elite hunters are all stationed here.|
21663|The game bird struggled intensely as you put it into the bag.|
21664|At that moment, a powerful magic barrier appeared at the entrance of Deep's Cavern.|
21665|Such a strong magic spell can't be cast by just anyone.|
21666|All of a sudden, you felt a powerful familiarity...|
21667|This feeling seems to be the same as the Power of Gaia on you...|
21668|In a moment, you realized the feeling was coming from a girl not too far ahead of you.|
21669|Hunters' Mountain Village|
21670|New Moon Hunting Grounds|
21671|Beast Statue Altar|
21672|Argus Cult Church|
21673|Stone Hammer Tribe|
21674|Ancient Lair|
21675|Argus Hunter's cottage. Argus Village hunters gather here to handle the animals that they've caught.|
21676|Avians' residential area. Their daily necessities can be seen everywhere.|
21677|Agora in Argus Village. Elders and bigwigs of the Village reside in this high-class area.|
21678|Deep in Northern Forest|
21679|Weird. Ever since you got into the forest, you keep having the feeling that there's some invisible person watching you...|
21680|Suddenly, a powerful magic wrapped around your legs! This... you can't even move your fingertips...|
21681|Hmmph! This makes no sense!|
21682|Ever the hypocrite, Belenus.|
21683|In an instant, a dark shadow leaps forth, brandishing a baleful blade.|
21684|After that man appeared, a feeling of despair swept over the entire hall.|
21685|Discomfort and anxiety reigned over the throng. Those weaker in constitution have been fainting at an alarming rate.|
21686|The Grand Bishop chanted a prayer, and a holy light enveloped Gus and the nearby soldiers.|
21687|As he looked on, the Shadow Knight drew back his lips in a cold sneer.|
21688|As the Shadow Knight spoke, your heart sank into your chest and you closely observed the Grand Bishop's face.|
21689|You saw only serenity in the Grand Bishop's countenance as he waited for the Shadow Knight to finish speaking.|
21690|The Grand Bishop, his words tinged with anger and frustration, conjures a holy light to sear the demon.|
21691|The Grand Bishop raises his pitch, and a rare, slight expression of agitation played on his face.|
21692|The strange spell cast by the Shadow Knight made the crack in the abyss yawn even larger.|
21693|This time, a hulking mass of a creature stepped forth from the abyss.|
21694|You hear the sound of footsteps, and the door open as someone else enters the hall.|
21695|The Shadow Knight took a look at Andre, smiled contemptuously, and left through the door.|
21696|At this moment, Andre caught sight of you.|
21697|Andre says, "You! What are you waiting for? Help us!"|
21698|For the safety of Navea, defeat this monster with Andre!|
21699|The Infernal Demon suffered extreme pain, and prepared for one last counterattack before dying.|
21700|The Infernal Demon bellowed, his roar shaking the very walls of the hall.|
21701|The Infernal Demon cast a powerful shockwave at the Grand Bishop.|
21702|Grand Bishop! Watch out! Andre cried.|
21703|Without a second thought, you darted in front of the Grand Bishop, hoping to block the attack.|
21704|Vile monster! Taste holy steel! shouted Andre in vengeful anger.|
21705|The Power of the Light poured into Andre's sword. He raised the sword and, with all his might, slashed downward...|
21706|Finish off the Infernal Demon.|
21707|The colossal demon collapsed before the light. A hushed peace fell over the hall.|
21708|Alain opened the manuscript and checked its contents.|
21709|A Time Travel Device? I actually used to believe we could make something like that, when I was a kid.|
21710|The Flying Device, though... That looks like we might actually be able to build one.|
21711|Alain became more and more fascinated, completely indulged in his own world.|
21712|The silhouette of the ghost slowly disappeared, and vanishing front of your eyes.|
21713|You have the feeling that there's a weird gaze on you again! You stopped, looking around cautiously...|
21714|You watched around with sharp eyes, and then took your weapon in your hand!|
21715|What... What's happening? What's this sudden thunder?|
21716|Ahh... Such a strong spell! Blast it... Who the hell is this?|
21717|What kind of joke is this? I can't be captured just like that, without a fight!|
21718|You gasped a bit, then dared the ghost to bring it on.|
21719|Be careful! The ghost is going to attack you!|
21720|Though you wanted to keep chasing the ghost, right now you have to collect medicine for Roger as fast as you can.|
21721|Eidolon: "I think... the call is coming from the gigantic Blue Crystal."|
21722|After you hear what the Eidolon said, you slowly approach the Blue Crystal.|
21723|Suddenly, the Blue Crystal starts to make a loud, droning noise, absorbing energy at the same time.|
21724|An intense light appeared not too far off the ground, and a huge sound came from the sky.|
21725|Then huge creatures descended from the sky, one after another, to stand in front of you.|
21726|Each of these creatures exudes great power, and stares at you quietly...|
21727|The Blue Crystal's shining light starts fading away, as if it is waiting for you to connect with it.|
21728|You can only shoot the Bow and Arrow once. Try using it to hit both the targets at the same time!|
21729|You feel dizzy, and weak all over.|
21730|Sterling started to train the four Turtles.|
21731|I will definitely train them to stand on their own legs as a Turtle Beast.|
21732|However, before the training starts, I should name them first...|
21733|I'll name this one Nader... this one Darwin...|
21734|Sterling started to put serious effort into naming the Turtles.|
21735|You filled the bucket with the spring water from Sarpa Abyss.|
21736|Take the spring water to Penny.|
21737|You injected the antibody into the Unicorn, and it seemed to work.|
21738|The Unicorn didn't resist, and stayed by your side quietly.|
21739|You injected the antibody into the Unicorn, but it turned even more aggressive!|
21740|Let me show you my way of dealing with the Demon, after this.|
21741|Please close your eyes first.|
21742|Once you close your eyes, you feel Slick poking and prodding at you.|
21743|Great! It worked!|
21744|When the Demon sees you, it will be scared away.|
21745|I always scare others off with this trick. It never fails.|
21746|I'll dig the treasure up right away, and if there's anything good, I will definitely share with you.|
21747|Exedore dug quickly, revealing a trove of white pearls.|
21748|These are the pearls collected by the Sarpa! We're gonna be so rich!|
21749|Suddenly, a white pearl exploded. Lots of small bugs came from inside it.|
21750|I'll pack up this flower right away... Ouch!|
21751|Luke was accidentally stabbed by the flower, and the flower was stained with a bit of his blood.|
21752|Luke, I heard that you were looking for me?... What's in your hands?|
21753|Isn't... Isn't this a Marriage Flower!? I can't believe you went to the marsh and found it!|
21754|No... Actually, it's...|
21755|There is blood on it! You risked your life to get me this flower!|
21756|That's why this is...|
21757|Kurt started to set off for the Village. Quickly, keep up with him and protect him.|
21758|Wolfmen and their bats have appeared! Come and save me!|
21759|Here, we'll be safe. Thanks so much for your help!|
21760|After saying that, Kurt began to walk to Candetonn.|
21761|You put the bait on the designated spot.|
21762|Before long, a huge rhino came around.|
21763|You hoisted the Makar flag.|
21764|Oracle soldiers have shown up to destroy the flag! Protect it!|
21765|That's it! This is my Braided Rope! You really saved me!|
21766|The morale of the Makar has been significantly boosted by the flag!|
21767|The Priest has given you a blessing. You should visit all the altars!|
21768|You feel the strength of the rhino's soul.|
21769|You feel the strength of the wolf's soul.|
21770|You feel the strength of the hoofbeast's soul.|
21771|The Jerboa ate too much and couldn't move. You catch it easily and put it in the bag.|
21772|A female Makar suddenly came walking out.|
21773|I heard you have lost my Braided Rope?|
21774|No! Sweetheart, it's right here!|
21775|Nico hastily showed the female Makar the Braided Rope he just pinned on.|
21776|Hmmph! Glad it's not lost. I actually thought that you wanted to go against me.|
21777|I wouldn't dare! I love you, my dear, I've never ever thought of anything like that!|
21778|Ok then. If you really lose that Braided Rope, you'll be in trouble, I swear.|
21779|Yaluda let out a deafening roar into your ears.|
21780|You tied the exhausted rhino tightly with the Rope.|
21781|The rhino soon gave up struggling.|
21782|You set a fire to the rhino's tail. It ran off in pain and fear.|
21783|Shortly after that, sounds of startled and panicky Gnomes echoed out from Oracle Camp.|
21784|The wolf ate the drug-injected meat, and soon fell asleep on the ground.|
21785|You easily put the sleeping wolf into the bag.|
21786|To rescue the captive, you have to be disguised as the General's Assistant.|
21787|The Makar captive started to follow you.|
21788|You have to ensure the safety of the man with you, otherwise the General will blame me for not taking good care of the accused.|
21789|Great, you're safe!|
21790|So you are here to rescue me... Thank you so much.|
21791|Moloko salutes you, showing his gratitude.|
21792|A Sacred Power dashed at the Demon, and halted it in its tracks.|
21793|The quickest way to find out if there is a problem with the spring water is to conduct an experiment on humans.|
21794|Penny poured the spring water into the cup.|
21795|Alex, you've been so busy lately. Drink some water and take a break.|
21796|Thank you. I've always thought that you only cared about the research. I didn't realize that you can be this nice.|
21797|Alex gulped down the water.|
21798|Oh, my stomach doesn't feel so good.|
21799|Alex rolled on the floor in pain.|
21800|Hmm... Looks like there really is a problem with the spring water. I need to examine it carefully.|
21801|I'll never eat anything you bring me again...|
21802|After eating the waterweed, the Teenage Turtle fell into a deep sleep.|
21803|You cut the Shaggy Hoofbeast's Mane adeptly.|
21804|Munroe made the jerboa take the potion.|
21805|The jerboa's body suddenly became smaller!|
21806|The jerboa that has become smaller escaped from the gap of the cage and disappeared.|
21807|I didn't think about the possibility that it could be the kind of potion that can make the body smaller. I'm too careless.|
21808|Now I have to catch another jerboa.......|
21809|Violent splashes come from the pool, as if something huge and powerful is rising from the water!|
21810|Help move the Iron Armordillo Egg.|
21811|Capture the greedy Dizzy Thieving Rex.|
21812|Teach Ancient Panthera survival skills.|
21813|Help subdue the Giant Mountain Dragon.|
21814|Oww! That really, really hurts!|
21815|I feel much better now...|
21816|Hurry up with the cure! I wanna get up and fight!|
21817|Justice... shall... prevail...|
21818|Mhm... Looks like you've recovered quite well!|
21819|If you've been injured, try to rest! Or you'll take longer to recover.|
21820|Holy Light, reign down your healing power upon your followers! Cease their pain!|
21821|Vile monster!|
21822|Go to hell!|
21823|Kill!|
21824|Justice will triumph!|
21825|Feel the Holy Light, and be gone!|
21826|Go die! May you never have to repeat this path in your afterlife.|
21827|I'll never lose to a monster like you!|
21828|You're gonna pay for our dead brothers with your life!|
21829|Arrghhhh!|
21830|Curse...you...|
21831|Ha ha...Kill...|
21832|So...Ugly!|
21833|I'll... kill... you...|
21834|Rumble... Kill... Aah...|
21835|Oww! That really, really hurts!|
21836|Granny starts following behind you. Help her find her way home!|
21837|Now, are we heading left or right?|
21838|Ruth: I remember... There was a large, round square on my way here. Maybe I can remember more if we get there first.|
21839|I am sure I was here... But my memories before this are still a blur.|
21840|There is a fountain in the south. I seem to be very familiar with that area.|
21841|Right, it's here! I remember, this is the place I always come to.|
21842|Here comes an old man.|
21843|My wife! I finally found you!|
21844|You were just here resting... But all of a sudden you were gone! I've been worried sick!|
21845|I went to.... Where have I been? I can't remember it at all.|
21846|Don't worry. You are alright now, that's all that matters. Let's go home.|
21847|I can't believe you could actually find this place. Impressive!|
21848|Great. I'm so bored here. Finally it's over.|
21849|I don't wanna play it anymore either... I almost fell asleep.|
21850|Finally, it's over. I'm exhausted.|
21851|Don't play Hide and Seek next time. The city is way too big.|
21852|I agree.|
21853|Let's play other games.|
21854|You try it on this Wooden Dummy first.|
21855|You use the weapon in your hands to attack the Wooden Dummy.|
21856|Nice move, but you can try to hit it harder.|
21857|You try again to attack the Wooden Dummy.|
21858|Very good. Now use your full strength to attack the Wooden Dummy.|
21859|You've destroyed the Wooden Dummy!|
21860|...It seems that I have nothing more to teach you.|
21861|Laura's Bakery, in the Trading District. Newly opened!|
21862|Guaranteed delicious! If you miss it, you'll regret it!|
21863|A new bakery? I need to go have a try.|
21864|Laura's Bakery! The best bakery in the city!|
21865|Just go to the Trading District. You won't miss it!|
21866|A new bakery? As someone who loves cakes, I won't miss it!|
21867|Delicious cakes! In Laura's Bakery!|
21868|Special discount is offered if you buy the cake now!|
21869|Sounds pretty good! Let's go buy some, later.|
21870|When you light the match, an old woman suddenly appears next to you.|
21871|Are you my grandma!? You passed away a long time ago. I can't believe my eyes!|
21872|Wendy, it's time to go home for dinner.|
21873|Ok, grandma, let's go home.|
21874|Wendy left with her grandma.|
21875|The famous Sky Tower is over there. It's said that the tower has been there for a very long time.|
21876|In the south, the main gate of Navea. The gate leads to Crescent Hill.|
21877|Next to it is the Central Round Square. People can buy weapons, armor, Secret Stones and all the other essential items for adventurers there.|
21878|Heh heh...hey there, girlie! Why don't you come have some fun with me.|
21879|S-stay away! Don't come any closer or I'll scream!|
21880|Hahaha. Scream your lungs out, cutie. No one's gonna swing in and save you.|
21881|Heeeeeeeelp!|
21882|That girl is being harassed by a drunkard. Hurry and save her!|
21883|You gave the drunkard a sound thrashing and drove him off.|
21884|Thank you so much. If you hadn't shown up, I don't know what would've happened.|
21885|The girl smiles and waves as she leaves.|
21886|You lift the Fishing Rod and start fishing by the lake.|
21887|You feel like you caught something.|
21888|After you pulled the fishing rod, you find out you've caught a small cloth bag.|
21889|Great! That's my money bag that fell in the lake!|
21890|Taz puts the Cloth Bag in his pocket immediately.|
21891|Thank you! Now I gotta go now. Bye.|
21892|Everybody, pull yourself together!|
21893|It's a tough road ahead of us, but we have Andre leading us. We shall overcome all difficulties!|
21894|Right!|
21895|Death to The Shadow Knight!|
21896|Everlasting Light!|
21897|Stall Area|
21898|Trade District|
21899|Sky Tower|
21900|Castle Church|
21901|Central Round Square|
21902|The Military Hall|
21903|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill, "Calm Waters."|
21904|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill, "Breath of Darkness."|
21905|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill "Fire of Life."|
21906|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill, "Temporal Phase."|
21907|After you arrived, you noticed the giant Blue Crystal on the altar that you are familiar with.|
21908|When you approach it, the Blue Crystal starts shining, as if it's responding to you.|
21909|After that, all kinds of energy gather slowly in the sky. There are shining beams of light all around.|
21910|The Eidolons that appear in front of you are much more powerful than the previous ones. They gaze at you quietly.|
21911|The Blue Crystal's shining light starts fading away, as if it is waiting for you to connect to it.|
21912|The Grand Chief of the Mistwalker Tribe has deployed a large number of troops. The whole temple is now heavily guarded.|
21913|We still have to stop them from destroying the temple's seal, no matter what it takes!|
21914|The Grand Tribal Chief himself is standing on the platform in front!|
21915|Odum: "Warriors, guard the gate! No one must get in to disrupt me!"|
21916|Odum: "No...No! I want that power! Give it to me, now!"|
21917|Odum: "Enough... I... I surrender... I surrender to your power..."|
21918|The temple starts shaking from its foundations. It seems that the Seal will soon be broken.|
21919|The temple shakes again. In the blink of an eye, the Seal Stone of Alabastern Temple crashes into the ground!|
21920|The light of the Sealed Stone is now completely gone, but the deafening roar still echoes inside the temple.|
21921|A giant monster appears from the smoke and haze in front of you!|
21922|I'm back... I can't believe those ingrates sealed me away!|
21923|Now... The whole world is gonna pay!|
21924|Odum: "Young man, let me, Odum Ryan, help you!"|
21925|Odum waves the Gigantic Axe in his hands and charges the giant monster from behind!|
21926|Huh... huh... I finally caught up with you... This place... This place is amazing!|
21927|Bring it on! I will show you what I, the Grand Tribal Chief, am capable of!|
21928|After you passed through the Candeo Core, a vast valley opened up in front of you.|
21929|The Water Purifier you set up earlier is floating quietly on the side...|
21930|Noripan: "You are not allowed to enter... You have to die!"|
21931|Fia: "Intruder, leave. You can't come in here!"|
21932|Fia: "It seems that our warnings have been ignored... Noripan! Don't let him pass through."|
21933|Augustus: "Hey! Wait for me. I rushed here as soon as I heard the news!"|
21934|You hear Augustus' hasty footsteps coming from behind.|
21935|Security Alarm: "Invaders! Red Alert! Red Alert!"|
21936|Security Alarm: "All citizens, take shelter immediately. All Policebots, converge on target!"|
21937|Odum: "No! You greedy human... Give my strength back!"|
21938|Odum: "I'm gonna kill you...Kill you!"|
21939|I've done what I am supposed to do. This is the only way I can leave here without shame.|
21940|Now you get outta here as fast as you can. By the way... Tell people in Lunarin that I'm sorry.|
21941|Kayel the Protector: "Protection Order Executed. Block pathway to ensure public safety..."|
21942|Kayel the Protector: "Pathway confirmed blocked. Start searching for intruders..."|
21943|Kayel the Protector: "Intruder found! Execute final warning."|
21944|Kayel the Protector: "This is the final warning. Leave! Or you will be forced to leave."|
21945|Fia: "Enough! I've lost the last of my patience!"|
21946|Kayel threw out an incendiary bomb. The bomb exploded among the fallen trees.|
21947|The trees are burning in the raging flames...|
21948|Fia: "You broke into our territory, ignored my warnings..."|
21949|As a way to repay you for saving its life, the Recovered Wolf has decided to follow you.|
21950|A giant turtle is walking here, slowly.|
21951|It must be the Turtles' leader. Go defeat it!|
21952|Show the human our true power!|
21953|Defeat this human!|
21954|I can't believe our leader was defeated by a human! We gotta report this to the queen!|
21955|Our leader has been defeated. Run!|
21956|Go tell Anya what you learned from the Village Chief!|
21957|The minute you set foot in this place, you had a strange feeling about the cave.|
21958|You've noticed that all the living creatures in this Candeo Core have evolved to a state that is more powerful than you could have imagined.|
21959|Now all you can think of is to join Alex, and close the water gate as soon as possible, to prevent the disaster from getting even worse.|
21960|You look around, and notice that something is wrong. Go to the red arrow and check.|
21961|You can see some marks on the ground, but they are not very clear. Go on to the next spot and have a look.|
21962|They seem to be footprints, but it's hard to tell which kind of creature they belong to. Go on to the next spot and have a look.|
21963|The marks here are very clear. They were made by a human. Alex must have been here.|
21964|At this moment you notice that there are a set of footprints heading to the opposite direction. It looks like Alex has left.|
21965|Follow these footprints, and you should be able to find Alex.|
21966|Abyss Patroller: "I smell something annoying..."|
21967|Abyss Patroller: I smell something annoying...|
21968|Abyss Patroller: "The queen has said that, except for that guy, no human is welcome here!"|
21969|Abyss Patroller: The queen has said that, except for that guy, no human is welcome here!|
21970|Abyss Patroller: "So... Go to hell!"|
21971|Abyss Patroller: So... Go to hell!|
21972|Alex: "Hey! I'm here!"|
21973|You're good to go! Draw the Sarpa's attention to you, so that Alex can finish his mission.|
21974|Sarpa Queen: "A Human... I've just chased away one, who would've thought another would come?"|
21975|Sarpa Queen: A Human... I've just chased away one, who would've thought another would come?|
21976|At this point, you hear faint, melodious music.|
21977|You have a very weird feeling, because the music seems to be coming from your own head.|
21978|You begin to wonder just how powerful the Sarpa Queen might have become in this cave.|
21979|Alex is ready to detonate the dynamite, as soon as the Sarpa Queen falls.|
21980|Alex: "The timing is perfect! I'm detonating the dynamite, so watch out!"|
21981|The timing is perfect! I'm detonating the dynamite, so watch out!|
21982|The dynamite exploded, blocking the flow of water here.|
21983|Just when everything was peaceful again, a powerful force swept through the Candeo Core!|
21984|The Shadow Knight glanced at you. You can't read his eyes.|
21985|Haha! Not a smart move! Did you really expect to catch us off guard!?|
21986|Don't fight it. Just let these Arachnids eat you all!|
21987|After saying that, the Sarpa Leader and her crew headed into the Sarpa Abyss.|
21988|The poisoned soldiers are being attacked by the Arachnids. Go defeat the bugs, and rescue the soldiers!|
21989|After defeating all of the Arachnids, you helped the poisoned soldiers return to the village for treatment.|
21990|You can't leave yet! Defeat the Arachnids and rescue the trapped soldiers!|
21991|Fia: "Now you will never leave here... ever!"|
21992|The path ahead is completely blocked. Looks like you'll have to turn back.|
21993|Qulun: "Brothers, we have the people from the church surrounded!"|
21994|Qulun: "Let's make the final moments of their lives as painful as possible."|
21995|Qulun: "Ha! Couldn't handle me on your own? Bring whatever help you want; I'll cut you all down!"|
21996|Ha! Couldn't handle me on your own? Bring whatever help you want; I'll cut you all down!|
21997|The strange eggs lining the room have begun quivering and cracking. This can't be good.|
21998|I was curious who was chasing me, but I wasn't expecting it to be just a kid.|
21999|You think you can stop me all by yourself? Don't make me laugh!|
22000|Don't underestimate the power held in my Archaic Tome!|
22001|I call for your aid, Lord of the Otherworld! Titanus!|
22002|Titanus! Destroy him!|
22003|Maggie! You're under arrest for murder, espionage, and treason!|
22004|Hah! Hypocrites.|
22005|Take her to Navea. Let her stand trial.|
22006|Yes!|
22007|There is an unsettling hissing sound coming from afar. It sounds like a gigantic insect.|
22008|Up ahead, someone is running away.|
22009|It's Maggie! We need to get rid of these monsters quickly so we can catch up to her!|
22010|Who's there, Maggie called as she stopped running.|
22011|The Magic Circle vanished, and in its place stood a gigantic and horrifying creature!|
22012|Vic...Victoria! No...|
22013|Adjutant, read the charges against her.|
22014|I never imagined the traitor could be within the Ministry itself...|
22015|Adjutant, let's get out of here.|
22016|Hey!|
22017|You hear Maggie screaming.|
22018|Alex: "Good work! Keep drawing her attention!"|
22019|Good work! Keep drawing her attention!|
22020|Alex: "I gotta make it work this time..."|
22021|I gotta make it work this time...|
22022|Alex: "Just a bit longer! I'm almost ready to detonate the device!"|
22023|Just a bit longer! I'm almost ready to detonate the device!|
22024|Sarpa Queen: "Such a rude little intruder. Did you think I wouldn't notice you?"|
22025|Such a rude little intruder. Did you think I wouldn't notice you?|
22026|Sarpa Queen: "I can sense everything that happens in these waters."|
22027|Sarpa Queen: I can sense everything that happens in these waters.|
22028|Sarpa Queen: "Don't think for a moment that you can get away with harming my people."|
22029|Sarpa Queen: Don't think for a moment that you can get away with harming my people.|
22030|Sarpa Queen: "You've got guts, busting in here and stirring up trouble. Now it's time for you to pay."|
22031|Sarpa Queen: You've got guts, busting in here and stirring up trouble. Now it's time for you to pay.|
22032|Sarpa Queen: "There are severe consequences for angering me. I will make you regret ever coming here."|
22033|There are severe consequences for angering me. I will make you regret ever coming here.|

22068|You've captured <Soul Taker> Tania! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Edmund, the Sanknie Guard.|
22069|You've captured <Reaper> Grim! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Edmund, the Sanknie Guard.|
22070|The Shadow Knight has left, and the sense of overwhelming pressure is gone.|
22071|The giant shell nearby seems unnatural. You may want to be vigilant.|
22072|The bizarre plant in the bushes nearby is giving off a weird smell. You may want to be vigilant.|
22073|There seems to be something staring at you from the bushes, not far away. You may want to be vigilant.|
22074|Standing among the flowers nearby is one unusually large flower. You may want to be vigilant.|
22075|There's a weird mound of woodblocks and other stuff nearby. You may want to be vigilant.|
22076|The bright flower not far away seems demonic. You may want to be vigilant.|
22077|That stinky flower bud seems abnormal. You may want to be vigilant.|
22078|The egg sac in the bushes seems weird. You may want to be vigilant.|
22079|Suddenly, the earth started shaking as a powerful force intruded on this sacred land!|
22080|Dragon Outsider: "Arrghhhh!!!"|
22081|Aelius: "T'was rash of you to set foot upon this soil, fiend."|
22082|A loud voice resounds as the Knight of the Sun steps forth, ready to challenge the fiend.|
22083|Aelius: "Tsch...it seems this fiend has reserves of power I did not anticipate...."|
22084|Sigrun: "Hang in there! We've got your back."|
22085|Two more powerful spirits have joined the fray!|
22086|Yarnaros: "It takes a monster to best a monster, and now, you've met your match."|
22087|Sigrun: "Grr...this one's not going to go quietly into the night..."|
22088|Aelius: "Perhaps we ought combine our might!"|
22089|Yarnaros: "Now you're speakin' my language!"|
22090|Using their divine power, the three Eidolons subdued the Dragon Outsider and sent it back to the Otherworld.|
22091|Aelius: "Many thanks for your help!"|
22092|Yarnaros: "Much obliged. I'll catch you on the flip side."|
22093|Sigrun: "Farewell!"|
22094|Farewell, old friends! We shall fight together again another day!|
22095|The forces have dispersed and the monster has been defeated. Peace has returned to the sacred land.|
22096|Para Ryan: "It can't be delayed any longer. We gotta restore the seal as fast as we can!"|
22097|It can't be delayed any longer. We gotta restore the seal as fast as we can!|
22098|The Second Prince, Para Ryan, can't wait any more and rushes into the temple all by himself.|
22099|But because the seal is broken, Wrathborne Temple has been occupied by monsters.|
22100|In front of you is the Temporal Golem, one of the Protectors of the temple.|
22101|Temporal Golem: "Destruction comes along with my hands... Flames of war come along with my footsteps..."|
22102|Destructions come along with my hands... Flames of war come along with my footsteps...|
22103|Temporal Golem: "I am gonna destroy it all!"|
22104|Temporal Golem: I am gonna destroy it all!|
22105|Para Ryan: "Hmm? It's the Holy Unicorn from the temple..."|
22106|Para Ryan: Hmm? It's the Holy Unicorn from the temple...|
22107|At this moment, you hear the Second Prince roaring from afar. Apparently, he is fighting monsters.|
22108|Your arrival has triggered some mechanism. The light from a Long Distance Beacons falls around you.|
22109|You are just in time! Help me knock it down!|
22110|The Steed fell to the ground. Its eyes calmed, and slowly lost their shine.|
22111|Second Prince took the orb out of his robe, planning to use it to restore the temple's seal.|
22112|The orb's power is circling, directing the surrounding energy to gather in the center.|
22113|The seal is restored! It's complete and full of energy. You've done it!|
22114|It seems unusually quiet. Just when you had started becoming uneasy at the quiet, several enemies appeared and restrained you.|
22115|They look like Disciples of Light... But they are giving off an ominous air. They have been corrupted by a dark force.|
22116|You have been restrained by an evil force, preventing you from moving. However, you feel your own strength begin to build up deep inside of you...|
22117|Suddenly, a great force burst out from you, breaking the restraints!|
22118|You can feel power swirling around inside of you, ready to burst out at a moment's notice.|
22119|The foul air is dispersing, making way for a pure and divine energy.|
22120|The Wrathborne Soul turns to you with a smile and a look of approval.|
22121|How... How this possible? I can't believe that the Lord of the Otherworld would...|
22122|Go!|
22123|Hmph! Don't be so cocky, Victoria.|
22124|You should get out of this place as soon as you can; monsters are already on their way here.|
22125|Robinson: "Onward! Everyone Advance!"|
22126|Robinson's troops are trying to break through the Avian's defenses to get further into the cave.|
22127|Zaunna: "No one is allowed through while our God is regaining his strength!"|
22128|Zaunna: "He's come through? ... You two, go deal with him!"|
22129|Useless imbeciles! It seems I will have to deal with you myself.|
22130|Watch out! The eggs are emitting a toxic gas.|
22131|The Brooders heard you approaching and have retreated underground.|
22132|Suddenly a bunch of panicked larvae sprung up from out of the ground!|
22133|With a cloud of dust, a giant insect came bursting up from out of the ground!|
22134|Maya: "I knew you wouldn't let me down. Well done!"|
22135|Let's see... Zaunna would have brought that treasure here.|
22136|Maya took something from the treasure chest and cradled it in her arms.|
22137|Hahaha... It's here! I've been searching for it for so long...|
22138|What's with that rumbling? Why is the ground shaking? Are those footsteps?|
22139|You can feel a warm wind blowing towards you. There is a cliff in front of you!|
22140|Everything is shaking violently. A huge monster has climbed up the face of the cliff!|
22141|The Water Purifier you set up earlier is floating quietly...|
22142|The land is full of peaceful nature, but you sense an uneasiness in the air...|
22143|A gentle breeze comes up, comforting you with cool and refreshing air.|
22144|But even this is not enough to settle your nervousness upon entering the land of the Makar tribe.|
22145|The Makar greet you with arrogant and unwelcoming glares.|
22146|It is obvious in their demeanor that most Makar despise humans.|
22147|You remain steadfast despite the suspicious looks, and continue making your way to the residence of the Makar King.|
22148|Shalen: "Hold on a second." It appears a female Makar wants to speak with you.|
22149|Shalen: "How did it go?"|
22150|It's a surprise to meet you here. Then again, perhaps not. Perhaps it is the hand of fate that has brought us together.|
22151|I have been busy with my special training. Allow me to demonstrate just how strong I have become.|
22152|Helakar attacked you immediately after he finished speaking.|
22153|There seems to be something buried underneath the dune.|
22154|By carefully digging, you reveal a dragon egg.|
22155|The question continues to bother you while traveling to meet Merle.|
22156|I need to pick some Dragon Bell Grass. I need you to protect me.|
22157|Stay close! I'm afraid there will be lots of dangers along the way.|
22158|Dragon Bell Grass is rare, but I'm hopeful we will find some.|
22159|There is some! Pick it, and lets continue looking.|
22160|Another one! Be quick, it's not safe here!|
22161|I think this is all we can hope to get this time.|
22162|Let's keep going.|
22163|Let's head back.|
22164|Para Ryan: "How dare you defile the temple! I will destroy you!"|
22165|Para Ryan: How dare you defile the temple! I will destroy you!|
22166|Para Ryan: "Once the seal is restored, you all are getting locked up!"|
22167|Para Ryan: Once the seal is restored, you all are getting locked up!|
22168|The scent of blood overwhelms you the moment you set foot inside the cave.|
22169|You must find and destroy the terrible force inside to prevent the Oblitus Wood from withering.|
22170|Something strange is going on up ahead. Go check it out!|
22171|A giant lizard is devouring the remains of a Stray Butterfly Fairy that wandered in here by mistake.|
22172|The Ghostweep Chameleon has noticed your presence. He still seems to be hungry...|
22173|Ghostweep Chameleon: "Ssss..."|
22174|A few Butterfly Fairy Survivors managed to escape from the bowels of the Ghostweep Chameleon.|
22175|The Butterfly Fairy Survivors gave you their blessings. You can feel a refreshing aura enveloping you.|
22176|You sense a foul air all around you. There must be a powerful enemy nearby.|
22177|Tafay Chief: "I'm here... behind the bushes!"|
22178|Tafay Chief: I'm here... behind the bushes!|
22179|The Ghostweep Ruins fill with an evil aura as the Duke of the Beyond appears.|
22180|Duke of the Beyond: "Hah! Intruders!"|
22181|As the Duke of the Beyond stepped to the center of the hall, all of the energy in the air condensed into him.|
22182|Odum Ryan: "Let me help you!"|
22183|Odum Ryan: Let me help you!|
22184|Duke of the Beyond: "Ah, you've brought a friend. Excellent! This ought to be fun!"|
22185|Duke of the Beyond: Ah, you've brought a friend. Excellent! This ought to be fun!|
22186|Duke of the Beyond: "It would be a shame to send you to the afterlife alone. The two of you can keep each other company."|
22187|Duke of the Beyond: It would be a shame to send you to the afterlife alone. The two of you can keep each other company.|
22188|As the Duke of the Beyond collapsed, the whole of the Ghostweep Ruins began to shake.|
22189|Footsteps can be heard all around as the hall fills with people.|
22190|Butterfly Fairy: "Thank you, human. We would certainly be dead if not for your aid."|
22191|Butterfly Fairy: "Please accept our blessings. May the Spirit of Nature guide you."|
22192|With the temple sealed for so long, the creatures inside have evolved far differently than those outside.|
22193|Be careful around the Holy Beetle Eggs. They are putting off a strange toxic gas.|
22194|Up ahead, you catch a glimpse of two shadowy figures as they ran into the room on the left.|
22195|Your attention is drawn by approaching footsteps. Omar has arrived with his Expedition Team.|
22196|Suddenly, the two shadows reappeared. It's an ambush! Everything goes dark...|
22197|When everyone came to, they noticed that the Sand Gem was gone!|
22198|Quick! You need to catch up to Caroline before it's too late!|
22199|Suddenly there is a severe earthquake. Could it be that the gem's power has been released?|
22200|Helakar: "Ah! Ha ha ha! Such wonderful power!"|
22201|By unleashing the Sand Gem, Caroline has made her Eidolon incredibly powerful.|
22202|Helakar is overflowing with powerful energy. He appears completely manic.|
22203|Akara: "We're too late!"|
22204|Talamund: "No! This can't be! I was supposed to be immortal..."|
22205|As thanks for your aid, the Recovered Wolf has decided to join you.|
22206|The Second Prince might not be able to deal with all these monsters by himself. You should catch up to him and keep him from getting in over his head.|
22207|Today, he gave up on justice. Defeat him and put him out of his misery.|
22208|The Second Prince was careless, and got himself caught in a trap.|
22209|The road is littered with the bodies of monsters. It appears that they were defeated by the Second Prince.|
22210|Para Ryan: "Aaaaaaah! You attacked me!"|
22211|Para Ryan: Aaaaaaah! You attacked me!|
22212|Para Ryan: "Hey! I'm not the enemy!"|
22213|Para Ryan: Hey! I'm not the enemy!|
22214|You hear the sounds of heavy fighting. The Second Prince is near!|
22215|The Second Prince is fighting the frenzied beast up front. Go help him defeat it!|
22216|Soon you will be gone from this earth! Let the cursed fires of hell feed on your sadness!|
22217|Nudak Fortress|
22218|Fulcheth Forest|
22219|Krok Village|
22220|Barren Well|
22221|Forest of Thorns|
22222|Tafay Village|
22223|Ghostweep Ruins|
22224|Aside from emitting a low humming sound, the seal doesn't seem special in any way.|
22225|The zombies are performing some kind of ritual. A strange and unsettling energy is filling the air.|
22226|Their bodies start to twist and change. You get the feeling that something bad is about to happen.|
22227|With a burst of light, the zombies evolved. They have become far more powerful... and far more ugly!|
22228|Even though you have destroyed the Ghostweep Ruins Magic Source, you feel that the Ruins is not yet safe.|
22229|The Grand Mistwalker Elder has brought his clan to the hall.|
22230|Fia: "My kind warnings meant nothing to you?"|
22231|Noripan: "This is as far as you can go... Human..."|
22232|Security Alarm: "The City Square has been taken. All citizens, please take refuge in the temple."|
22233|Security Alarm: "The whole city will be under martial law. Repeat. The whole city will be under martial law."|
22234|Kayel the Protector: "All pathways in the temple will be blocked."|
22235|Kayel the Protector: "Pathway blocking confirmed. Switching to Annihilation mode."|
22236|Kayel the Protector: "All creatures outside the temple will be destroyed."|
22237|Kayel the Protector: "Annihilation mode activated. All creatures will be destroyed."|
22238|The Marauder Miners are mining the spar greedily. The sound is echoing in the dark Mine Pit...|
22239|Qulun: "Pull yourself together! Don't let the work be disrupted!"|
22240|Qulun: "Just bring it on... My blade will slash you in half!"|
22241|The deeper inside the mine... The denser the ferocious creatures are...|
22242|The zombies in front are performing an evil Blood Sacrifice...|
22243|It gives people terrible feelings...|
22244|A low, roaring sound is coming from the deep side of the cave.|
22245|The Argus Cult has strengthened their defenses. There are well - equipped guards everywhere.|
22246|Zaunna: "Guard the passage for me. No one is to pass!"|
22247|Zaunna: "Stop them now! It's an order!"|
22248|With the Secret Order in hand, you sought out the tent belonging to leader of the pirates.

However, when you tried to enter the tent, you were stopped by a Catseye Herald.|
22249|After you talked to him and showed him the Secret Order, the Cat's Eye Herald finally agreed to set up a meeting  with the Pirate Leader.|
22250|You asked the pirates, straightforwardly, where Selena was.|
22251|Adjutant Follower: "Oh... You are here looking for that girl... She was brought to our headquarters. Hahaha."|
22252|Adjutant Follower: "As for you... I'm not in the mood to deal with you. Now get the hell outta here!"|
22253|Caroline: "Hahaha! Stupid guys. Thanks for helping me find the Gem. I didn't even have to do too much!"|
22254|Caroline appeared ahead, briefly. Go catch up with her!|
22255|Helakar ignored Caroline's calling, and attacked you on his own.|
22256|Helakar was defeated, and the spiritual power faded. Caroline's Guiding Spell was reversed.|
22257|Both Helakar's and the Sand Gem's power rushed back to Caroline.|
22258|Caroline couldn't handle these two powerful forces. There was an explosion, and all that was left of her was ashes.|
22259|Talamund: "I, have awoken from a long, long sleep with all my immortal strength."|
22260|Talamund: "It's good to have you here to witness my return. Especially you..."|
22261|Talamund: "Wrenna...The Dragon of Salvation in the prophecy, my nemesis."|
22262|Talamund: "Let's face our fate together..."|
22263|Talamund: "I, Talamund, will sever this annoying fetter once and for all!"|
22264|After entering the room, you witnessed the Chief Guardian kill the man you just saw.|
22265|You notice that these creatures are rattled. Apparently, someone entered earlier and spooked them.|
22266|The damage on this cart seem pretty new. Looks like someone is trying to take something out of here.|
22267|You've got the information you need, so...|
22268|It's bad news, but still, Madeline must know about this...|
22269|From now on, you have to be Haas's guard. Try to keep him from getting hurt.|
22270|There's no need to come here again... Just leave this place.|
22271|Joshua's Reservation|
22272|Joshua's Reservation|
22273|Suddenly, you feel an overwhelming pressure upon you.|
22274|The Miracle Rock Monster has exploded into pieces. Pick up the fragments, now!|
22275|The fairy flies away, crying.|
22276|You made a note of the distinguishing features of the Demarech Mine District.|
22277|You made a note of the distinguishing features of Caerment Altar.|
22278|This place has lost its sacred power. Without the seal, the temple now can no longer restrain the monsters.|
22279|This place has turned into a monsters' haunt. The sense of sacredness the temple once had is now gone.|
22280|The bodies of dead monsters and fallen guardians are evidence of a fierce battle here.|
22281|Numerous Disciples of Light have been killed by the influence of demonic force, some even have been corrupted, and turned into demons themselves.|
22282|Breaking in has triggered the temple's defenses. Several Columns of Light have appeared around you.|
22283|The Columns of Light are gathering energy. You feel that they might be summoning some sort of creature.|
22284|The light faded, revealing a Holy Unicorn. However, it seems to have been corrupted by the demonic air in the temple, as it's expression is violent and frantic.|
22285|It doesn't deserve such a tortured fate. Best to put an end to its suffering.|
22286|You see a group of Disciples of Light up ahead. They seem to be arguing with one another.|
22287|When you finally reached the peak of the temple, you noticed a commotion being made by a group of Disciples of Light.|
22288|As the argument grew to a fever pitch, one of the Disciples lashed out and killed the others.|
22289|With the rest of them gone, the remaining Disciple of Light emits a staggering energy. The demonic air disappears, and the temple becomes tranquil.|
22290|Frederic: "Oh? It appears I have an audience. Come out, let me see you."|
22291|Frederic: "You really shouldn't struggle. You look so... ugly... when you struggle!"|
22292|Frederic: "I could just kill you outright, but where is the fun in that?"|
22293|Frederic: "I'll give you one chance to fight for your life. Make good use of it!"|
22294|You see some crystal fragments along the road. They still have a tiny bit of their energy remaining.|
22295|The energy seems to have come from an Eidolon that is in the process of transforming.|
22296|Sand Owl Elite: "Look out! We need to protect Captain Helakar!"|
22297|Look out! We need to protect Captain Helakar!|
22298|Aah... Such power...|
22299|You can do nothing but watch as Helakar transforms.|
22300|The energy swirling around Helakar has reached critical mass. It collapses on Helakar and dissipates, revealing him transformed into a new form.|
22301|I am glad you are all here. You can now witness my newfound strength!|
22302|As Helakar crumpled to the ground, the energy that had transformed him started to escape. He reverted back into his original form, but energy continued to pour out of him and he collapsed.|
22303|Chief Guardian Murfeo is stationed here. He has sworn that he will not let anyone pass.|
22304|Talamund: "I, the Immortal Talamund, have awoken from a long, deep sleep."|
22305|Talamund: "This world may have changed while I was sleeping..."|
22306|Talamund: "But you humans remain as pitiful as ever."|
22307|Talamund: "That you were able to make it here changes nothing."|
22308|Talamund: "Now, face your inevitable death. That is your punishment for coming here without my permission!"|
22309|Helakar is up ahead. It seems likely that all this foul energy came from him.|
22310|FFCG01.ogv|
22311|Finally! I've found the last silver coin. Now I can lift this wretched curse!|
22312|Now that I have been freed from these shackles, I can enact my revenge on this world!|
22313|Wait! Who is that behind you?|
22314|I suspected that there was a spy among us. That is why I set this trap.|
22315|Today is the day you die!|
22316|The Sneaky Villager waved when he saw you approaching.|
22317|You've caught a Forest Beetle! Now you can go back to Bella's Orchard and challenge Donny.|
22318|You've done a lot of promotion in many places! You should visit Laura and see if it has worked.|
22319|Only three minutes left! You must deliver the goods before time runs out.|
22320|Time is up! You failed to deliver the goods before the deadline.|
22321|This is the Residential Neighborhood. They say the residents here are the happiest people in the world.|
22322|The Bank of Navea is up ahead. You can tell how well business is by the number of people out in front.|
22323|To the south is the main gate of Navea. Going through there will take you to Cresent Hill.|
22324|This is the Residential Neighborhood. They say the residents here are the happiest people in the world.|

22350|I remember there being a square with a big fountain near my home. There was also a tall gate nearby.|
22351|Rose: This isn't it. I have never been here before.|
22352|You have found all of the children. You should give this news to Mick.|
22353|You have strayed too far from the Anemometer, and it has been destroyed by monsters.|
22354|This suit of armor may be old, but it is the right size. I only need to make a few alterations...|
22355|Reboot complete. Several functions cannot be restored. Booting into Safe Mode.|
22356|I can't just take off by myself. I need to wait for Potter.|
22357|Halton: I can't just take off by myself. I need to wait for Potter.|
22358|We haven't retrieved everything yet. I can't leave like this.|
22359|Halton: We haven't retrieved everything yet. I can't leave like this.|
22360|You've found Allen. Tell him that Mick has given up.|
22361|You've found Leah. Tell her that Mick has given up.|
22362|You've found Kate. Tell her that Mick has given up.|
22363|You go find the others. I'll join you guys later.|
22364|I waited for so long, and all I got is the news that he's gone...|
22365|I have no regrets. At least now I know he always loved me.|
22366|Your beetle looks pretty good, but mine's still better.|
22367|Come on out, beetle!|
22368|Donny's beetle slowly climbed out.|
22369|You've caught a big one! Isaac the Fisherman will want to take a look at this.|
22370|This... This reminds me of Silverash Shores.|
22371|This is incredible! It makes me feel like I'm really at Silverash Shores.|
22372|You have finished repairing the fence.|
22373|Drew took a small pillow out of the package.|
22374|My pillow! I can't sleep well without it.|
22375|Drew happily clutches his pillow.|
22376|Help is finally coming! Let's be ready to get out of here!|
22377|Yes!|
22378|Aye!|
22379|A giant robot has appeared in front of you.|
22380|Unidentified Targets! Switching to "Elimination" Mode!|
22381|I'll deal with this robot. You all go on ahead!|
22382|We can't just leave you alone!|
22383|We're a team!|
22384|Ah, thank you. Let's deal with it together, then.|
22385|Yes! We've beaten it!|
22386|Thanks! Because of your help, we were able to retreat.|
22387|We are on our way back to report to the General. I hope we meet again someday!|
22388|Heinrich and his men left.|
22389|You absorbed energy from the Ballistic Butterfly Hoplite with the Energy Collector.|
22390|The Energy Collector is full. You should bring it to Mulrooney in Tafay Village.|
22391|I'm surprised it went this well. I'll see if it works right now.|
22392|Mulrooney emptied the contents of the Energy Collector in to his machine and started it|
22393|The machine buzzed and whirred to life.|
22394|It's doing something, but it sounds a bit odd...|
22395|With a shudder and a thunk, the machine crashed to a halt. Black smoke began to billow out of it.|
22396|Wonderful. Looks like it won't work after all. I need to think of another way...|
22397|I'm saved! I've been going crazy!|
22398|Lamarr put on the hat.|
22399|This is so much better! This really cuts down on the glare and the noise!|
22400|Thank you. Now I can treat these people.|
22401|Perrin ground the herbs with a mortar and pestle, then fed them to the Poisoned Militiaman.|
22402|Wha- What happened to me?|
22403|The Wounded Militiaman regained consciousness.|
22404|It worked! Thank you so much! This will allow us to treat a lot of people.|
22405|You notice a human kid talking to a Varan.|
22406|Why do you have all of those scales?|
22407|The Varan doesn't reply.|
22408|Can I be as tall as you are?|
22409|...|
22410|I'm hungry! Do you have any candy?|
22411|This kid won't shut up! Will you take him away from here?|
22412|Oh, are you taking me to my mom?|
22413|Sidney starts following you.|
22414|Sidney's mom should be in Nudak Fortress by now. You should bring him there.|
22415|Mom!|
22416|Finally, you've come back! The Varan didn't hurt you, did they?|
22417|No, they were nice to me! But some of them seem unhappy...|
22418|It doesn't matter. All I care about is that you're safe.|
22419|Look at all these carts. All I have to do is hide in one, and they'll never be able to find me.|
22420|Dwight has hidden himself in a cart.|
22421|Now I can get out of here easily.|
22422|How come there is a cart here?|
22423|I don't remember putting one here.|
22424|Does it matter? Just take it to Krok Village.|
22425|Yes, sir!|
22426|...|
22427|It's time to go to work.|
22428|Just bring this Energy Detector along. It will show the energetic levels of the surrounding areas.|
22429|The Energy Detector is showing an unusually high level of energy near here.|
22430|Unbelievable! That cave is emitting huge amounts of energy!|
22431|If we can harness that energy, we could run the entire village!|
22432|The device is working properly.|
22433|Nothing out of the ordinary. Continue detecting.|
22434|The Desert Jerboa noticed that someone was approaching, and it scurried off into the desert.|
22435|You need to catch it before it notices you.|
22436|Is that the legendary Desert Jerboa? Let me see!|
22437|Boris peeks into the sack to get a closer look at the Desert Jerboa.|
22438|The Desert Jerboa leaps out of the sack and runs away.|
22439|Shoot, that's the third time I've done that! Quick, after it!|
22440|As soon as Bermuda took the Small Skeleton from your hands, a Little Triceragon appeared.|
22441|Bermuda threw the Small Skeleton.|
22442|The Little Triceragon is happily chewing on the bones.|
22443|Huh.  So the Small Skeleton works after all! So much for that theory...|
22444|With a happy smile, Tia tied the flower in her hair.|
22445|I'm definitely going to be the talk of the ball tonight!|
22446|Oh! Is that Tia? Are you still preparing for tonight's ball?|
22447|Sharon waves her hands about as she speaks, deliberately showing off her elegant jewelry.|
22448|I'm almost done! I'm really looking forward to tonight.|
22449|Tia flips her hair, showing Sharon the Desert Flower.|
22450|Hmph!|
22451|Tee hee!|
22452|Blast! I need more accessories! I can't lose to the likes of her...|
22453|The nest is right up ahead. Let's go!|
22454|As you approach the nest, you are confronted by an angry Rex.|
22455|There it is again! Get rid of it!|
22456|Even with it's injury, the Rex still refuses to budge from in front of the nest.|
22457|Hmm. I suppose that must be the mother.|
22458|Let's leave. We can't blame her for wanting to protect her young. I will continue to study them from afar.|
22459|You've come across a strange compass. It's needle is pointing towards the entrance to the Sand Owl Camp.|
22460|The compass needle has begun pointing to the south.|
22461|The compass needle has begun pointing to the west.|
22462|The compass needle has begun pointing right at Isaias.|
22463|You've found the legendary Star Sand Compass! That's awesome!|
22464|All I need to do now is inlay this Star Stone into the compass, and then it will point me right to the Star Sand's Secret Treasure!|
22465|After Isaias inlaid the Star Stone into the compass, the needle began to spin wildly.|
22466|After a few moments the needle stopped spinning, and pointed to the northeast.|
22467|Looks like the treasure is that-a-way! I'm off! I'll repay you after I find it!|
22468|Now's our chance! The bandit's treasure trove is at the bottom of this cliff! Let's head down there while the bandits are away.|
22469|This is it! This is where I saw the door open when they spoke the password!|
22470|Sesame Cookies!|
22471|... Nothing is happening.|
22472|What? How... I'm sure that's the password.|
22473|You hear footsteps and voices approaching.|
22474|Oh no, the bandits are on their way back! Quick, hide!|
22475|Those sesame cookies we had last time were pretty good, but not great. Maybe today we should order some takeout.|
22476|I'm feeling like lamb. You want lamb? Let's get a nice roast lamb.|
22477|One of the bandits removed a key from his pocket and opened the hidden door. The two of them kept chatting about food as they stepped inside.|
22478|A key? There wasn't a password at all! Boy, is my face red...|
22479|That's the Tiny Pyramid! Excellent! Now all we need to do is insert this into the proper spot at the altar.|
22480|Morris inserted the Tiny Pyramid into the triangular hole in the altar. After a moment, he altar began to make strange noises.|
22481|System Booted. Please Enter Your ID Code.|
22482|ID Code? What does that mean?|
22483|Invalid Entry. Activating Defenses.|
22484|A hush descends on the altar as several demons blinks into existence.|
22485|A trap? Run!|
22486|Upon closer inspection, you notice that one of the cactus flowers looks different than the rest.|
22487|I didn't expect you to find me so easily! That's right, I'm the Mysterious Cactoid!|
22488|Are you looking for the Mysterious Cactus Fruit? I'm afraid I can't allow that.|
22489|You have found all of the team members. Report back to the team leader!|
22490|I lost... Here, you have earned this cactus fruit.|
22491|Is this fruit from the Mysterious Cactoid? It looks just like any other cactus. I suppose we won't know until someone eats it.|
22492|The Desert Jerboa has been snared. Go capture it!|
22493|Marvin wolfed down the entire cactus fruit in a single bite.|
22494|Hmm... This flavor...|
22495|It tastes the same as any other cactus fruit!|
22496|Inside the treasure chest is a note: "Under the Gaze of the Giant Dragon."|
22497|It sounds like a clue. You should try and find a place like this.|
22498|After you read the note, it dissolves into sand and is blown away by the wind.|
22499|There is an oddly shaped mound nearby.|
22500|Buried in the mound is a note: "In the Shadow of the Great Tower."|
22501|After you read the note, it dissolves into sand and slips through your fingers.|
22502|There is a small box hidden in the shadows.|
22503|Inside the box is a note: "The Pouring White Sands."|
22504|After you read the note, it evaporates into a flash of starlight.|
22505|There is a small cloth bag tucked into a rocky crevice.|
22506|What? The team's being told to report in?|
22507|But... I haven't healed yet! I need to stay in the hospital for, um, for observation!|
22508|You're fine! You've already been here for weeks longer than you needed to be. Stop distracting the doctors and the other patients and go back to work!|
22509|Let's keep going. We should be able to get better data up ahead.|
22510|Yes! I'm on my way!|
22511|What? I thought I still had three days of vacation time! Ugh, fine, I'll go.|
22512|I have to report this to the Village Chief right away!|
22513|Yes, three desserts and two bottles of wine. To go, please.|
22514|Okay, I'll go back to work. I've been bored to death anyway.|
22515|I'll just go now. Bye.|
22516|Good luck and be careful!|
22517|Great! Everyone is here.|
22518|Pack up your gear and your necessities. We meet at the gate in half an hour.|
22519|Yes sir!|
22520|Sigh... Looks like I have to leave Camilla again.|
22521|Is there a problem, Kasim?|
22522|No, sir! I'll go get ready right away.|
22523|Thanks for all of your help! Looks like we might actually be ready to face some battles soon.|
22524|The trap is all set. Now you just need to lure a Mountain Dimetrodon into it.|
22525|A Mountain Dimetrodon got caught in the trap.|
22526|As thanks for releasing me, I can grand you three wishes!|
22527|...at a very reasonable price, of course.|
22528|There it is again! I can't let it damage my goods!|
22529|Help me...|
22530|Sidney: Mom packed up and left in such a hurry that she forgot to take me with her!|
22531|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Sonjuno was defeated.|
22532|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Kayel was defeated.|
22533|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Titanus was defeated.|
22534|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Argus was defeated.|
22535|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Asheara was defeated.|
22536|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Frederic was defeated.|
22537|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Talen was defeated.|
22538|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Talamund was defeated.|
22539|The rhino is resting after eating all of the bait. Now's your chance!|
22540|The rhino is going berserk!|
22541|Help!|
22542|Everybody run!|
22543|Note: You need the Dimensional Crystal Key to enter the Dimensional Corridor.|
22544|Three Dimensional Shackles can be found in the Dimensional Corridor. You will need three Dimensional Crystal Keys to open them all.|
22545|Western Shackle is unlocked. Power is flowing to the Enchanted Stone.|
22546|Northern Shackle is unlocked. Power is flowing to the Enchanted Stone.|
22547|Eastern Shackle is unlocked. Power is flowing to the Enchanted Stone.|
22548|All three Shackles are unlocked. The Enchanted Stone begins to glow¡K|
22549|A Magic Circle appears on the ground. A gate is about to open¡K|
22550|The Dimensional monster has come through the gate! You must destroy it!|
22551|The monster has fallen. The unstable energy in the air is settling.|
22552|Tell the Mage that you've destroyed the Dimensional monster.|
22553|The Young Sarpa is happily following you, hoping it will get more food.|
22554|Yes! My research has finally paid off!|
22555|The Unicorn nods its head at Charlie, as if it's trying to say "thank you."|
22556|These Unicorns are intelligent creatures after all! I need to work hard to save as many as possible.|
22557|Ew, Bug Eggs! I cant stand those little menaces.|
22558|I finally understand just how you feel about me. Let's go get married!|
22559|Nina... Hear me out...|
22560|Nina takes Luke's hand as they head off toward the village.|
22561|Penny, the Scholar's Assistant in Candetonn, must be eager to study the Young Sarpa.|
22562|You have to complete the quest "Lv50 Magic Detecting" before you can enter Deep's Cavern.|
22563|Navea Stall Area|
22564|You led the Silverflash Ambassador back to Nudak Fortress.|
22565|Thank you for bringing me the Lighting Device. At least someone is willing to listen to me...|
22566|Come on. Let's go into the Ghostweep Cave and find that energy source!|
22567|You told the Village Chief that you were here to try and persuade him to come back with you.|
22568|What!? How could you side with those cowards?|
22569|The angry Village Chief attacks you!|
22570|Sidney: Mom kept talking about some kinda fortress... You think maybe she went there?|
22571|The compass was supposed to point me to this Star Stone and then to the treasure...  But since I only have the Stone, I'm stuck!|
22572|Research one (Substitute)|
22573|Research one (Substitute)|
22574|Research one (Substitute)|
22575|Research one (Substitute)|
22576|Research one (Substitute)|
22577|Research one (Substitute)|
22578|No problem! Just give me one moment.|
22579|Taylor spoke to the doorman in a hushed voice for a while. When they were done speaking, you were allowed to enter.|
22580|There is a seemingly endless staircase behind the door. After what felt like an eternity, you reached a secret basement at the bottom.|
22581|Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "Fight Club!"|
22582|Today, we have a special guest...|
22583|This hero single-handedly took back the Demarech Mines and defeated Argus with god-like efficiency!|
22584|Tonight, and tonight only, we have an Envoy of Gaia in the battle!|
22585|Everyone, join me in welcoming the Envoy to the ring!|
22586|Alright! Now let's meet our challengers...|
22587|Give it up for Assault Union from the Demarech Mines!|
22588|Make some noise for the Thunderlions, straight outta Ventos Prairie!|
22589|Put your hands together for the Dwarf Princesses of Cactakara Forest!|
22590|Because we have such a prestigious warrior in the ring, the rules are a little different. The Envoy must defeat every single opponent in order to win!|
22591|The Assault Union versus the Envoy! Both sides are ready, so let's get on with it!|
22592|The Thunderlions versus the Envoy! Both sides are ready, so let's get on with it!|
22593|The Dwarf Princesses versus the Envoy! Both sides are ready, so let's get on with it!|
22594|The Assault Union's captain, Shaggy Harden, enters the ring!|
22595|The Thunderlions' captain, Lion-Leo, enters the ring!|
22596|The Dwarf Princess' captain, Granby, enters the ring!|
22597|Once the leader of a ruthless band of pirates, he dropped his life of plundering booty to take a job as a foreman in the mines!|
22598|It is said that his mystical sword gives him "Vision Beyond Vision," whatever that means. He's also rumored to have his own theme song!|
22599|You try growing up as a Dwarven Princess! It isn't exactly a life of privilege and favor, or so she insisted before the match. Now lets see how all that teenage angst translates into a fight!|
22600|That's it! The match is over! The winner is...|
22601|The hero of the people, the hope of the future...  Envoy of Gaia!|
22602|Everybody give the Envoy a big hand! What a battle!|
22603|You joyfully celebrate your victory with the others. As the party began to wind down, you made your way out of the club.|
22604|Quick! Get in the ring and respond to the audience's cheers!|
22605|Everyone is in their places and ready. Let the battle begin!|
22606|What a loser! Let me show you how it's done.|
22607|Get outta my way. I'll show you how a professional does it.|
22608|Oh man, I didn't expect to go down so quickly...|
22609|The boss will avenge my failure!|
22610|My prince, you've underestimated your enemy. Allow me, Osbert, to finish the job!|
22611|Let me try, I'll definitely win!|
22612|Fenrir has a target lock on you! Don't let him hit you, otherwise he'll recover HP!|
22613|Joshua's Reservation|
22614|Ada led you to the base of a cliff.|
22615|You and Ada quickly ran and hid behind a nearby rock.|
22616|No way! How come this "Mysterious Cactus" tastes the same as any other one?|
22617|Oh, I guess it could just be me. Perhaps my palate just isn't refined enough to appreciate it.|
22618|Then it's decided! I need to train my tastebuds by sampling the finest food Azuria has to offer!|
22619|Marvin bids you good day and struts off in search of gourmet cuisine.|
22620|Take the Moonlight Rabbit back to Immanuel|
22621|Bring the Moonlight Rabbit back to Immanuel as soon as possible.|
22622|You hear very faint cries from somewhere close by. It must be the missing Moonlight Rabbit.|
22623|As you approach the treasure chest, you hear disdainful laughter.|
22624|Tsubaki: "Ha ha ha!"|
22625|In a flash, Tsubaki appeared before you.|
22626|Tsubaki: "You won't claim this treasure so easily."|
22627|Tsubaki: "You will have to get past me first!"|
22628|The fierce battle tore open the boundaries between worlds, allowing <Iron Titan> Gigas to step through.|

22640|The Dimensional Fissure closed, and the Eidolons returned to their own world.|
22641|<Iron Titan> Gigas is somewhere in the forest. Find it!|
22642|<Knight of the Sun> Aelius is somewhere in the forest. Find him!|
22643|<Duke of Darkness> Eligos is somewhere in the forest. Find him!|

22653|The hall is empty except for several Mirror Orbs floating about.|
22654|The Mirror Orbs seemed to understand that there were people in the hall, and they began to pulsate with light.|
22655|The Mirror Orbs began to project images that had been recorded eons ago.|
22656|After the images died down, noises began to echo around the hall.|
22657|Someone with an authoritative voice began to address the crowd.|
22658|Thank you all for joining me here.|
22659|The Woodbeasts can no longer be allowed to go about murdering our friends and family and destroying our homes!|
22660|I have gathered you all here at the base of the mountain to eradicate these beasts!|
22661|We must burn the entire forest down! Let not a single Woodbeast escape our flames!|
22662|The militia cheered loudly after hearing the speech.|
22663|Ganlin, my friend... I am counting on your magic and trickery, even though I do not trust it.|
22664|Cyril... How often must I remind you that a tool is only as evil as the one who wields it?|
22665|So you have told me. Fine, let's not argue. Come on, men, time to prepare for battle!|
22666|Ganlin and his wizards began pouring their magical energy into the stove, raising it to a searing temperature.|
22667|There was a rumbling like an earthquake, and from the forest came a great commotion.|
22668|Men! To arms! Do not cower, for this battle shall be forever remembered!|
22669|Fend off the Woodbeasts that are emerging from the forest. The wizards need time to heat up the stove.|
22670|Cyril! How many men can you spare? I need someone to collect Forest Essences in order to keep this fire burning!|
22671|Several Forest Essences are nearby. Send some men to collect them and keep feeding the stove!|
22672|There are too many of them! We need to get the fires started or we won't live through the day!|
22673|Burning down all five Vibrant Trees will stop the Woodbeast's attack, I'm sure of it!|
22674|Another tremor rumbled through the battlefield as a gigantic Woodbeast approached.|
22675|Stand together, men! We must stop it!|
22676|In the vision, you can see that Head Researcher Sainz has been trapped in front of the instrument.|
22677|Oh no, another one! Lead him away from here!|
22678|Regroup! Stay in formation!|
22679|Cyril! Send someone to collect the Shaped Flame Spirit and use it to burn down a Vibrant Tree!|
22680|Some researchers have collapsed nearby. What happened to them?|
22681|The first Vibrant Tree has been burned down! We are one step closer to victory!|
22682|As the last Vibrant Tree was reduced to ash, the Woodbeasts began to retreat back into the forest.|
22683|We've done it! We've won!|
22684|So you think you've won, ignorant humans?|
22685|Who is that?|
22686|It's a monster! I'll destroy it!|
22687|Cough, cough... What strange power is this?|
22688|I am Fink, Guardian of the Eastern Forest. Your pitiful resistance is no match for me.|
22689|I'll show you who is a match for whom! Take this! Wha- what?|
22690|Ha! Do you think I've shown you even a fraction of my true strength? How naive.|
22691|Come! I will be waiting at the summit of the mountain, if you feel brave or foolish.|
22692|The Mirror Orbs cease their activity, and the images before you disappear.|
22693|It seems like that is all you will see on this level. Head up and find out whats on the next level!|
22694|Theodore: "Power supply... Check. Weaponry... Check."|
22695|Theodore: "Threat detected. Solution: execute."|
22696|The Orbs dimmed and the vision vanished. The real Theodore appeared in the hall.|
22697|Visions filled the hall once more, resuming the story where it had left off.|
22698|You have completed the challenges on this floor, and the way to higher levels has opened.|
22699|Don't try straying from the four magic barriers for long, or my arcane power will make short work of you!|
22700|You must suppress the four powers at the same time, otherwise the one that was not suppressed will explode, dealing constant damage to all characters.|
22701|You douse the burning soldier with water and the fire goes out.|
22702|The soldier looks at you gratefully, then throws up into the container.|
22703|The soldier looks around in confusion, as if unsure about what has hurt him.|
22704|The events recorded by the Orb have been shown, and the visions slowly disappear.|
22705|It seems that these Orbs contain a visual record of events that took place long in the past.|
22706|When someone enters the Tower, the visions held in the Mirror Orbs begin to play out.|
22707|Those visions can be just as real as any monster, and serve as the protectors of the Sky Tower's secrets.|
22708|Black Marsh: "Humans, we live here, and coexist with nature."|
22709|Black Marsh: "We have never acted aggressively towards you, yet you attack our people indiscriminately."|
22710|Black Marsh: "And now you have invaded our territory in an attempt to wipe us out entirely!"|
22711|Black Marsh: "Humans! We will no longer tolerate these abuses!"|
22712|The Mechanical Core has reappeared on this level. There are several researchers around it.|
22713|Mechanical Core: "System diagnostics. Reboot. Checking power supply... Overloaded."|
22714|Mechanical Core: "Discharge excess power. Tampering evident. Switching to Defense Mode."|
22715|The Orbs dimmed as the visions vanished. The real concrete Core appeared once more inside the hall.|
22716|Mechanical Core: "Power discharge complete. Defense Mode terminated."|
22717|D-d-did you hear that? It sounds like v-v-voices!|
22718|You can hear that too? I thought I might have been imagining things.|
22719|C-c-could it be that those d-d-dead Slimelings are coming b-b-back to haunt us?|
22720|That's just silly. There's no such thing as ghosts.|
22721|And besides... Why would the ghost of a Slimeling bother you? You were never afraid of the living ones.|
22722|Y-y-you don't u-understand!|
22723|Who's out there? Hey, you, come out and show yourself!|
22724|L-l-l-look at the s-s-size of that Slimeling! How c-c-can we fight it?|
22725|Stay and get killed if you want. I'm out of here!|
22726|W-w-wait for me!|
22727|You've collected some Forest Essence. Quick, drop it into the Arcane Brazier!|
22728|The Arcane Brazier is burning a bit hotter now. Keep feeding more Forest Essences into the fire!|
22729|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 20% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22730|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 40% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22731|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 60% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22732|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 80% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22733|The flame in the Arcane Brazier has become so hot that a Shaped Flame Spirit was created.|
22734|The Shaped Flame Spirit is looking for a Vibrant Tree to burn down.|
22735|After producing a Shaped Flame Spirit, the Arcane Brazier has cooled down. It needs more Forest Essences before it can produce another spirit.|
22736|The Shaped Flame Spirit has burned down a Vibrant Tree! Keep collecting Forest Essences so you can burn down the rest!|
22737|Without warning, a huge figure emerged from the forest.|
22738|The Horror Quagmire has appeared!|
22739|Don't allow Horror Quagmire to to fuse with Black Marsh! This will heal Black Marsh.|
22740|Wait! Hey, where are you going? I said wait!|
22741|Destroy these creatures, brothers! Don't let them run! Chase them all the way to the summit!|
22742|There is a large gathering of Trolls, at at the center of which is a Parallax Troll.|
22743|There is a great clamor of angry voices; it seems this Parallax Troll is not particularly welcome.|
22744|The Mirror Orb begins to resonate with magical energy, and once again visions again fill the hall.|
22745|What appears before you is the image of a group of humans surrounding the Black Marsh as its life ebbs away.|
22746|The scholar Gammon has been mortally wounded. He collapses to the ground and breathes his last.|
22747|Black Marsh lumbered over to Gammon's side to see if the man was still breathing.|
22748|Black Marsh laid down beside Gammon and quietly passed away.|
22749|The argument is heating up. At any moment, it could turn into a brawl.|
22750|The vision of <Desert Stalwart> Zangis is no longer just a vision! It has taken form and entered into battle.|
22751|The vision of <The Butcher> Ashworth is no longer just a vision! It has taken form and entered into battle.|
22752|The vision of <Seriously Insane> Zolg is no longer just a vision! It has taken form and entered into battle.|
22753|A shimmering magical energy washed over the area, and the Secret Treasure Chest appeared.|
22754|Moon God: "Heh heh.. I found you."|
22755|As the light faded, Moon God appeared.|
22756|Moon God: "I'll never let you greedy people have the Secret Treasure Chest."|
22757|Moon God: "I will punish you, in the name of the moon!"|
22758|The buildings here seem familiar. You're certain you've seen them before.|
22759|You recall your dream about the Shadow Knight so long ago; this looks like that very place! However, there are some small differences...|
22760|A frozen seal rests in the center of the hall, calmly holding a great power at bay.|
22761|It seems to react to the presence of an Envoy of Gaia, however, as the seal begins to change.|
22762|Images begin to appear in the frozen surface.|
22763|I've had enough of you, weakling. I'm beginning to lose interest in toying with you.|
22764|Wha... What are you talking about? I haven't collapsed yet.|
22765|That can be fixed quite easily.|
22766|Wait! Wait one moment, I have an offer to make.|
22767|Make it quick, worm. I grow tired of this.|
22768|We shall battle to first blood, not to death. The first to draw blood on the other is the winner.|
22769|Why would I accept such terms? The sight of my own blood has never stayed my blade before now.|
22770|Wait, let me finish!|
22771|Then finish! Why do you speak so slowly?|
22772|One drop of blood in exchange for the lives of the people we represent. If you win, my people are yours to do with us as you please, and I will forever live with the shame of my failure. And you will do the same if I win.|
22773|You would barter the lives of your people for your own? Ha! Coward!|
22774|You only get this one chance to accept my offer, Fink. Decide now and let us finish this.|
22775|Very well, worm. In the name of my ancestors, I accept your terms.|
22776|Then I declare this contest to have begun. The first to draw blood shall be the winner.|
22777|Ha ha! Come at me, then! I am eager to be rid of your kind once and for all.|
22778|Wait, one more thing!|
22779|What in blazes is it now? Spit it out!|
22780|Why do you keep penguins in your forest?|
22781|Penguins? What is this nonsense about penguins?|
22782|Over there...|
22783|Ahh!|
22784|Fink, you gullible fool! Your blood has been spilled, and that means you've lost. Now you must hold to your word.|
22785|A blinding light suddenly erupts from the seal, knocking you backwards.|
22786|Low Voice: Deception and trickery! Is nothing below you foul humans?|
22787|Sky Tower Defense System: Alert! Containment field on fourth level prison has been disrupted. Fourth level is being locked down...|
22788|Low Voice: This may be a prison, worms, but it is still my prison. How dare you defile it!|
22789|Low Voice: Today you will face a grudge that is centuries old!|
22790|As Fink fell before you, the Tower began showing you images once again.|
22791|How dare you cheat like that! I will kill you!|
22792|You made a vow, Fink! In the name of your ancestors! Honor it!|
22793|Devilish trickery! You despicable, cruel, unfair creature!|
22794|One man's trickery is another's genius. Do you really think I could have bested you in a fair fight? Certainly not. So I bested you in a battle of wits instead!|
22795|...|
22796|Very well. Do what you will with me, just let my people leave this place in peace.|
22797|If you are trying to make me change the terms of our agreement, perhaps you should be a bit more humble.|
22798|Watch your tongue, human. You speak to a child of the gods themselves. I have conceded enough to you already.|
22799|Then you should mind your tone as well, 'child of the gods,' for you speak to the future king of these lands.|
22800|I will forgive you this time, Fink, and I will accept your request. Your people may live in the East City Forest, but they will live there under my rule.|
22801|You, on the other hand, will be sealed away. Imprisoned for all eternity in a place where no one might stumble across you.|
22802|It appears I have no choice. I will accept my punishment, but know that I will never forget this.|
22803|Ganlin, who had rendered himself invisible, suddenly reappeared.|
22804|Ah, Ganlin. I trust you witnessed all of this? I need you to seal Fink away inside of a Fragment.|
22805|Ganlin nodded to Cyril, and then began muttering an incantation over the Fragments in his hands.|
22806|I have held my promise, human, and so must you. If you go back on your word, I swear to you I will escape this prison and come for your head.|
22807|Fink shimmered and then vanished, his spirit absorbed into the Fragments in Ganlin's hands.|
22808|Fortunately, Fink is a proud ruler. If he hadn't kept his promise, we'd be in a lot of trouble.|
22809|Trouble? No, we'd most certainly be dead.|
22810|I do wonder how well that prison holds up, though. I'd hate to be the one to face him if he were to break out.|
22811|Best not to worry about it. Let's just take Fink's Soul and leave this place.|
22812|Several engineers were scurrying about, setting up Water Purifiers.|
22813|We'll go now, Master!|
22814|Abyssal Mud suddenly appeared began attacking the engineers!|
22815|Galia, you have such a big mouth!|
22816|I'm innocent!|
22817|Belenus better mean what he says. Otherwise his precious Navea will be no more.|
22818|Hmmmm. He will, he will...|
22819|The Orb flashes again, bringing to light more images from times past.|
22820|Everything will be fine, just fine. Just follow our script to the letter.|
22821|Sky Tower Defense System: Dangerous energy levels detected. Level is being locked down.|
22822|Waves of energy flooded through the area, making the air unbearably hot.|
22823|Up ahead the Infernal Disciple awaits a challenger.|
22824|You have passed the Infernal Disciple's trial. The path to the next level has opened.|
22825|You cannot advance to the next level unless you are in the "Infernal Trial" status.|
22826|Obtained "Infernal Trial" status.|
22827|You are qualified to challenge my incarnation!|
22828|Ha ha! It seems I made the right choice in allowing you to undergo this challenge! I will wait for you deeper within.|
22829|Ah, you are finally here! Now, show me your strength!|
22830|Bwa ha ha! You are worthy of the title of Envoy of Gaia after all! I will add my strength to yours!|
22831|You've delevered the summons. Go let Bernard know his people are on the way.|
22832|Leanne took several young boys and girls to a mysterious cave.|
22833|There are no traces of humans in sight, just veins of crystal and many Dragon Eggs.|
22834|Where did all of these eggs come from? There are no dragons in this region...|
22835|Leanne was shocked to find her bunny puppet there.|
22836|Watch out!|
22837|The Mirror Orb flickers and releases a burst of energy, momentarily distorting the image of Leanne.|
22838|The visions begin to overlap with reality as the energy field expanded.|
22839|As the energy continues to swell, the image of Leanne vanishes in a cloud of smoke. Once that smoke clears, you see...|
22840|A dragon has appeared! Not just a vision but a flesh-and-blood dragon!|
22841|The energy generated by the Orb dies off, and the visions begin to play once more.|
22842|As the children started to relax, two more dragons similar to Leanne appeared.|
22843|Oh no, more Giant Dragons!|
22844|A neverending swarm of Slimelings continued to try and destroy the Water Purifiers.|
22845|The Water Purifiers must be protected.|
22846|The visions on this level have ended, and a huge Treasure Chest has appeared in the center of the room.|
22847|Vhell has summoned a Primordial Flowertrap! Quick, bring it to the bonfire!|
22848|Karka has summoned a War Totem; drag it away, or else it will make him stronger!|
22849|Karka has summoned an Earth Totem; drag it away, or else it he won't take any damage!|
22850|Karka has summoned a Thunder Totem; stay out of the reach of it's attacks!|
22851|Karka has summoned a War Totem; drag it away, or else it will continuously heal him!|
22852|The Dragon's Servant is hatching eggs to restore Leanne's HP. Defeat them quickly!|
22853|You prepared to go on a dangerous trip with Hass to collect Dragon Bell Grass.|
22854|Your job is to keep Haas safe during the journey.|
22855|You need to be keeping Haas safe! Don't go running around recklessly.|
22856|Haas took a moment to rearrange the supplies in the cart, then carefully placed the Dragon Bell Grass inside.|
22857|After taking a moment to catch his breath, Haas wiped the sweat off his forehead and looked at you.|
22858|Leanne: "Sob sob..."|
22859|The Young Adventurer ran over to Leanne's side.|
22860|The Young Explorer told the Young Adventurer to look into the distance.|
22861|After hearing this question, Leanne felt ill at ease.|
22862|The Young Adventurer consoled Leanne, and she eventually calmed down.|
22863|The Rampaging Fire Sprite shrugs off most attacks. Only a Water Bomb can harm it.|
22864|Someone who takes a dip in the watery powers of the Pool can use the Water Bomb once.|
22865|There are three Treasure Chests ahead; open the one you think is best suited for you.|
22866|You can only open one of the three chests, so choose wisely.|
22867|Your intuition appears to be correct! There is some good stuff hidden here.|
22868|"Hmm... I don't think I can dig any more today..."|
22869|Nice job! You've found a bunch of buried relics!|
22870|This doesn't feel right. Try digging somewhere else.|
22871|Amanita and Voltaire walked out of the crowd and greeted Karka with a bow.|
22872|Amanita and Voltaire walked up to Karka and Gareth, and then began the prayer.|
22873|Once the last Rampaging Fire Sprite was put out, peace again returned to the area.|
22874|Visions swirled about once again, continuing to tell stories that hadn't been told for centuries.|
22875|You find a muddy chalice stuck in the muck.|
22876|A strange energy similar to that of the nearby Golden Pool makes you suspect that there is some relation...|
22877|Try throwing the glass into the pool, perhaps something interesting will happen.|
22878|After Amara spoke, a flash of lightning suddenly strikes you!|
22879|You were quite startled, but the lightning seems to have not harmed you.|
22880|You throw the chalice into the pool and watch as a golden water sprite slowly rises up.|
22881|You can hear voices coming from the hall ahead... Why not listen and try to find out what happened...|
22882|...There, that's the whole story. I hope you were listening closely, I won't repeat myself!|
22883|Our leader intends to join forces with the Shadow Knight - you all better be prepared!|
22884|The Shadow Knight?! What's going on... Could it be...|
22885|Uh, boss? Someone's eavesdropping on us!|
22886|Didn't I tell you to keep quiet and listen to - Wait, what did you say?! Who's out there! Show yourself!|
22887|Yikes, the guards! Looks like a temporary retreat is in order...|
22888|After the sounds of prayer fade, a wash of light falls across Karka and Gareth.|
22889|Once the light dissipates, Amanita and Voltaire bow to Karka again.|
22890|The world goes silent as Karka slowly materializes into the world, tangible at last.|
22891|Once more, visions begin to appear in front of the crowd. Gareth slowly retreats into the background.|
22892|Suddenly, Karka vomits up an incredible amount of thick, black blood and topples to the ground.|
22893|Amanita dashes out from the crowd to Karka's side, examining his injuries.|
22894|Joining forces, Zangis, Ashworth, and Zolg stop Gareth and disarm him.|
22895|Shocked, Gareth still manages to keep a cool head.|
22896|Gareth shifts his gaze to Amanita and sees a strange smile on his face.|
22897|Karka angrily shouts out Amanita's name before vomiting up more blood.|
22898|While pretending to tend to Karka's injuries, Amanita dripped some kind of strange liquid into his mouth.|
22899|Karka's body jerks a few times and he suddenly stops breathing.|
22900|Gareth smirks and stares at Amanita, mouthing a sentence...|
22901|The outlying mire having already been purified, the engineers proceed with preparations to tackle the enormous mire situation in the center.|
22902|Golly, what's that over there? Quick, someone come take a look!|
22903|Theodore has set up machine guns all around this area, please be careful out there!|
22904|Theodore has set up even more of his machine guns here - don't stop moving!|
22905|The Positive Electrodes are affecting you - please keep a safe distance from party members affected with Negative Electrodes!|
22906|The Negative Electrodes are affecting you - please keep a safe distance from party members affected with Positive Electrodes!|
22907|Keep your distance from others when you've been targeted by Volt Charge!|
22908|A Dragon's Servant has appeared in the northern hall! Quickly, you must defeat it!|
22909|A Dragon's Servant has appeared in the southern hall! Quickly, you must defeat it!|
22910|The second Vibrant Tree has been burnt down - victory is that much closer!|
22911|Zangis uses the "Shield Wall of Desert" to reduce the DMG received by surrounding party members.|
22912|You've been hit by Covalece! Quickly, get to the the vicinity of an Earth Totem!|
22913|Use a Bright Orange Pumpkin Bomb on players!|
22914|Use a Cool Green Pumpkin Bomb on monsters!|
22915|As the chest appears, a disdainful laugh echoes through the air.|
22916|Judging by that outfit, you'll need my fashion help too.|
22917|Weily emerges from the brilliant light!|
22918|Weily: "The Secret Treasure is mine! You shall not lay your hands upon it!"|
22919|Weily: "You shall taste the full strength of my might!"|
22920|Magical Thorns cover the road ahead - you can't pass for the moment.|
22921|The magic from the thorns is dissipating! Now's the time to clear them away and push forward!|
22922|That's the third Vibrant Tree - only two more to go to victory!|
22923|You've burned down four Vibrant Trees. Only one remains now!|
22924|The fifth tree.....The last Vibrant Tree is finally destroyed. All of you have performed admirably!|
22925|A great many footfalls can be heard ahead. It seems like the tower is a popular place!|
22926|Ah, you must be the Envoy of Gaia that my lord Shadow Knight mentioned, correct?|
22927|Heh, the breaking of the seal will soon be complete! You are too late, you cannot stop it. Perhaps you will be up to a little test? No? TOO BAD!|
22928|Come on! Let me see if you're as good as my lord claims!|
22929|Hmph, you really are quite...skilled. Perhaps we'll do this again sometime, for another...evaluation.|
22930|This sudden earthquake....What's going on?|
22931|Mwahaha! It's nearly done! No one can stop us now!|
22932|Time to deliver the news to my lord Shadow Knight. Mwahaha...|
22933|Enter the Crystal Portal as fast as you can! You must make it to the altar in time to protect the seal!|
22934|The Ocean Tyrant, Fish King of the Port of Skandia, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should do so quickly!|
22935|The Shadow of the Deep, Fish King of Helonia Coast, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22936|The Golden Blossom, Fish King of Crescent Hill, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22937|The Ancient Witness, Fish King of Cactakara Forest, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22938|The Dark Crystal, Fish King of the Demarech Mines, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22939|The Hot Tempered Overlord, Fish King of the Triatio Highlands, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22940|The Defender of the Marsh, Fish King of Candeo Marsh, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22941|The Rainbow Caller, Fish King of the Ventos Prairie, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22942|The Deep Waterfall Ghost, Fish King of the Oblitus Wood , has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22943|The Sand-Spitting Hermit, Fish King of Star Sand Desert, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22944|Head coordinates (285,643) in Crescent Hill's for a chance at catching the Lucky Petal Fish!|
22945|No! The Sealed Crystal has been destroyed!|
22946|Something strange appears in the center of the Magic Circle. What's going to happen next...|
22947|The Thunder Dragon has emerged from the seal! Quickly now, slay him!|
22948|Crisis averted!|
22949|This is the Lucky Petal Fish's habitat...|
22950|Vachnam shouts into the dark cavern: "Tavana! Come out and meet your death!"|
22951|A huge figure emerges slowly - it's Tavana, the Blood Spider Queen!|
22952|Vachnam suddenly leaps forward, attacking Tavana!|
22953|Effortlessly, Tavana fends off Vachnam's futile attack, striking him to the ground in one blow.|
22954|Tavana waves her hand and Vachnam's body turns to stone and shatters, scattering pieces all around.|
22955|Aveline suddenly appears and rushes towards Vachnam's corpse.|
22956|Aveline raises her staff high into the air, chanting in the ancient tongue of the dragons.|
22957|Tavana's true form manifests into the realm of Terra - she is now tangible!|
22958|Panting heavily, Aveline looks like that spell took a lot out of her...|
22959|Tavana raises her hand to strike Aveline with a fatal blow!|
22960|Suddenly, a figure appears in front of Aveline, shielding her from Tavana's devastating attack.|
22961|After a long look into Aveline's eyes, Vachnam suddenly rushes towards Tavana.|
22962|He dashes fast as lightning, striking Tavana with a powerful blow!|
22963|Unable to react in time, Tavana takes the full force of Vachnam's onslaught.|
22964|Aveline, expressionless, walks to the severely injured Tavana.|
22965|Although her face looks expressionless, Aveline's voice is trembling with fear.|
22966|The time for words finished, Aveline ended Tavana's life of monstrosities.|
22967|As she takes in the sight of Tavana's corpse and the scattered stones, a strange smile appears on Aveline's face...|
22968|She raises her hand, preparing to finally end her own life.|
22969|Smack! Suddenly, a small stone came flying out of nowhere, putting a stop to her actions.|
22970|Looking hopeful, Aveline looks around eagerly...|
22971|Seeing nothing, the hopeful light in her eyes slowly dimmed.|
22972|Picking up the small stone, Aveline sheds a few silent tears.|
22973|Tavana, intending to gorge herself upon the Dragonborn blood of the Gogen family, entered the family manor one night to take their lives...|
22974|After drinking their blood and absorbing their power, Tavana left - stronger than ever.|
22975|Margaret Gogen, the lone survivor, saw everything in the dark. With a trembling fist, she smashed her fist against the barrier.|
22976|The gem embedded within the barrier split in two, crashing to the floor.|
22977|Almost losing her mind, the shriveled bodies of her family seemed to be laughing at Margaret. At her failure to protect them...|
22978|Somewhere in the wind, a hollow voice seems to be whispering words of revenge...|
22979|Suddenly, the Gogen Family Manor grew dark, an essence of evil spreading across the land...|
22980|Strong hatred... how delicious... you want to revenge... you need more power...|
22981|Power... I can give you power... come here... come closer...|
22982|Come, come!... Pick me up... Pick me up! I can give you power... power...|
22983|The instant Margaret picks up the staff it exploded in a great ray of light, encircling Margaret within its power.|
22984|A circle of both frost and flame spin faster and faster around her...|
22985|After the effects fade, Margaret's appearance is completely changed!|
22986|Margaret's heart has now become the heart of this strange staff. The place where her heart once was is naught but an empty hole...|
22987|At that very moment, a horde of Slimelings suddenly appear and surround Margaret.|
22988|Margaret lets out a gasp as she catches a glimpse of her own reflection upon the icy surface...|
22989|Touching her face at first, she then trails her hand down to the hole in her chest and pauses.|
22990|Suddenly, a strange, transparent object falls before Margaret's face.|
22991|The floating Mirror Orb begins to vibrate, triggering a warning when the adventurer approaches.|
22992|Finally approaching the ancient ruins, he offers up a prayer for strength.|
22993|As Heath wanders the area calling for Margaret, a blurred silhouette appeared before him.|
22994|Heath stares at Aveline cautiously, observing every strange detail.|
22995|Determined to become stronger, Heath leaves in search of a source of power.|
22996|By the by, don't tarry long outside the four magic barriers, or my arcane power will make short work of you!|
22997|My power over the Great Land is also a power of Balance. I can control the elements of fire, ice, wind, and thunder.|
22998|There can only be one worthy of inheriting my great power. This person must be able to both comprehend and control the powers of all elements simultaneously!|
22999|You must maintain control over the four elements at the same time. If you fail, that which is not under your control will explode, and the results will be devastating.|
23000|The Power of Flame in the northeast is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23001|The Power of Ice in the northwest is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23002|The Power of Storms in the southeast is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23003|The Power of Lightning in the southwest is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23004|The Flame Stone Guard in the northeast has been revived.|
23005|The Ice Stone Guard in the northwest has been revived.|
23006|The Storm Stone Guard in the southeast has been revived.|
23007|The Lightning Stone Guard in the southwest has been revived.|
23008|The unfinished memory begins to play once more.|
23009|Heath passed the test and has been granted the power, however...|
23010|As he observes the changing of his hands before his eyes, Heath speaks with a trembling voice.|
23011|Heath confirms that what he has seen of his new appearance is true.|
23012|Roaring with fury, Heath immediately heads back in search of Margaret.|
23013|Might I can grant you, but nothing comes for free. What price are you willing to pay, mortal?|
23014|Good... And yet, words alone carry too light a weight. See if you can pass my Trial of Stones.|
23015|If you pass the trial, I will grant my power to you.|
23016|You hear a muffled sound from the stinky flower bud nearby. Be on your guard!|
23017|The Crusader Captain raises his fingers to his mouth and whistles loudly.|
23018|You've been afflicted by the "Burnt" status! Move near to those with "Frostbite" to remove it.|
23019|You've been afflicted by the "Frostbite" status! Move near to those with "Burnt" to remove it.|
23020|Many Crusaders spring forth from the bushes, surrounding Aveline.|
23021|With a single swipe, Aveline knocks the wind out of her would-be attackers.|
23022|Aveline has summoned an invisible Guardian. Search where the arrows lead and try to root out the Guardian!|
23023|Aveline phases into Terra and begins to attack!|
23024|All the phantoms, Aveline, and the crusaders vanished from the battlefield...|
23025|Blindsided by the assault, Aveline starts casting random spells out of desperation.|
23026|After promising herself that she would never kill a human, the dead bodies all around seem to be mocking Aveline...|
23027|The Arachnid Dementors will continue to grow if left alive, and mature Arachnid Dementors will strengthen Tavana's powers.|
23028|Tavana has devoured the Arachnid Dementors, recovering health.|
23029|Tavana is preparing to cast her Toxic Net! Get to a safe location quickly!|
23030|Hunt down the Guardians to dispel Aveline's damage resistance.|
23031|When all the Guardians have been found, Aveline will lose her damage resistance.|
23032|All of a sudden, the Slimelings phase into reality and begin to approach as a group.|
23033|Weakened, Aveline phases out of the mortal realm. She must recover her strength, lest the Slimelings defeat her.|
23034|Defeat the Crossbreed Bats and retrieve their blood in order to help Aveline recover.|
23035|This floor is at peace, for now, and the phantom re-enters the realm, ready to continue!|
23036|Aveline absorbs the blood of the Crossbreed Bats, recovering slightly.|
23037|Aveline has recovered 20% of her strength - she needs more bat blood!|
23038|Aveline has recovered 40% of her strength - she's looking a bit better!|
23039|Aveline has recovered 60% of her strength - her power is growing even stronger!|
23040|Aveline has recovered 80% of her strength - almost there!|
23041|Aveline is completely recovered! She begins to cast a powerful spell!|
23042|As the events draw to a close, the vision cast by the orb slowly vanishes.|
23043|You have an iron will, mortal. It is something I can greatly appreciate.|
23044|You who have withstood the tumult; to you I shall grant my power.|
23045|The reliving of past memories has ended...for now.|
23046|The temperature is too high. Use the Water Bucket to douse the flames.|
23047|I am the Disciple charged with protecting the Whirlpool Abyss.|
23048|I've broken the Magic Barrier to Deep's Cavern.|
23049|Affected by the power of Gaia, the swirling blue crystals formed a huge whirlpool.|
23050|Swirl Disciples appear and try to stop the awakening of Nazrudin.|
23051|The Great Leviathan, Nazrudin, appears from the Swirling Gate!|
23052|The Great Leviathan, Nazrudin, has awakened from his nightmare!|
23053|Nazrudin: Envoy of Gaia! Dare you take on the might of the ocean?|
23054|Nazrudin: Noble Envoys of Gaia, I thank you for awakening me! You are worthy of my blessing!|
23055|The Swirling Gate can only remain open for 15 minutes.|
23056|The time remaining is 10 minutes. The Swirling Gate begins to grow unstable.|
23057|The time remaining is 5 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate begins to wane.|
23058|The time remaining is 3 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate is growing weaker and weaker.|
23059|The time remaining is 2 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate is growing weaker and weaker.|
23060|The time remaining is 1 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate is growing weaker and weaker.|
23061|The whirlpool dissipated before you were able to awaken the Great Leviathan, Nazrudin.|
23062|You've been teleported to the Phasic Flame Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23063|You've been teleported to the Phasic Ice Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23064|You've been teleported to the Phasic Storm Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23065|After being silent for a while, Aveline speaks once again.|
23066|Aveline waves her staff angrily. A spell of ice and fire gradually encircles Vachnam.|
23067|Aveline turns around to avoid looking into Vachnam's eyes...|
23068|Frowning in annoyance, Aveline sighs at Vachnam's stubbornness.|
23069|Vachnam softens his tone after seeing how Aveline frowns.|
23070|Aveline closes her eyes for a moment and then looks sternly at Vachnam.|
23071|Vachnam seems very anxious, as though afraid of something.|
23072|After listening to Vachnam's request, Aveline seems only slightly surprised.|
23073|After becoming a monster, surely nobody would care about her now... Aveline sulks.|
23074|Aveline's dark and sullen mood begins to attract negative energy that slowly begins to envelope her.|
23075|The Negative Energy Aggregate deal damage to Aveline. Defeat them as quickly as you can!|
23076|The Negative Condensation in the southeast has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23077|The Negative Condensation in the northwest has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23078|The Negative Condensation in the northeast has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23079|The Negative Condensation in the southwest has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23080|A freezing wind blows across the battlefield, swiftly smiting all the Slimelings in a single spell from Aveline's staff.|
23081|Red Phosphorus Mines, south of Candetonn.|
23082|Vachnam starts to gather the power of the Standing Stone Field - quickly, everyone must step into it!|
23083|Vachnam summons Split Vachnam and begins to heal himself! Quickly, defeat them and stop the healing!|
23084|Quickly find Moe and report back.|
23085|Zukitung: Haha! I'm back! Soon, all the treasure here will be in the claws of the Varan Bandits!|
23086|You have over 10 stacks of Torturing Flame! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23087|You have over 10 stacks of Frost Crack! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23088|You have over 10 stacks of Storm Breath! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23089|You have over 10 stacks of Ride the Lightning! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23090|It sounds like there are gears turning inside. Perhaps they're connected to some device!|
23091|You must destroy all the defense turrets so that the gate can be opened.|
23092|Aveline quickly corrected herself.|
23093|After a moment of doubt, Heak begins to speak.|
23094|Aveline seemed shocked to hear it.|
23095|Elder Yeshe uses his magic to teleport you back, saving you from the flames.|
23096|Moe and the rest of the group discussed what they saw happening...|
23097|Talk to Moe and find out what the group discussed.|
23098|Who dares to disturb my slumber...|
23099|Zukitung: Humph! Don't get too excited, you stubborn archaeologists! Like a bad penny, I'll turn up again!|
23100|The Thruster is now equipped. Fly to the end of the corridor and turn off the Flame Trap!|
23101|Help the Sacred Tree to grow|
23102|Charm Queen: Oh-hohohohoho~|
23103|You've been teleported to the Phasic Lightning Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23104|All the guardians must be found and destroyed to remove the protection they grant Aveline.|
23105|The Crossbreed Bat was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23106|The Savage Stone Turtle was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23107|The Spiny Crocodile was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23108|The Primeval Sprout was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23109|The Pastel Butterfly Fairy was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23110|Divine Branding stacks over 3 times! If you don't enter a Magic Circle, you'll keep taking high damage.|
23111|As the Secret Chest appeared, you heard a charming voice.|
23112|Vermilion: "Well well, look at this chest!"|
23113|An exotic figure emerged from the magic circle.|
23114|Vermilion: "You wanna brawl over this? Sounds like we could have some fun!"|
23115|Lang: The King's Precious Possession we found is in danger! We need backup from anyone who can help!|
23116|Natalie: Dangit! The King's Precious Possession is gonna get swiped if we don't do something! C'mon guys, give us a hand!|

23124|Natalie: Dangit! The Spring Maiden Statue is gonna get swiped if we don't do something! C'mon guys, give us a hand!|
23125|After Thunder Dragon Taloc fell, the tremendous energy in his body diffused into the hall.|
23126|The temple absorbed a tremendous amount of electrical energy - only a small amount remains on the ground.|
23127|A mysterious figure quietly floats into view...|
23128|I'm Serena, and I'm here to claim the Dragon King's treasure! Go on and get it, bunnies!|
23129|Hey! Why haven't you stopped? The secret treasure is all mine now, you guys can go home or whatever!|
23130|I'm Vermilion, the Phoenix Enchantress! None shall defile what I have decided I want!|
23131|Whoa there! If you guys don't put down the Treasure Chest right now, the next dart will be much more accurate than the first...|
23132|Torian put down the food, and went to the creek not far away to wash his hands.|
23133|A tiny figure approached quietly, picked up the food with its mouth, and left as quickly as it had come.|
23134|Torian found several footprints in the nearby area and he studied them for quite some time.|
23135|Following these footprints, Torian walked towards the forest.|
23136|The Tiny Hornwolf seemed to have understood what Torian said, and dropped its guard.|
23137|The Tiny Hornwolf approached happily, and took the food from Torian with its mouth.|
23138|The two little ones are sharing the food. It seems they're getting along pretty well.|
23139|Torian burps and turns around to check out the Tiny Hornwolf, who's still eating.|
23140|After the Tiny Hornwolf finished eating, it rubbed Torian gently.|
23141|The Tiny Hornwolf licked Torian's face affectionately, seeming to have agreed.|
23142|Fenrir seemed to notice something and took off in that direction.|
23143|Torian chased after Fenrir, shouting angrily.|
23144|By the time Torian caught up, Fenrir's jaws were wide open and ready for business.|
23145|Torian struck Fenrir hard enough to make him see stars.|
23146|With a repentant whimper, he gave Torian a careful nuzzle in return.|
23147|Torian picked up the Intoxicating Grass, which is exudes a rich aroma.|
23148|Both Torian and Fenrir then fell into a deep slumber under the effects of the fragrance.|
23149|Suddenly, a piercing wail roused Fenrir from his dream!|
23150|The Intoxicating Grass seemed to have been spooked - it stood as though in shock for a moment before fleeing.|
23151|He sprang at the Intoxicating Grass and knocked it unconscious with a claw.|
23152|He then returned to Torian and nudged him gently with one of his forepaws.|
23153|Torian was trapped in his nightmare - there seemed to be no sign of his waking.|
23154|After trying several times to no effect, the impatient Fenrir decided to take a good whack.|
23155|The tough love worked! Torian finally regained consciousness.|
23156|Torian walked to the Intoxicating Grass and packed it into the bag.|
23157|Torian took out the liquor jar, put in on the ground and then opened it.|
23158|Fenrir snuck his way to the liquor jar for a taste while Torian's attention was elsewhere.|
23159|Torian grabbed Fenrir's ear and dragged him into the nearby bushes.|
23160|On hearing this, Fenrir scratched at Torian's feet and howled, begging for mercy.|
23161|Torian lit a bonfire and roasted a Phantom Bunnyhop in no time.|
23162|After clearing the leftovers, Torian started to clean up after the fire.|
23163|While Torian was busy cleaning up, Fenrir ate all the leftover Phantom Bunnyhops.|
23164|Torian turned around to find tufts of Bunnyhop hair scattered about -- and Fenrir, his face a picture of innocence.|
23165|Seeing Torian freak out, Fenrir's ears drooped and he mentally prepared himself for a good whooping.|
23166|Before Torian finished his scolding, Fenrir bolted, leaving Torian standing dumbfounded.|
23167|Powerless, Fenrir lay on the side of the road, his stomach growling and gurgling.|
23168|Fenrir seemed to smell something, and ambled off in the direction the smell was coming from.|
23169|Following the delicious smell, Fenrir snuck into a restaurant's kitchen.|
23170|As he wolfed down the food and lapped up the wine, Fenrir felt like a million gold.|
23171|But poor Fenrir had a little TOO much wine, and ended up leaving the kitchen a disaster.|
23172|The frightened waiters rushed out into the street, and hearing their cries, the guards on patrol came running.|
23173|Fenrir wobbled out of the restaurant, not sure why all the guards were standing in the street.|
23174|Following Fenrir's tracks, Torian found his way to the restaurant.|
23175|He saw people scrambling around with ropes, trying to bind the unconscious Fenrir.|
23176|Frustrated, Torian sighed and went in the direction he thought Fenrir had gone.|
23177|After whipping out his knife and scaring the crowd away, Torian turned to check up on Fenrir.|
23178|Fenrir lay on the ground, reeking of booze. He was passed out cold, dreaming away.|
23179|An elegent woman in a plain dress walked toward them.|
23180|Leila raised her hand and stopped the Guard Captain before he finished speaking, then turned her head to get a good look at Torian.|
23181|Torian turned around and smacked Fenrir in the head.|
23182|Fenrir suddenly woke up with a start, leaping from the ground!|
23183|Torian smacked Fenrir again, then grabbed him by the ear and dragged him away.|
23184|Saint Nicolas: Excellent! I'll start repairing the sled straightaway! Just wait a bit while I go to work.|
23185|As Saint Nicolas was repairing the sleigh, the sky grew darker. The residents of the Small Winter Village went back home from the event too.|
23186|Saint Nicolas: The sleigh has been repaired, my young friend. Let's get this show on the road!|
23187|Jump onto the sleigh and then talk to Saint Nicolas to trigger the event.|
23188|The sleigh lurches forward with an unexpected heave! Aim carefully at the target and use the "Deliver Gift" skill to complete the mission.|
23189|The gift accidentally fell out of the sleigh. Please go back to the entrance and find Saint Nicolas to start over again.|
23190|From the front came a muffled roar, mingled with the gurgling cries of the dying.|
23191|The Bloody Mudpile is absorbing the flesh and blood of the nearby corpses.|
23192|The Bloody Mudpile is poking and prodding at the nearby corpses.|
23193|Not far away, several soldiers are confronting the Sarpa.|
23194|Misaena awkwardly rushes a teleportation spell, and as its incantation finishes, a Magic Barrier surrounds her.|
23195|With a flash of light, Misaena's form vanishes from the battlefield.|
23196|The next monster coming is ready to fight, so keep your guard up!|
23197|Be careful, there's another monster coming through the dimensional rift!!|

23208|A human figure suddenly appeared between Hel and the Thorny Flower Fairies.|
23209|Hel walked calmly past Bealdor, and vanquished the Thorny Flower Fairies with a simple spell.|
23210|Hel wished to continue exterminating the Thorny Flower Fairies, but Bealdor stopped her.|
23211|Bealdor looked back, only to find out all the Thorny Flower Fairies had disappeared.|
23212|A shadowy figure suddenly appeared before Hel and Bealdor.|
23213|After she finished speaking, Hel turned and left.|
23214|Gram followed Hel, and began to hear voices.|
23215|Gram: "Miss, you're heading in the wrong direction. You should have chosen the path on the left."|
23216|Hel: "Wrong again... how about you go first, Gram?"|
23217|Hel stopped suddenly when Gram appeared before her.|
23218|Gram's body grew to a tremendous size, blocking the exit.|
23219|Shortly after Bealdor left, Hel returned.|
23220|Hel went full circle and returned to where she started.|
23221|A tiny figure appeared nearby and slowly approached Hel.|
23222|Hel went to the exit, only to find it blocked by Gram.|
23223|Before Hel could strike him, Gram spoke.|
23224|Hel stopped suddenly, and looked around for the person Gram spoke of.|
23225|Somewhat shocked, Bealdor tried to pursue Hel, only to find she had already left.|
23226|Bealdor took out an exquisite chest and carefully placed the Light of Dawn inside.|
23227|Bealdor thought for a moment and waved his hands, casting a spell to make the chest vanish.|
23228|Bealdor took a piece of paper from his breast pocket. On it were strange drawings that even the gods couldn't decipher.|
23229|Bealdor threw the piece of paper on the ground in anger, but soon picked it up again.|
23230|Bealdor arrived at the Entrance to Pandemonium but was stopped by Gram, who had followed the Breath of Light.|
23231|With a wave of his hands, Bealdor's Exquisite Chest appeared before Gram.|
23232|Unable to dissuade Bealdor, Gram was forced to open the chest.|
23233|As the Light of Dawn shone upon him, Gram groaned. His body shuddered, transforming into a longsword and falling to the ground with a clatter.|
23234|Without giving him a chance to speak, Hel attacked Bealdor.|
23235|Jormungand waved his hand and sheathed Gram, who had transformed into a sword.|
23236|Saint Nicolas: Ah, are you an adventurer here to help me out? Come, come here!|
23237|Collect 5 Wooden Planks, 5 Ropes and 5 Inedible Red Fruits, then talk to Saint Nicolas to trigger the event.|
23238|Saint Nicolas: Hold on tight, we're heading back now!|
23239|Send Gift|
23240|Stand behind the sleigh to throw the gifts. That way you won't hit the sleigh, or Nicolas.|

23244|The Thorny Flower Fairies' phantoms have materialized, and the "Pandemonium Flame" has appeared in the center of the field.|
23245|When <Red> Thorny Flower Fairy starts growing armor, you can use the "Pandemonium Flame" to burn it.|
23246|Bealdor has manifested the darkness within him. The Pure Light Force now protects him from injury!|
23247|First, defeat the Dark Creatures emanating from Bealdor!|
23248|The Dark Creatures will turn into pure Dark Energy after they die, which can deal significant damage to surrounding enemies.|
23249|Dark Energy can pierce the Divine Light. The person targeted by the Dark Energy must lure it to Bealdor.|
23250|You've been targeted by the Dark Energy! Now lure it to Bealdor!|
23251|Bealdor's Divine Light has been breached, leaving him vulnerable to attack!|
23252|You're being damaged by the Light Force. Leave the Divine Light as quickly as possible.|
23253|Gram summons Phantom Crystals, and Gram's Phantom appears!|
23254|You can only defeat Gram's Phantom by destroying the Phantom Crystals!|

23259|Enter the Magic Circle of Light to obtain the Blessing of Light.|
23260|The Blessing of Light can help you to break this evil force!|
23261|Suddenly, the Phantoms freeze and begin to disappear.|
23262|The Orb glows again, and the Phantoms reappear.|
23263|Bealdor appeared in front of Hel and confronted the Thorny Flower Fairies.|
23264|Suddenly, out of nowhere, Gram's Phantom appeared.|
23265|The Orb glowed again, and the phantoms of Hel and Bealdor appeared.|
23266|Once the words were uttered, Hel's Phantom appeared before you.|
23267|The Orb glowed again, and numerous phantoms appeared.|
23268|Hel and Gram appeared, locked in battle.|
23269|With Bealdor's departure, all the other phantoms began to dissapear.|
23270|In their place, glowing Glimmers appeared.|
23271|The Orb continued to glow, and Bealdor's Phantom reappeared.|
23272|After the conversation, Hel's Phantom disappeared and Bealdor's Phantom appeared.|
23273|The Orb kept glowing and spinning, telling the unfinished tale.|
23274|Hel and Bealdor stood and stared at each other, as Gram transformed into a sword between them.|

23283|Bealdor came to this place, overgrown with Umbras, to find the Light of Dawn.|
23284|From deep within the Umbras, a light shines in the darkness. This is the light Bealdor spoke of.|
23285|Someone must enter Glimmering Collection Circle and gain Glimmer Collector's Power, then use it to bring the Glimmers back.|
23286|With Glimmer Collector's Power, you can bring Glimmers back to Glimmering Collection Circle.|
23287|With Glimmer Collector's Power, you can protect Glimmer Collectors from their concentrated attacks.|
23288|Power of Dawn gives you the ability to destroy Umbras. When an Umbra is destroyed, you have a chance of capturing a Glimmer.|

23301|Hel used the Power of Storm to summon Storm Hel.|
23302|Hel used the Power of Flame to summon Flame Hel.|
23303|Hel used the Power of Ice to summon Ice Hel.|
23304|As the phantoms begin to disappear, Hel herself comes to battle!|
23305|Solder: I feel so much better, thank you!|
23306|Glimmers will perform energy attacks on their carriers. Acquire Glimmer Protector's Power to keep Glimmer Collectors safe.|
23307|Glimmers are hiding among the Umbras. Acquire Power of Dawn to dispel the Umbras.|
23308|Meteors are raining from the sky - look out!|
23309|After all the Glimmers merged, Light of Dawn appeared.|
23310|You have been targeted by a Snowy Shadow. Dodge his attack!|
23311|You have been targeted by a Flaming Shadow. Dodge his attack!|
23312|Let Hel touch the Orbs, then defeat the phantoms she summons.|
23313|Corrupted by Dark Energy, the power of Divine Light has been weakened.|
23314|Kali: First, I'll need some Bug Eggs.|
23315|Kali: First, I'll need some Mushrooms.|
23316|Kali: First, I'll need some Beer Powder.|
23317|Kali: First, I'll need an Orchid.|
23318|Kali: First, I'll need some Crocodile Organs.|
23319|Kali: Next, I'll need a Snake Egg.|
23320|Kali: Next, I'll need several Red Stamens.|
23321|Kali: Next, I'll need several Cabbage Leaves.|
23322|Kali: Next, I'll need a Skullcap.|
23323|Kali: Next, I'll need a bottle of Lizard Saliva.|
23324|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Sakura Coral.|
23325|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Forest Land Crab.|
23326|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Crystal Fragment.|
23327|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Seashell.|
23328|Kali: Finally, I'll need Werewolf Nails.|
23329|Kali: Great! You used the correct ingredients; now we can proceed...|
23330|Kali: Oh no! What have you done? You used the wrong ingredients!|
23331|Kali: This type of Bug Egg contains a substance that heals injuries.|
23332|Kali: Mushrooms are very nutritious, and very helpful for healing injuries.|
23333|Kali: Beer Powder... surprised? It helps with the absorption of the other ingredients.|
23334|Kali: Orchids are rich in iron, which helps blood circulation.|
23335|Kali: This type of Crocodile is very effective at healing itself, and its organs are the source of this power.|
23336|Kali: Snake Eggs secrete protein prior to hatching, which makes them excellent catalysts.|
23337|Kali: Sometimes, when two materials won't react, Red Stamens can make a reaction happen.|
23338|Kali: Cabbage Leaf... looks normal, right? Now you know its real value!|
23339|Kali: Skullcaps contain many useful substances. It's a bit of a waste to use them as activators, but it's very effective.|
23340|Kali: The enzymes in Lizard Saliva can bring out the hidden effects of certain ingredients... makes sense, right?|
23341|Kali: Sakura Coral keeps the potion from being absorbed too quickly during digestion.|
23342|Kali: Forest Land Crab has numerous medical properties. Nearly every part of it can be used in potions.|
23343|Kali: The molecular structure of this type of Crystal is very stable, and will help the potion interact with the body's immune system.|
23344|Kali: This type of Seashell evolved over millennia. Its genetic material is very unique.|
23345|Kali: This... it may seem disgusting, but it's a very effective ingredient.|
23346|Kali: Great! The potion is done!|
23347|Kali: Are you ready? Then let's start blending it.|
23348|You place the impaled Sea Monster Corpse in the middle of the battlefield. Immediately, the nearby Sarpa are shocked and terrified.|
23349|Kali: Ah! The ingredients for the third stage have been added correctly. Let's see what we have...|
23350|A strange sound emanates from within the Whirlpool Abyss.|
23351|A huge, shadowy figure begins to rise from the bottom of the Whirlpool Abyss.|
23352|A massive creature surfaces in the Whirlpool Abyss. This must be Nazrudin, the legendary Great Leviathan!|
23353|Summoning Nazrudin has made him furious. He leaves the Whirlpool Abyss and makes his way ashore!|
23354|Open the Sentry Commands and answer the Sentry Captain to obtain the Battlefield Report.|
23355|Go to the Myriad Tombs, look for the Nameless Tombstones, find the Runic Ghosts inside and eliminate them.|
23356|Use the Magic Circles to bounce over the Ice Boars and eliminate the Ghostspinners at (552, 285).|
23357|Rescue Frostbitten Sailor|
23358|Grab a torch from camp and warm up the Frostbitten Catseye Sailors.|
23359|Obtain Draconic Essences from Crystal Dragon Pillar and Crystal Dragon Devourer at the Great Seal, then destroy them.|
23360|Intercept the Icehoof Blitzers on the road near Soldier Henry.|
23361|Investigate the Draconic Essence in the village and eliminate the Frosty Abominations.|
23362|Talk to the Dwarven Craftsman and defeat the Robotic Vehicle.|
23363|Intervene in the dispute between the Dwarves.|
23364|Camilla: There are some medical tools in the First-aid Kit. Use different tools for different occasions.|
23365|Still preparing...|
23366|Still preparing...|
23367|You added numerous layers of wood to the Broken Barricade to strengthen it.|
23368|When you finish nailing the wood to the Barricade, you survey the battlefield. You have the distinct feeling you might need to repair the Barricade again soon.|
23369|After attaching the wood, you examine the Barricade. It's not as strong as it once was, but it should work.|
23370|Looking at the wood in your hands, you wonder how much you'll have to carry by the battle's end.|
23371|Ouch! You hammered your finger!|
23372|After hearing Baird's report, you decide to go to Lion's Roar Stronghold to join the battle.|
23373|After hearing Kara's report, you decide to go to Joint Operation Camp to join the battle.|
23374|After hearing Chaim's report, you decide to go to the front lines with Anya to learn more about the situation.|
23375|After receiving updated information about the wounded from Camilla, you set out to help treat them.|
23376|These supplies must be immediately sent to Lion's Roar Stronghold, the volunteer encampment, and the assault force in Drowsy Glen.|
23377|There is a great deal of scrap metal on the battlefield. Stay sharp as you collect it!|
23378|Try to defeat the Black Tooth Army Base now that the Lion's Roar Stronghold has them surrounded. Support Shalen, who is stationed in Black Tooth Mountain.|
23379|Guard the Supply Wagon well - we're counting on it!|
23380|Eliminate all enemies, and plant the Alliance Flag in Black Tooth City!|
23381|The Lion's Roar Army's strategy was a success! Report back to Baird so he can deploy soldiers effectively.|
23382|Find wood nearby and use it to repair the Broken Barricade.|
23383|Tanner and Amon are attacking Toxic Fortress. Help them!|
23384|The Sarpa Warpriest has summoned a terrifying Deepsea Monstrosity. Kill it before it kills you!|
23385|The strategy was a success! Summon everyone back to the camp so the Alliance can bombard the enemy.|
23386|According to the battle plan, you must read the report from Anya and Hermione to receive your next order.|
23387|Note: airborne battle time is limited! Use Glide and follow the Flight Path to flank your enemies.|
23388|You must destroy the Dark Gate to keep the Dark Legion from passing through it.|
23389|Find and eliminate the Scourge Artillery in the Dark Legion Base.|
23390|Time to break through. Bomb the enemy's most important sites!|
23391|Although the Dark Gate was repaired, we gained some intel. Bring it back to Chaim.|
23392|To help the Alliance with their new Chipper, go to the Logging Camp in the Southeast.|
23393|Carrion Barrier|
23394|Black Tooth Mountain|
23395|Drowsy Glen|
23396|The Dark Legion|
23397|Aerial Base|
23398|Lion's Roar Stronghold|
23399|Toxic Fortress|
23400|Joint Operation Camp|
23401|Alliance Logging Camp|
23402|You raise the Alliance Flag. As it flutters in the wind, your heart swells with pride.|
23403|All of a sudden, a deep voice shakes the earth...|
23404|Horsemen of War: Kill... Let the earth be stained with blood...|
23405|Three Fallen Angels descend from the sky, flapping their black wings.|
23406|Horsemen of War: Let him be released... None shall survive!|
23407|In the name of God, release the imprisoned Banoleth!|
23408|The three Fallen Angels begin to chant the dark words together.|
23409|Banoleth: After millions of years, I am free of my shackles! My enemies will drown in a lake of fire!|
23410|Anya: Look out! Banoleth has been released - get ready to fight!|
23411|After an intense battle, Banoleth lies in a pool of blood. The deep voice begins speaking again...|
23412|Horsemen of War: Keep fighting... Feast on the blood of your enemies...|
23413|Horsemen of War: I will walk among you as you battle...|
23414|Horsemen of War: Wait... for death...|
23415|Eternal Wisdom Elder, the Fish King of Vulture's Vale, has appeared. Challenge him if you dare!|
23416|Nazrudin has appeared in the vicinity of Whirlpool Abyss (420, 386). Go destroy him!|
23417|Warlord Claret and Periwinkle roar in anger. Get ready to fight!|
23418|Pick up the torch.|
23419|Abandoned Frost Crystal Mine entrance|
23420|Floating Magic Circle|
23421|Escape from Magic Circle|
23422|You're stuck in the ice coffin. Quick, use Desperate Punch to escape!|
23423|I wanted to try out my acting skills a bit more, but it seems nobody is interested... What do you say?|
23424|Alright, then... let's try out a scene...|
23425|This chapter is called "The Stupid Envoy of Gaia is Doomed." Isn't it great?|
23426|Let's get started!|
23427|Just when you thought Argus was defeated, his body began to flash rapidly.|
23428|The air around you grows cold. Suddenly, Argus reappears before you.|
23429|A single phantom made of dragon scale makes everyone so worried... wow...|
23430|I'd love to keep playing with you, but I have more important things to do.|
23431|Follow me and I'll show you what I can do!|
23432|Argus scoffed, and immediately disappeared behind the seal.|
23433|Argus is about to release the Aqua-Dragon Queen! Quick, stop him!|
23434|When you tried to come here, the mountain around me seemed to be crying.|
23435|Argus begins to speak Draconic, and the whole cave starts shaking violently.|
23436|As Argus speaks more rapidly, the air around the huge Stone Tablet begins to freeze.|
23437|Suddenly, waterspouts spring from the ground, and a dragon's roar echoes through the cave.|
23438|The huge Monument Seal is crushed by Argus's power.|
23439|A massive figure appears... the legendary Aqua-Dragon Queen, Lianne Riverwalker.|
23440|Argus smiled maliciously and spoke to the Aqua-Dragon Queen.|
23441|Uhh... the potion did taste a bit strange, but I don't feel anything yet...|
23442|Ahh! My body is burning!|
23443|Urgh... I'm gonna throw up...|
23444|Where am I? Who are you? Get away from me!|
23445|I feel so much better, thank you!|
23446|You guessed wrong! Now receive the curse of the Treasure Chest!|
23447|You've captured <Cruel Poacher>Beyeta! Pick up the egg and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23448|You've captured <Deadly Seed>Darlak! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23449|You've captured <Listener>Michelle! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23450|You've captured <Giant Horn>Dinglebert! Pick up the crate and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23451|You've captured <Flesh Ripper>Marco! Pick up the egg and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23452|You've captured <Axe Raider>Zagon! Pick up the crate and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23453|You've captured <Spiked Spine>Rumeon! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23454|You've captured <Flesh Ripper>Marco! Pick up the egg and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23455|There appears to be a strange mound up ahead. We must remain vigilant...|
23456|The Aqua-Dragon Queen mutters and looks at you sadly.|
23457|You hear a gentle voice inside your head...|
23458|Lianne: I'm sorry... please forgive me... it wasn't my choice...|
23459|The massive body of Lianne Riverwalker crashes to the ground, and Von explodes in anger.|
23460|Suddenly, two floating lights appear next to you. Two figures emerge from the light.|
23461|As Taloc whispers, the Aqua-Dragon Queen changes into her human form.|
23462|Argus's arrogant laughter fades away.|
23463|The three of them disappear, leaving you with more questions than answers.|
23464|It seems this ancient grudge might not be resolved until next time.|
23465|You're surrounded! Fight them off and keep pressing forward!|
23466|You feel unwelcome in this place, and sense an unsettling air of hostility.|
23467|You found the thief!|
23468|Fenrir is hungry and starts to attack!|
23469|Fenrir ate the fresh food and grew stronger!|
23470|Fenrir ate the spoiled food and grew weaker!|
23471|Torian's food is scattered all over. Prevent Fenrir from eating it!|
23472|The food is rotten and stinks to high heaven. Keep your distance!|
23473|Predictably, he then fled the scene!|
23474|Some of the food seems to be going bad. You should eat it up before it's rotten.|
23475|Some of the food has been left out too long. One can hardly recognize...|
23476|The wine barrel breaks and dream wine spills forth, forming a puddle.|
23477|Reserved|
23478|Reserved|
23479|Reserved|
23480|Reserved|
23481|The Lightning Magnet is fully charged. It's about to explode!|
23482|Fenrir is covered in electricity. Quick, find the Lightning Magnet!|
23483|You arrived just in time! Give the package to McKinley.|
23484|Quest failed - you took too long. (Abandon Quest and try again.)|
23485|The phantom slowly disappears, and the forest begins to show itself.|
23486|The Phantom Orb glows softly, revealing Torian and Fenrir gazing at each other.  |
23487|Scenes from the dream appear in the mist, visible to all.|
23488|The Phantom Orb glows softly, and Torian and Fenrir appear to be asleep again.|
23489|The jar of liquor has been opened, releasing an intoxicating cloud.|
23490|The Orb starts to shine again. You can see many drunk Bunnyhops lying around the jar.|
23491|After these words are spoken, Fenrir's phantom materializes.|
23492|Fenrir's drunken apparition appears on the scene again, surrounded by a large number of guards.|
23493|After these words are spoken, Torian's phantom materializes.|
23494|The Phantom Orb glows softly, and Torian's phantom reappears. |
23495|A cute Bunnyhop pokes its head out of the grass. You wave at the Bunnyhop, and it bounces over to you.|
23496|Sunny is not here - try looking for him somewhere else.|
23497|It's the Purple Meadow Carol was talking about.|
23498|Fenrir stands open-mouthed, looking innocently at Torian.|
23499|Torian puts away the Great Axe, and switches to Dual Blades.|
23500|Torian attaches the Dual Blades to his waist, and switches back to the Great Axe.|
23501|Torian has summoned Wild Oxen to his aid. Quick, get out of their way!|
23502|Torian has locked onto you. Carefully lead him away from the others.|
23503|The pots in each corner start boiling - each will have a different fortifying effect for Torian.|
23504|A Crescent Sprite appears in the grass. She doesn't seem very happy about being disturbed.|
23505|McKinley: I slept like a log - now it's time to get something to eat...|
23506|Happy to have finally found the right person, you ask him to accompany you back to meet Autumn.|
23507|Suddenly, a ghostly-looking Old Mage approaches you.|
23508|You open the box carefully, revealing a heavy book.|
23509|You unseal the Magic Book with an Unsealing Incantation.|
23510|A fiercely hot barrier of magical flames surrounds the Magic Book.|
23511|Once the magical flames are out, you go to put Dirk's book in your Backpack.|
23512|Before unsealing the grimoire, your curiosity gets the best of you, and you glance at it quickly.|
23513|It appears to be Dirk's sketchbook, filled with fantastical, heroic images.|
23514|The Soul Gem glows faintly. The person you seek should be close.|
23515|The Soul Gem glows warmly. The person you seek should be close.|
23516|The Soul Gem glows powerfully. The person you seek should be close.|
23517|The Soul Gem emits brilliant rays of light as you stand before the man. It appears he has great potential.|
23518|After handing the package to you, Felix starts out on his longer route.|
23519|Felix thanks you, and leaves for town carrying a backpack.|
23520|The Magic Snail reacts quickly to the magic substance. Quick, follow it!|
23521|The Magic Snail seems to have found something. Use your Shovel to investigate.|
23522|You've found the magic substance! Put it in your Backpack and take it to the Biologist.|
23523|After securing the Tiny Mushroom, you notice it doesn't smell very good. You'd better not give it to Shelton like this.|
23524|It might be best if you washed it in the Waterfall east of Mushroom Village before bringing it to Shelton.|
23525|The Tiny Mushroom is much cleaner after being washed.|
23526|It's time to take the Tiny Mushroom to Shelton near the square of Mushroom Village.|
23527|After praying for her life, Kathy zips off like a dart.|
23528|There are many foxes in the Haunted Passage. Explore the area with the fox to see if you can find any clues about its family.|
23529|"Ahhhh!" Strange noises come from the northwest.|
23530|Gripping her sword tightly, Lyla follows Ebazon, and steps out of sight.|
23531|"Ahhhh!" Strange noises come from off in the distance.|
23532|"Ahhhh!" Strange noises come from off in the distance. The sounds come from far off in the northwest. Could it be the fox's family?|
23533|The fox bounds over happily - he seems to have found his family!|
23534|The fox looks happy, but they all sound different...|
23535|Anyway, the fox and his family were reunited. Congratulations!|
23536|You hand the spores to the rabbit near the fire, and it hops with joy.|
23537|You hand the spores to the other rabbits, and they hop happily as well.|
23538|The rabbit trying to warm itself steps closer to the fire...|
23539|... and trips on a stick.|
23540|All the rabbit's spores fall into the fire!|
23541|The fire explodes into a full-blown conflagration!|
23542|The rabbits were frightened by the explosion and ran off.|
23543|Proudmoore was overcome with grief, and turned into a raging spirit.|
23544|You may be able to help Proudmoore by finding the Counter Magic Grimoire he was talking about.|
23545|The Counter Magic Grimoire seems to be hidden somewhere in the Avian Laboratory.|
23546|Proudmoore, now in mastery of the counterspell, defeated Uray.|
23547|His soul finally at peace, Proudmoore fades from sight.|
23548|After talking, Ebazon leaves in a hurry.|
23549|First find <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Ken so as not to alarm anyone.|
23550|There seems to be a commotion to your left. Go check it out!|
23551|Something is happening, wait and see...|
23552|Be careful not to alert the Marauders, or the captives will be in danger.|
23553|Talk to <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Sokka for an update.|
23554|You can hear the sounds of people and wagons up ahead...|
23555|The Investigation Squad has engaged the enemy - head back and support them!|
23556|The enemy base is up ahead - make sure you aren't spotted.|
23557|A shadowy figure emerges from the tunnel, howling with anger.|
23558|It's <Guard Captain> Drago! The destruction of the supply wagons has made him furious!|
23559|Defeat <Guard Captain> Drago!|
23560|Talk to <Investigation Team Lieutenant> Mandon to get the torch.|
23561|More haystacks need to be lit - keep going!|
23562|An enraged figure storms from the darkness of the tent...|
23563|Everyone, listen to my plan for the arson attacks...|
23564|There are no storehouses nearby - find a better place to set a fire. |
23565|Timantha has already asked the staff to help her set up.|
23566|The Forest Tanuki was drawn to the smell of the campfire.|
23567|The Forest Tanuki has grown tired of playing and gone home.|
23568|The bonfire has already gone out. The feast is over.|
23569|Place the detector north of Emerald Town|
23570|Place the detector south of Emerald Town|
23571|Used Aqua Iguana Bait|
23572|Investigate the area south of the marsh|
23573|Stoneback Otter Captured|
23574|All Mines Cleared|
23575|Attack Mission Complete|
23576|Drone Patrol Reprogrammed|
23577|Close the Dimensional Fissure|
23578|Machine Gun Turret Installed|
23579|Felwood Opened|
23580|Use the Interfering Transmitter to disable the Drone Patrols|
23581|The Marauders have put out the burning haystacks. Light them again!|
23582|Ah?! (Where am I?)|
23583|Aaaaoooo! (I'm so hungry...)|
23584|In Fenrir's dream, he was so hungry that he had to scavenge for food.|
23585|If he gets hungry enough, he'll start eating people!|
23586|Fenrir will recover his full HP every time he bites a target.|
23587|Torian is upset because, in his dream, he's forgotten how to cook.|
23588|If left unchecked, his emotions will explode.|
23589|They must be destroyed before they cause any harm...|
23590|Please, try this food!|
23591|How... how can this be? I've never made this sort of mistake before...|
23592|This is my signature dish! How could I mess it up so badly?|
23593|No way! I must've made this a hundred times! This is impossible!|
23594|I must have been cursed...|
23595|This crocodile meat tastes like soap!|
23596|Gah! Why are there only stems in this stew?|
23597|Ahhh! It's so salty! Someone bring me some water, quick!|
23598|It's completely tasteless... didn't you add any salt?|
23599|Fish scales! So many fish scales!|
23600|Worms! Ewww!|
23601|Ah! Sharp bones! My tongue!|
23602|Why does this grilled escargot taste sweet...|
23603|It's overcooked and tough as a board!|
23604|Are you sure this is Dragon Leg Stew and not plaster stew?|
23605|Ack! Terrible!|
23606|Disgusting!|
23607|Daisy is waving as if she has something to tell you.|
23608|Go check on her.|
23609|You set up the detector and turn it on.|
23610|The detector emits a signal, and you spot an Ebon Drake nearby.|
23611|Even though the Drakes are still a ways away, you should still let Zachary know.|
23612|You set the detector up near the water, and turn it on.|
23613|The detector emits a signal - it appears to be working.|
23614|You set out the bait, and hide in a nearby bush.|
23615|An Emerald Iguana approaches, attracted by the smell.|
23616|It smells the food in the bag...|
23617|...and begins to feast.|
23618|Soon, more Emerald Iguanas appear.|
23619|They start to fight chaotically over the food.|
23620|It appears you've successfully distracted them.|
23621|Come back when their numbers decrease.|
23622|You have defeated the Karok Sorceress.|
23623|You say that it's useless to fight back, since all the Dark Gremlins have been defeated.|
23624|The Karok Sorceress appears to have made up her mind.|
23625|She drinks all the potion in the bottle.|
23626|She starts to transform, and a cloud of black mist surrounds her.|
23627|The black mist clears, and the sorceress has been transformed into a monster!|
23628|Karok Sorceress: Aaaaaaah!|
23629|Monstrous Karok Sorceress defeated.|
23630|You set down the crate containing the robot, and open it.|
23631|The robot walks out.|
23632|Robot: BEEP! Powering on.|
23633|Robot: Detecting swamp.|
23634|You feel a faint vibration.|
23635|Suddenly, the robot explodes!|
23636|There's something fishy going on - you should definitely report back to Pierre.|
23637|You insert the virus chip into the drone.|
23638|The robot makes disturbing sounds, and appears to be in a state of chaos.|
23639|Acey immediately takes out an adapter, and reprograms the drone.|
23640|Acey: Reprogramming success! This is now our drone patrol.|
23641|Acey: Let's get out of here before someone finds out...|
23642|Return and tell Abu that the drone has been reprogrammed.|
23643|Totem Pillar lit.|
23644|Black smoke pours from the Totem Pillar.|
23645|Return to Quincy and tell him about the burnt Totem.|
23646|You put down the box.|
23647|The Machine Gun Turret springs into activation.|
23648|Drone Patrol alerted.|
23649|You and Geno return to Emerald Village with the refugees. |
23650|You report back about Slim Sye's escape with the Scepter of Resurrection,
as well as the Gnome of Karok and the Dark Gremlin Egg.|
23651|It seems that Slim Sye is dead!|
23652|Prepare to fight the Gigantic Otter!|
23653|You watch from a nearby bush after setting the bait.|
23654|An Aqua Iguana approaches cautiously.|
23655|Talk to <Investigation Team Lieutenant> Erlar for an update.|
23656|Wait for the mole to arrive so that you can enter together.|
23657|You're too far away from your team! Learn to fight as one!|
23658|<Mage Commander> Barr appears!|
23659|Defeat <Mage Commander> Barr!|
23660|You hear voices from up ahead.|
23661|Fenrir woke up! And he's ravenously hungry!|
23662|It's still frightened and begins looking around for Torian.|
23663|Fenrir finds Torian, but Torian is still asleep! Something's wrong!|
23664|Fenrir runs to wake Torian up.|
23665|Torian's negative emotions swirl into a massive, seething nightmare!!|
23666|The nightmare is destroyed, but Torian remains asleep. Perhaps he needs one final wake-up call...|
23667|Destroy it and help Torian be rid of his nightmare for good!|
23668|The nightmare grows ever stronger. Now two negative emotions writhe and moan within it.|
23669|Quickly, destroy them both before they multiply again!|
23670|You'll find it where the resurrection is to be held. Hurry and destroy it! |

23683|Smuggler's Cabin|
23684|Cadilla Ruins|
23685|Cadilla Felwood|
23686|You fill the Alchemy Bottle with Holy Water and bring it back to Rollena in the Smuggler's Cabin.|
23687|You defeat the otter and find a Fried Meatball.|
23688|You loot a corpse on the side of the road.|
23689|You find a soldier's Dog Tag, but the name is too faint to read.|
23690|A chill runs up your spine and you turn around to check for tails.|
23691|You report what you saw and the lack of ghosts to Alf.|
23692|Alf runs off screaming after his exorcism fails. |
23693|The ghost leaves after losing interest.|
23694|The various parts buried beneath the banner activate and begin transforming into a robot.|
23695|The robot completes its transformation fortified with the parts you gave it.|
23696|Something appears in the Glimmering Air. |
23697|The elf is purified and beautiful once more after using the Purity Powder.|
23698|The pollution causes the elf to mutate into a vicious beast! Defeat it and save the elf!|
23699|You read aloud the Sacred Prayer and a Magic Circle forms to purify the dead spirit.|
23700|You've successfully purified three dead spirits! Good job! Now the mage's work will be easier.|
23701|There are two demons in the cave. This must be the final trial that Aquila spoke of.|
23702|After defeating the demons, you are suddenly trapped by vines that spring from the ground!|
23703|A teleportation gateway has appeared in front of you! Ruth emerges from the gateway.|
23704|You try in vain to break free from the vines.|
23705|Ruth walks towards you, eyeing you hungrily!|
23706|She waves her hand, and a second Ruth suddenly appears before you.|
23707|When she leaves, the vines holding you in place also disappear.|
23708|The Shadow Knight's Elite Four were right in front of you! You have to let Aquila know about this as soon as possible!|
23709|You've destroyed five cars! Keep it up, you wrecking ball!|
23710|You've destroyed ten cars! You've got this, you master of smash!|
23711|You've destroyed fifteen cars! You're on fire! Go, go, go!|
23712|You've defeated five summoners! You are the meaning of chaos!|
23713|You've defeated ten summoners! Now the ceremony is really in trouble!|
23714|You've defeated fifteen summoners! They might as well stop the ceremony now!|
23715|Turbine Settlement Southwest Waterfall|
23716|East of Waterweed Wetland|
23717|South of Waterweed Wetland|
23718|Urazi shouts: "Medics, I want you collecting Windsoul Grass!"|
23719|Urazi shouts: "Guards, kill anything from Navea!"|
23720|Bruce: "We need Medicinal Herbs. Collect as many as you can while we distract the guards."|
23721|Urazi: "As if we could be taken down by the likes of Navean riffraff! Die, filth!"|
23722|Keep the medics from collecting Windsoul Grass by nabbing them first.|
23723|It sniffs the bag curiously, then bites into it.|
23724|The smell of blood wafts out of the bag.|
23725|Aqua Iguanas catch a whiff of the smell and begin moseying over.|
23726|The Aqua Iguanas begin fighting over the food.|
23727|Even the Aqua Iguana Boss joins the frenzy.|
23728|It seems like every single Aqua Iguana is now in the jumbled pandemonium in front of you.|
23729|The sight and smell is absolutely disgusting!|
23730|Report to Ronny when you're finished.|
23731|You follow the Sorceress for a while.|
23732|Several soldiers join the chase and you finally corner the Sorceress.|
23733|Sorceress: Almighty God... Please hear the wishes of your humble servant... |
23734|Sorceress: I give my life unto you in order to vanquish this enemy!|
23735|She quickly gulps something down.|
23736|A strange aura engulfs the Sorceress.|
23737|The Sorceress's form begins mutating...|
23738|Once the mists settle, the Sorceress's new form can be seen - a hideous, crazed beast!|
23739|Metamorphosed Sorceress: Kill...! KILL!|
23740|The Sorceress has gone mad! Getting any information out of her now would be a fool's errand.|
23741|You've got to take her out!|
23742|Defeat the Metamorphosed Sorceress!|
23743|You quickly scan the environs and decide this must be the place.|
23744|You carefully open the box and let out the robot.|
23745|BEEP! Initiate exploration protocol. Start investigation.|
23746|The robot slowly turns to the right.|
23747|Robot: BEEP! Investigating target...|
23748|Robot: Assorted scrap metal... no recyclable value...|
23749|It turns left towards another heap of scraps.|
23750|Robot: Assorted wood scraps... no usage whatsoever...|
23751|The robot suddenly stops and moves towards the middle of the area as if it's found something.|
23752|The ground shakes, and a beam of light shoots up towards the sky.|
23753|The Transforming Robot explodes and falls to pieces.|
23754|The robot's broken shell is partially melted from the astronomically high temperatures.|
23755|Report back to Pierre to see if he has any idea what's going on.|
23756|You leave quickly while the Aqua Iguanas are still fighting over the food.|
23757|You let out a sigh as you gaze down at the Karok Sorceress's body.|
23758|All you can do is tell Geno what happened.|
23759|Hurry back to the cart you're supposed to destroy!|
23760|Patrols are discussing the plans for their supply raid.|
23761|If you don't stay back, you might compromise the mole's identity.|
23762|The mushrooms in the area have been corrupted by the pollution, and attack anything they see.|
23763|Guard: "Blast! Fall back, men!"|
23764|Guards! Take them down! None shall escape!|
23765|Kill the summoners to prevent the resurrection of the Immemorial Beast! |
23766|Wonderful! The ceremony has been brought to a screeching halt!|
23767|Complete Cave of Trials|
23768|Quick! <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Bruce is waiting for you! Find him at once!|
23769|The Bonfire Feast has already started. Hurry to the Guild Hall.|
23770|Some kind of explosive must have caused this. |
23771|Defeat the Metamorphosed Sorceress before you leave!|
23772|Look at the robots, though... the investigation isn't over!|
23773|Sokka: Leave this here with us! You have our thanks.|
23774|<Investigation Team Captain> Griffin is just up ahead. Hurry!|
23775|Ask <Investigation Team Captain> Griffin about the current situation.|
23776|The barricades are down. Take out the enemy's frontlines! |
23777|You hear footsteps nearby.|
23778|Jessia: "We'll try to hold back the rest of the enemies while you take out the Energy Pillars!"|
23779|Jessia: "But those blasted things can repair themselves if they're not all destroyed within a five-second window."|
23780|Jessia: "The only way to take them out is to destroy them all as fast as possible."|
23781|Jessia: "That'll take out the Energy Furnace as well."|
23782|Badam: "You think you can just destroy the Energy Furnace? Don't make me laugh! I'll see you all in hell before I let you near that furnace!"|
23783|The Energy Pillars were not destroyed within five seconds. They have now repaired themselves.|
23784|The Energy Pillars have been destroyed, and the Energy Furnace has stopped!|
23785|Quick! <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Bruce is waiting for you! Find him at once!|
23786|You take the Energy Leaf Hookah out of the box with a puff of smoke.|
23787|The injured soldier seems to have recovered after breathing in the vapor.|
23788|The snail seems to sense something and moves forward.|
23789|The snail moves underground. It seems as though the Seal Sprout is the source of the magic interference.|
23790|It sounds like a brawl up ahead! You'd better go check it out.|
23791|Suddenly, an explosion wracks your ears. You don't know what happened.|
23792|You're able to concoct the antidote on your way back.|
23793|You make it back to the Mushroom Village safely and give both Caresha and the Mage the antidote.|
23794|Everyone recovers from the charm thanks to the antidote.|
23795|A patient needs your help - go with Medic Zoy.|
23796|You sprinkle the Ghostly Dew in front of you, and the ghosts disappear.|
23797|You capture the Magic Town Wizard and hand him over to Odum.|
23798|You take the Avian Artifact from Odum and head over to Maya.|
23799|You release the snails just as Caresha told you to.|
23800|After defeating the Colorful Winged Fairy, use the kettle to collect the Butterfly Fairy Dew.|
23801|Use the Enhanced Glyphed Shackles on Shawn.|
23802|Shawn is free! But he's weakened - quick, defeat him!|
23803|You've defeated Shawn. Take him back to Brook for questioning. |
23804|The Fire Wall disappeared thanks to the enemy's retreat. Keep the pressure on them!|
23805|Try and catch Karok Sorceress Amos.|
23806|Watch out! A big otter appears from behind the bushes.|
23807|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'Cadilla Ruins.'"|
23808|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'Smuggler's Cabin.'"|
23809|First, find <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Ken for information on the kidnapped miners.|
23810|You defeat <Guard Captain> Gheit and save the remaining captives for a successful mission!|
23811|The miners are fighting against the marauders! You must help them!|
23812|This is one of the marauders' warehouses where they keep their food.|
23813|There's a haystack out front. Why not try lighting it up?|
23814|Mandon hands you a torch.|
23815|Success! <Granary Commander> Karter has been vanquished thanks to everyone's efforts.|
23816|A shout comes from afar: What's going on here!?|
23817|Follow the instructions to place the combustibles. Once ignited, there will be a huge explosion!|
23818|Ignite the combustibles using the Torch. Remember, safety first!|
23819|<Guard Captain> Drago is defeated and the enemy's storage has been destroyed for a successful mission!|
23820|A shout comes from afar: Don't let them get away! C'mon, men!|
23821|Enemy soldiers come charging into the bedlam.|
23822|Good job! You've collected five blades of Windsoul Grass! Don't stop now!|
23823|You've collected eight blades of Windsoul Grass! Only two more to go!|
23824|Windsoul Grass is a medicinal herb. Help the Naveans by collecting as much as you can before the enemy does.|
23825|Help the Naveans destroy the enemy's Energy Furnace and keep them from making more weapons.|
23826|The resurrection is about to begin. Hurry, Erlar is waiting for you.|
23827|<Mage Commander> Barr has been defeated and a wrench has been thrown in the resurrection. A job well done!|
23828|<Medic Captain> Urazi has been defeated and the enemy's medical team has been stopped for good!|
23829|<Armory Manager> Badam has been defeated and the Energy Furnace is history!|
23830|Head east to Fel Town where you'll find Robinson and his scouts.|
23831|Replace Alex and question suspects in the Haunted Passage.|
23832|Head southwest to the Avian Laboratory where you might find some suspects.|
23833|Head west towards Cobweb Forest and meet up with Bessie and Ronny.|
23834|Meet Geno in the Cobweb Forest after you've defeated the Drone Patrol. |
23835|Carrick needs immediate assistance in the outskirts of the Turbine Settlement! Destroy Ebon Drake and then meet him ASAP!|
23836|Follow the escaped chief's footsteps over the waterfall to investigate, then meet up with Acey in the Waterweed Wetlands.|
23837|A great battle took place here. Many were wounded or killed.|
23838|The beast that guards this place seems to be a general. He must be defeated before you can pass.|
23839|Watch out! That supply cart is on fire! No need for human barbeque!|
23840|Another general is blocking your path. You'll need to defeat him!|
23841|You hear a multitude of marauder soldiers talking inside.|
23842|The enemy soldiers dare to stand in your way! Take them out!|
23843|Now the Marauder Chief has joined the brawl. Take him out to end this fight for good.|
23844|<Marauder Chief> Lasas has been defeated! At long last, the war has come to an end.|
23845|Kuba: "This is my territory - don't expect to make it out alive!"|
23846|Garnett: "Puny humans! You'll learn just how weak you are!"|
23847|Lasas: "You think you can prevent us from conquering this land?"|
23848|Mole: Okay, this is the place. My mission is complete!|
23849|I'll leave sabotaging the ceremony to you guys...|
23850|The explosives are wet and can't be lit.|
23851|Barr: You dare interrupt our ceremony? Prepare to die!|
23852|Barr: Get over here!|
23853|The burning haystacks are making it hard to breathe.|
23854|You choke on the thick smoke from the burning haystacks. |
23855|Unconscious soldiers are strewn everywhere. It appears to be Alex's third squad.|
23856|There's a suspicious shadow ahead - perhaps it's what knocked out the soldiers!|
23857|Upon entering, you discover that numerous Mages are casting spells on the Titan Mushroom.|
23858|At Titan's Root, you find Odum and Alex's troops.|
23859|They've set up a temporary camp and appear ready to launch an attack.|
23860|The mushrooms here are very unusual-looking.|
23861|You sense a strong being... stronger than the ones you just fought.|
23862|Mushroom Titan: Intruders! Leave Titan at once!|
23863|Alex: We'll deal with this. You're pretty quick on your feet. Hurry and find the Second Prince.|
23864|You sense radiating waves of magic ahead. Perhaps the Second Prince is there.|
23865|Magic energy pulsates strongly. You see the second prince, tied up on the altar. |
23866|You feel the energy from the altar washing over you. You know you must now face...|
23867|"Agh! More rats have found their way in here, eh?" |
23868|"I'll just have to take care of you myself!"|
23869|The Winged Duke's power suddenly drops, freeing the Second Prince.|
23870|Odum and Alex have arrived!|
23871|Suddenly, the Winged Duke casts a spell that draws out the souls of nearby soldiers.|
23872|The Winged Duke disappears in a cloud of black smoke and transports to Titan's Root, cloaked in darkness.|
23873|The space ahead gives you an uneasy feeling... much like when you encountered the Charm Queen.|
23874|Suddenly, a swarm of Canyon Crawlers emerges from the ground and surrounds you!|
23875|"Hee hee... hello again!"|
23876|"I hadn't seen you for awhile - I was getting worried!"|
23877|Perhaps together you can overcome the Charm Queen.|
23878|"Charm Queen...!"|
23879|The Second Prince approaches the Charm Queen, seething with anger.|
23880|"Ruth! Is that all you've got?"|
23881|"I won't let them kill you, even if you let me down."|
23882|Suddenly, with a surge of black magic, the Winged Duke appears next to the Second Prince and the Queen.|
23883|The Winged Duke casts a spell, absorbing the powers of both.|
23884|The Winged Duke evolves into an unholy beast like no other.|
23885|The Winged Duke seethes with god-like power as he leers down at everyone.|
23886|Odum appears stunned as he stumbles over to the Second Prince's body. |
23887|Odum doesn't respond. He simply stares down at the body.|
23888|Alex says he will stay and look after Odum. You should report back to the Grand Bishop.|
23889|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Ruth was defeated.|
23890|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Gainey was defeated.|
23891|Turbine Settlement Southwest Pond|
23892|Drone Patrol-X strikes! Insert the Virus Chip now!|
23893|You see many giants lumbering about up ahead.|
23894|There's something about them that's different from giants you've seen before.|
23895|Better tell Acey about this!|
23896|The Glyphed Shackles! How can it be?|
23897|Think a mere rune can defeat me? How naive...|
23898|Take Acey and find the Dimensional Fissure.|
23899|Defeat the Dimensional Giant King from the Dimensional Fissure!|
23900|Victoria appears along with soldiers from the Church.|
23901|Victoria seals the Dimensional Fissure using the scepter.|
23902|You bring Acey to where the corpse of the Karok Chief was found.|
23903|Let Acey inspect the location of the Dimensional Fissure.|
23904|Who knows what would have happened if Victoria hadn't sealed the Dimensional Fissure.|
23905|You're a bit curious as to what Puckett is doing here...|
23906|Alex asks you to dive into the fray and help Odum fight.|
23907|Odum and his team are battling a giant monster up ahead!|
23908|Alex: I'm coming to your aid!|
23909|Another Mushroom Titan has emerged from the ground and blocked the path!|
23910|Church Troops have established a provisional base at the entrance to Cadilla Felwood. There's a fierce battle being fought up ahead.|
23911|The incantation of a curse can be heard up ahead.|
23912|This raging fire is fueled by the magic of the Karok Soulmaster.|
23913|The Karok Soulmaster has died, and the raging fire has subsided.|
23914|An Ancient Demon Soldier has been resurrected from the pile of skeletons.|
23915|The ground is strewn with soldier and monster corpses. The soldiers must have already charged in...|
23916|Victoria, who was thought to be dead, suddenly appears in the corner.|
23917|There are only a few corpses here. It looks like the soldiers were able to take this area without meeting too much resistance.|
23918|You return to the Smuggler's Cabin via the Portal, and pass on the military intelligence report to Victoria.|
23919|You then join Victoria and Puckett in removing the seal from the entrance to Cadilla Felwood.|
23920|Under Puckett's lead, the three of you reach the borders of Cadilla Felwood.|
23921|You haven't yet removed the seal, so you can't head back to the ranch yet.|
23922|Puckett: I seem to recall a large fruit tree growing near the portal.|
23923|We've already been down this road. We should try another...|
23924|Puckett: Go take a look, then come back and tell me which road to take.|
23925|Puckett: Ah! It's a Frenzied Ogre! We shouldn't take this road...|
23926|The road is blocked by a barrier! We'll have to go back and find the correct route.|
23927|The group uses a Portal to travel to their destination.|
23928|A black mist barrier and a strange crystal appear before you, blocking the way.|
23929|Follow Puckett to find the switch to turn off the crystal.|
23930|Oh, no - that was the wrong switch! It's opened a secret portal and summoned a Frenzied Ogre!|
23931|Screech! The switch has come loose.|
23932|This looks like a switch. Try turning it on.|
23933|Turn on the switch! Maybe a miracle will happen...|
23934|A black mist barrier has blocked the road. It's impossible to get through.|
23935|We're on the right track. This no time to give up and head back!|
23936|The road is blocked by a black mist barrier, held in place by the crystal.|
23937|Follow the Soulless Snail to see where it goes.|
23938|This is the place. Defeat the Seal Sprout to remove the source of the magic interference.|
23939|You hear the calm, familiar voice of a commander. Tatiana must be nearby...|
23940|This place hides an abnormal, suppressed energy. The surrounding ghosts look like a troop of Warlocks.|
23941|Thank you. I'm finally free...|
23942|Find where the treasure is hidden.|
23943|The summoning ritual unsettles me. I can't let them cut off our escape route...|
23944|There's still some water in the kettle. Pour it out, then give the kettle to Maya.|
23945|The treasure's hiding place has been discovered! Hurry back and inform Clerk Mirabelle.|
23946|Find the pirates' treasure.|
23947|Wait for Puckett and Victoria. Don't be rash and go it alone!|
23948|This may just be a normal tablet. Let Puckett identify it.|
23949|After the entrance was unsealed, the group entered Cadilla Felwood.|
23950|How are we going to remove the seal?|
23951|The seal has made you feel very ill!|
23952|Ghost Assembly Point|
23953|There's a young man from Emerald Town up ahead. Go question him.|
23954|Victoria deals a powerful strike, stopping the Demon Glutton in its tracks and dealing a fatal blow.|
23955|Watch out!!!|
23956|There is a strong magic pulse ahead!|
23957|It looks like a fierce battle was fought here not long ago.|
23958|Click on the tree in front of you to see if it's the one that Puckett described.|
23959|Failed! Talk to Puckett for the next selection.|
23960|The Fragrant Monstrosity, Fish King of the Mushroom Forest, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
23961|The Lake Lurker, Fish King of Emerald Marsh, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
23964|The Karok Berserkers are heavily wounded. It will take some time for them to recover.|
23965|Lead the soldiers on an offensive while the Karok Berserkers are wounded.|
23966|Just when it looks like you're surrounded by the Karok Berserkers, someone throws a smoke bomb!|
23967|Chaos breaks out, giving the soliders the chance to flee.|
23968|The soldiers are raring to go. Join them and attack Turbine Settlement!|
23969|The soldiers have been frozen in place by the Karok Sorcerer's curse.|
23970|Para Ryan: Well, well... you've turned me into a mushroom! Once I've dealt with the Charm Queen, I'll turn you into one too, and set you out to dry in the middle of the Ventos Tribe.|
23971|It... it's still evolving. Did I underestimate the power of the Winged Duke?|
23972|The Winged Duke has gained the "Scarlet Arcane" power. Use the Scarlet Magic Circle to remove it.|
23973|The Winged Duke has gained the "Blue Arcane" power. Use the Blue Magic Circle to remove it.|
23974|The Winged Duke has gained the "Azure Arcane" power. Use the Azure Magic Circle to remove it.|
23975|The Winged Duke has gained the "Golden Arcane" power. Use the Golden Magic Circle to remove it.|
23976|This mushroom has a unique smell, which catches your attention.|
23977|You're covered with Spore powder. You've turned into a mushroom...|
23978|You've inhaled Spore powder. Your muscles start to transform. You've turned into a mushroom!|
23979|You've wounded a mushroom. The nearby mushroom spirits are angry, and they start to advance on you...|
23980|The Second Prince has turned into a mushroom, but he should be back to normal soon... hopefully.|
23981|You pick a mushroom, and a new mushroom pops up in its place.|
23982|It would be better to do something more meaningful...|
23983|... I think I'd better do something a bit more meaningful... like help Odum and Alex.|
23984|I'm not sure whether to continue with this mindless task...|
23985|Pick mushrooms? Great! That's just what I wanted to do.|
23986|To be honest, I want to punch myself...|
23987|Ah - take this!|
23988|Amidst the low chanting of curses, a huge skull emerges from the Magic Circle.|
23989|The Mutated Spider King has discovered you and Victoria. It's attacking!|
23990|The ground trembles, and the Demon Glutton emerges from the soil.|
23991|Use Puckett's directions to find the portal to Cadilla Felwood.|
23992|You've already closed the barrier. Follow the lights to the red arrow.|
23993|Victoria raises her sword and mutters something you don't understand.|
23994|Victoria works her magic. The seal disappears before your eyes!|
23995|The Demon Glutton utters a curse with his dying breath. The ground begins to tremble...|
23996|Capture the Fleeing Fledgling on the roof.|
23997|Powerful black magic prevents you from passing through this barrier. You'll have to find another solution.|
23998|Ugh... my head hurts... I hate this feeling.|
23999|As Victoria moves, burning meteors fall from the sky onto the seal.|
24000|At the root of Titan's Grove, all looks green and peaceful.|
24001|But you can sense, from the evil magic in the air, that this spot has been invaded and polluted.|
24002|The Tree Dryad, native to Titan's Grove, is the guardian of this area.|
24003|But he's been corrupted by the black magic of the Demon Apprentices, and joined the forces of evil.|
24004|A wave of darkness rolls in from up ahead. You see an altar at the end of the corridor.|
24005|The closer you draw to the altar, the more you can feel the pulsation of a dark energy. You're no stranger to this kind of energy...|
24006|The altar is producing three forms of dark energy. They gather in the vacant space next to it, then disperse. |
24007|"Huh! Evil souls really do refuse to die!"|
24008|"You self-proclaimed warriors of justice are always foiling our plans."|
24009|"Bombing the water cave's gate has destroyed the magical source in Ghostweep Cave. There are all sorts of obstructions..."|
24010|"But now I grow tired of your despicable little tricks..."|
24011|"So I've decided to deal with you once and for all!"|
24012|The Winged Duke springs into action. Suddenly, he becomes surrounded by a dark force, then disappears without a trace.|
24013|Two clumps of mushrooms in the center emit an unpleasant aroma.|
24014|Mushroom Titan: You've damaged the mushrooms... you evil... get out... of Titan's Grove!|
24015|The Mushroom Titan senses that his fellow mushrooms have been attacked. He emerges from the ground, trembling with anger!|
24016|Mushroom Titan: Danger... help... Grrraah!|
24017|The earth shakes again, and another Mushroom Titan emerges from the ground to join the battle.|
24018|"Haha! This is a real party!"|
24019|"Seeing as everyone's just bursting with energy, why don't you play with these children?"|
24020|"So violent! You don't know where to draw the line, do you?"|
24021|"Come, then.... allow me to teach you!"|
24022|"That's just my phantom! Hahaha!"|
24023|"No... how... this is not in the script..."|
24024|The Charm Queen finally falls under the force of your attack.|
24025|Her power disperses, shaking Titan's Root to its core.|
24026|Once the shaking subsides, the Charm Queen vanishes. In her place, a bed of red flowers covers the ground.|
24027|On both sides, objects that look like egg sacs start to pulsate, as if alive.|
24028|There are egg sacs and little spiders everywhere. I have a feeling...|
24029|A Careless Karok Gnome approaches to inspect the egg sacs.|
24030|Victoria casts a spell to open a portal.|
24031|The Demon Glutton collapses after suffering a fatal blow from Victoria.|
24032|Jerry breaks into spasms of laughter and then disappears.|
24033|This is just a normal stone.|
24034|Please defeat the Frenzied Ogres quickly!|
24035|Please activate the tablet switch next to Puckett.|
24036|The switch to turn off the crystal is next to Puckett.|
24037|Victoria looks tired, but she is as swift and sure-footed as ever.|
24038|After the Mushroom Titans have bitten the dust, a familiar female voice rings out across Titan's Root.|
24039|As soon as the Charm Queen stops talking, a swarm of Canyon Crawlers emerge from underground!|
24040|To catch up with Victoria and Puckett., you need to follow the lights to the Portal.|
24041|Break open the wine barrel to attract the Phantom Bunnyhops.|
24042|The Phantom Bunnyhops sense the wine! Here they come!|
24043|The sober Bunnyhop moves like a cheetah! You'll never catch it!|
24044|But once drunk, you might just have a chance.|
24045|You hear the sound of a far-off wolf!|
24046|Fenrir gulps down the puddle of Intoxicating Wine.|
24047|The Phantom Bunnyhops will go back into hiding once the wine is gone. |
24048|You'll need to feed Fenrir something to get him to stop drinking.|
24049|Suddenly, a Karok Sorcerer appears and casts a strange spell.|
24050|Oh, no! We've walked right into the Karok Berserkers' ambush!|
24051|A plume of smoke rises, interrupting the Karok Sorcerer's spell.|
24052|Acey stares at the detector in his hands, trying to determine the position of the Dimensional Fissure.|
24053|A powerful Energy is emanating from the Dimensional Fissure. You have to be careful!|
24054|While Acey puzzles over how to deal with the Dimensional Fissure, a wave of magic flows by.|
24055|Victoria mutters something under her breath and then commences work on the Dimensional Fissure.|
24056|There's a fork in the road up ahead. One path leads to the Portal left by the demon camp.|
24057|This looks like the wrong path.|
24058|It looks like the middle path is the one to take.|
24059|This looks like the tree that Puckett is looking for.|
24060|This is the wrong direction! You need to attack the Turbine Settlement with the soldiers!|
24061|The Charm Queen activates the Arcane Teleport Gate. A horde of minions appear to fight for her!|
24062|The Tree Guards have arrived. Defeat them to break through the Charm Queen's defenses. |
24063|The Charm Queen condenses perfume to spray on marked targets.|
24064|The Ancient Demon General has awoken the Skeletal Ghost. The Skeletal Ghost will curse those affected by the Ghostly Grudge.|
24065|A nest of Self-Destructing Spiders has hatched. Steer clear of the damage they can inflict!|
24066|A nest of Thrashing Spiders has hatched. Their attacks inflict a debuff that makes you receive more damage.|
24067|A nest of Infected Spiders has hatched. If you get too close, your stats will drop.|
24068|The Demon Glutton has sent Gluttony's Slaves. Killing the Slaves will restore the Demon Glutton's HP.|
24069|The Demon Glutton has whipped the remaining Gluttony's Slaves into a frenzy!|
24070|The Demon Glutton drinks the blood of fallen Gluttony's Slaves to recover HP.|
24071|Just as you start to despair that the Mushrooms will never sprout, a Yellow Mushroom pushes out of the soil.|
24072|Charm Queen: Come closer! I've been waiting for you for ages!|
24073|"That's just my mirage! Hahaha!"|
24074|"How dare you be so disobedient?"|
24075|"I have an important mission to complete, but you just keep getting in the way..."|
24076|"So, I'll just have to...well, you know!"|
24077|In the midst of the chaos, someone reaches out and saves you from the smoke.|
24078|The Mutated Spider King has awoken. He certainly looks hungry.|
24079|The ground shakes as the Demon Glutton emerges from the earth.|
24080|Thanks to everyone here, the Demon Glutton has finally been vanquished! The Portal is now open.|
24081|Water the cherry tree.|
24082|Use Fertilizer on the cherry three.|
24083|Follow Victoria to the next battlefield and decide on your next move. |
24084|The Phantom Bunnyhops will go back into hiding once the dream wine is gone.|
24085|Fenrir is too full to even move!|
24086|You've found Shawn! Use the Enhanced Glyphed Shackles on him to seal his power.|
24087|An enraged scream comes from the Burlap Sack. Shawn struggles fiercely in an attempt to impede your progress.|
24088|Shawn's antics won't stop you, though. You decide to hand him off for Brook to deal with.|
24089|The air starts to vibrate as the Secret Chest appears.|
24090|Shirayuki: "I thought it was someone else..."|
24091|Shirayuki appears in the falling snow.|
24092|Shirayuki: "The Secret Treasure is extremely valuable. Forgive me for not allowing you to take it."|
24093|Shirayuki: "Be careful."|
24094|The appearance of the Secret Treasure destabilizes the force field.|
24095|Kaiser Zeta: "Halt, thieves!"|
24096|Kaiser Zeta descends, enveloped in light.|
24097|Kaiser Zeta: "I won't let you lay your hands on the Secret Treasure!"|
24098|Kaiser Zeta: "Take this!"|
24099|A treasure chest appears in the wake of Ruth's defeat.|
24106|You'll pay your debt to the Second Prince with your life!|
24107|Maya: "Hee hee! Where are you heading in such a hurry?|
24108|Report to <Left-Wing Butterfly> Maya.|
24109|You've caught <Horned Slayer> Gullah. Retrieve the egg and give it to Guard Rocky!|

24116|You've caught <Bigfoot> Biggof. Retrieve the urn and give it to Guard Kess!|
24117|Tobin: Don't... don't just leave me here!"|
24118|Report to Tafay Chief Tobin.|
24119|Talk to the Cursed Frog. See what it has to say about the next step.|
24120|When the Cursed Frog has finished talking, it disappears into the weeds.|
24121|You bend down and kiss the frog.|
24122|The frog shines with dazzling light as it turns into a fair maiden.|
24123|The frog shines with dazzling light as it turns into a fair maiden.|
24126|According to the Orb Compass, the Orb Fragments should be nearby.|
24135|After a while, your head starts to feel heavy and you nod off to sleep.|
24147|You solemnly pray to the Goddess Statue, but nothing happens.|
24148|According to the inscription on the statue, if someone cleanses the Sacred Beast Statue and then prays, something will happen.|
24149|A voice rings out from the heavens: "Thank you for your assistance, but no blessings shall be bestowed upon the irreverent."|
24151|You have earned the Goddess Statue's blessings as a reward for your kind and selfless efforts.|

30065|Give the Infinity Grass to Valerie to complete the Quest!|

30068|Talk to James.|
30069|You successfully escorted the kids home.|
30070|Tyrone's grandchildren seem to be saying something . Go see what they're saying!|
30071|Talk to each of the three children.|
30072|The children ignored you and started to bicker with one another.|
30073|The children still ignore you and continue to bicker with one another.|
30074|Pandemonium Incarnation Bavolaz: You little brats, don't you know that this is my resting place?|

30077|Follow the patches of light. Find Tyrone's grandchildren and bring them back.|
30078|Listen to Tyrone tell you of his worries.|
30079|Talk to Tyrone to open an instance.|
30080|Bavolaz: Oh, you've brought help. Interesting...|
30081|Bavolaz: But no matter. You all can only leave here if you can face my challenges.|
30082|Protect the children! Flush out the enemies in the ruins and take the kids home.|
30083|Bavolaz: Hmm. It seems my lesser demons didn't give you any trouble. How about this one?|
30084|You must defeat Hivenan before you can get the children out of here.|
30085|(You holler at the kids, letting them know it's time to get out of here.)|
30086|Louis: Thank you! We're getting' out of here!|
30087|The path is still blocked by more of Bavolaz's demons. Deal with them as quickly as you can.|
30088|Louis: Thank you! We'd never get far without your help.|
30089|Escort the children back to Tyrone.|
30090|Quest complete! Report to Tyrone.|
30091|Destroy the monsters that Bavolaz summoned as quickly as you can.|
30092|Hmm. I'll spare you this time, but don't expect any leniency if you dare cross me again.|
30093|Sheldon needs your help in dealing with the Golden Flowertraps. Pick some dried mushrooms and use them to lure the Flowertraps away from Sheldon's gold.|
30094|Ask Sheldon what he's looking for.|
30095|Talk to Sheldon again and see if there is anything you can do to help.|
30096|You set out a Fragrant Mushroom as bait for a Golden Flowertrap.|
30097|You hear something huge nearby. Did the Flowertrap Lord take the bait?|
30098|There are more Grudge Robots blocking the way. Destroy them!|
30099|Keep following Billy and keep him safe.|
30100|Destroy the Grudge Robot blocking the path.|
30101|Aaaaagh... you got me...|
30102|You see all of these discarded robots here? I'm going to rebuild them...and lead them in an uprising against humanity!|
30103|Defeat the Green Overlord.|
30104|Talk to Billy and report your progress.|
30105|Proof that you've safely escorted Billy.|
30106|Little Purple Fuzzball: Ow! That hurts, you know! Hey! Quit it! That's it, I'm leaving!|
30107|You place the Fragrant Mushroom on the ground, hoping to draw the Golden Flowertrap's attention.|
30108|You hear dozens of footsteps approaching. It's a horde of Golden Flowertraps!|
30109|It seems all the Golden Flowertraps in the area want some of that Fragrant Mushroom.|
30110|They're so desperate for the mushroom, they've begun fighting one another.|
30111|The Golden Flowertrap melee has reached a fever pitch. It's probably best to keep your distance.|
30112|The Golden Flowertraps went nuts when they smelled the Fragrant Mushroom, and will destroy anything that might keep them from it.|
30113|Golden Flowertraps are dropping all over the place, and yet the brawl shows no signs of abating. It's not long before the last one drops.|
30114|Head to the entrance and see if you can convince the Demon Recruit to let you in.|
30115|Keep heading toward the altar.|
30116|Up ahead you see what looks like a cage. Without warning, Lola runs up to it.|
30117|Defeat the demon and rescue the sprite.|
30118|Radamog: Did you really think you'd rescue her that easily?|
30119|Radamog: You'll have to ask my pets if you can take her. I wouldn't get your hopes up, though - she IS their dinner, after all.|
30120|Destroy the barrier and continue moving toward the altar.|
30121|Demon Recruit: Attention! Intruders! Someone is trying to rescue the sprite!|
30122|I need to take care of my sister; she's hurt really badly!|
30123|Keep moving toward the altar so you can rescue the sprite.|
30124|I'm impressed that you made it this far. But this is where your little rescue mission ends.|
30125|Keep moving towards the altar so you can rescue the sprite.|
30126|Go with Lola to defeat the Abyssalisk!|
30127|Hmph. Not bad, human. You seem to have some skill after all.|
30128|But now you face a foe like no other. Bring it on!|
30129|Break through the barrier around the altar and confront Radamog!|
30130|Pitiful human! You'll never be able to stop my ritual!|
30131|You think you've won? Don't make me laugh! I shall return when I've recovered my strength!|
30132|After your battle with Radamog, you find that Lola has healed her sister. The two of them have approached the sprite.|
30133|Quest complete! Report to Lola.|
30134|Thank you for all of your help. I wish you all the best in your travels.|
30135|Keep following the patches of light until you reach the Old Tomb Light Orb.|
30136|Enemies are attacking constantly, trying to keep you from rescuing their offering.|
30137|Cenobite Wizard: Don't feel too bad. You'll make a fine snack for our Demon Flowertrap!|
30138|Trollclops: How dare someone try and interrupt my ceremony and steal my Infinity Grass!|
30139|You hear the unmistakeable sound of children fighting.|
30140|Ray: You're such a jerk, brother!|
30141|You might want to head over there and see what the argument is all about.|
30142|Step forward and challenge Bavolaz.|
30143|Get rid of the enemies blocking the path so the kids can continue on home.|
30144|You picked the mushroom, but couldn't think of a use for it, so you threw it away.|
30145|Sheldon: The Golden Flowertraps are sure to be back soon. Please stop them from eating my gold!|
30146|Keep picking Fragrant Mushrooms. You need them to bait the Golden Flowertraps.|
30147|Young Golden Flowertraps have stolen the bait! Defeat them so you can use the bait on the adult Flowertraps!|
30148|Get rid of the Young Golden Flowertraps as quickly as possible.|
30149|After you defeated the Flowertrap Lord, Sheldon and his assistant approached you.|
30150|Must... attack... humans!|
30151|Grudge Robot: Attack... now!|
30152|How dare you... even think... of taking... my robots!|
30153|You've picked enough Water Flowers. Give them to Meira so she can weave them into a Flower Crown.|
30154|Proof that you helped Meira.|
30155|Meira took the blessed Flower Crown from the sprite's hands.|
30156|Well done! You should report to Meira.|
30157|You should defeat the three big yellow ones.|
30158|30158|
30159|30159|
30160|30160|
30161|30161|
30162|30162|
30163|30163|
30164|30164|
30165|30165|
30166|I'm here!  You hear the Bright Red Flower asking for help.|
30167|Looks like the witch is heading towards the village - catch up with her quickly!|
30168|There's a Bandit Sentry ahead. Think of a way to start a fire to catch his attention.|
30169|Spotted by the Guard! Gotta beat a temporary retreat...|
30170|You set fire to the rations, causing thick smoke to billow out.|
30171|Successfully started a fire and caused chaos in the Enemy's Camp. Taken by surprise, the Bandit Sentry left his post.|
30172|Successfully started a fire and caused chaos in the Enemy's Camp. The bandits scurried around the fort looking for the cause.|
30173|Beat them! No need to fear frightened bandits!|
30174|Discovered rations. If special tinder is used, a fire can be started immediately. (If you don't have the special tinder, you can get it from Al at the entrance.)|
30175|Discovered rations. If special tinder is used, a fire can be started immediately.|
30176|There are Guards all over in front - try to burn the rations on both sides to lure them away.|
30177|There are Bandit Sentries all over - burn the rations at the four corners to lure them away.|
30178|The Fort is on fire!|
30179|You useless rabble! You hear the Boss roar furiously.|
30180|Don't anyone  even think of passing through!|
30181|Fire..fire...it's on fire!|
30182|Run away! There's a fire!|
30183|A specter appears before you...|
30184|The tinder set fire to the rations instantly.|
30185|It can't be! My-my fortune! My glory! Why you little...!|
30186|After Al's father disappeared, you found the hidden rations.|
30187|This place is going to collapse! Get over here, quickly!|
30188|Successfully started a fire. The Guard has left his post - take the opportunity to defeat him!|
30189|Successfully caused a fire in the hall. The Guard has left his post - take the opportunity to run through!|
30190|The Fire Wall blocking the exit collapsed instantly...  |
30191|Al's Father appeared in front of the throne in the hall...  |
30192|It's not a good idea to fight with the Bandits here - get away quickly!|
30193|Al's Father disappeared on the way to the exit...  |
30194|Enemies appeared everywhere!|
30195|You've been ambushed.|
30196|(You hear someone murmuring in your ear) The fire isn't big enough; it has to burn the rations in all four corners....|
30197|We're still too late...  |
30198|Use this moment to rush inside!|
30199|Continue onward after defeating the Guards.|
30200|There's no need to create any more chaos here.|
30201|You heard sounds coming from upstairs...  |
30202|There's a bandit cruising for war rations! Quickly, defeat him!|
30203|Try talking to Al's Father.|
30204|The commissioner is ahead; talk to him first.|
30205|The poisonous mist before you smells horrible.|
30206|These seem to be the missing villagers, but there's something suspicious about them...  |
30207|These villagers are monsters in disguise! Defeat them!|
30208|Save me... You hear the Red Flower asking for help.|
30209|A voice rings out from the Altar within: "Don't think of leaving here..."  |
30210|You have been turned into an animal by the Witch. Go hide somewhere safe and wait for the effect to fade.|
30211|You hear a weak voice: "Please help me..."|
30212|I'm sealed inside the Red Flower. Please break me out, I beg you....|
30213|You have no way of advancing without my help...|
30214|Who broke into our village? Crazy Mudlings appear, deep within the village.|
30215|Continue onward!|
30216|Horrifying... Be careful not to anger the Witch.  |
30217|Lilian started to chant the spells, and as she finished, Leia's Clones appeared one by one.|
30218|You fake! I'm going to expose you!|
30219|Cheryl suddenly vanished, and you find yourself surrounded by Mudlings.|
30220|Llewelyn looks a little bit strange... You should check to see if he's ok.  |
30221|It would seem that the villagers are caught in a dangerous predicament. You should hurry towards the center of the village.|
30222|First you must target and defeat the Mudlings!|
30223|A piece of paper with gold trim captures your attention.|
30224|The curse is now broken! The villagers have transformed back into their human selves!|
30225|That witch is moving very fast! Hurry up, don't lose her!|
30226|All of a sudden, the Bright Red Flower turns into a girl!|
30227|Lilian rushes into the depths of the Altar. Quickly, follow her!|
30228|It's a trap! The Mudlings are going to surround you!|
30229|Llewelyn's spirit appears at the Altar!|
30230|You feel that you will not be able to pass through this place. Talk to the priest and see what you must do.|
30231|You've been transformed into an animal! Before the magic wears off, find a safe place to hide.|
30232|It's not yet possible to pass through here.|
30233|Strange how easy it was to find the Charm Queen...  |
30234|You shiver uneasily and try to pick up a scent in the air.  |
30235|Alex: The enemy is before us! Finish them off!|
30236|As soon as the Charm Queen disappears, a group of soldiers appears.|
30237|There is a strong magic pulse ahead!|
30238|"Hehehe... you don't give up, do you?"|
30239|"You should come out and greet the guests!"|
30240|You make your way to the frontlines.|
30241|The Charm Queen is the opponent...  |
30242|I have to join the fight!|
30243|Go support your allies!|
30244|The Charm Queen vanishes with a smile...  |
30245|"I'll play with you again later... Hehe!"|
30246|A force prevents you from advancing.|
30247|"Looks like my babies want to play. Hehe!"|
30248|Work together to defeat the Queen and the blind bugs!|
30249|We're ready. Let's kick some butt!|
30250|When you're ready to attack, stand on the indicated area.|
30251|At last, we're here! Looks like the fight has been going on for awhile...|
30252|How's the battle going?|
30253|Okay. I'll forge ahead and provide support!|
30254|The Charm Queen falls to the ground, dead...  |
30255|"Haha - of course it's not that simple!"|
30256|The Charm Queen reappears!|
30257|The dead Charm Queen has attracted large numbers of blind bugs!|
30258|Everyone saw many images of the Charm Queen.|
30259|As this war drags on, our casualties mount...  |
30260|We must defeat the Charm Queen and end this war!|
30261|The images of the Queen disappear, and swarms of blind bugs pour from the ground!|
30262|The Charm Queen's body emits Miasma and continues burning...
|
30263|Attack!|
30264|You finally made it! Quickly - Alex and the others are fighting the Charm Queen!|
30265|Odum and Para are pursuing the Charm Queen. Finish off the blind bugs first!|
30266|You rush to meet the troops, who are preparing to attack.|
30267|This is where Alex and the others will fight the Charm Queen again!  |
30268|The Charm Queen seems to have something else in store.|
30269|Her retreat is quite unsettling.  |
30270|The Otter is no longer angry, pain has made it come to its senses.|
30271|The Otter calms down, and begins investigating its surroundings. |
30272|The confused soldier looks around. He appears to be trying to figure out what hurt him.|
30273|"Akh!" (The Otter lets out an angry cry.)|
30274|"Ouuuhh!" (The Otter lets out an unsettling moan.)|
30275|Reymon: "Use your Taming Methods to tame the Otter!"|
30276|The Otter is getting used to you.|
30277|You've tamed the Otter. Pierre is ready, as well, so now it's time to remove those landmines.|
30278|Use "Dig" at suspicious locations and Pierre will handle the rest!|
30279|Talk to Reymon to learn how to tame the Otter!|
30280|You've successfully tamed the Otter. Report back to Reymon.|
30281|Pierre: "Four down! Keep up the good work!"|
30282|Pierre: "That's five! Don't give up now!"|
30283|Pierre: "Great! You're at six now. Just one more to go!"|
30284|Countless landmines have been buried in Otter Marsh. Taming the Otter is the only way to avert the crisis!|
30285|With the Otter and Pierre's help, all of the landmines have been removed. The crisis is resolved!|
30286|Tame the Otter and use it to remove these landmines.|
30287|They need to be removed before there are any casualties.|
30288| It looks like we'll first have to dispose of all these Sandworms!|
30289|Pierre: "The first landmine is gone! Don't get cocky, now."|
30290|The Otter has just recovered from the anesthetic and is wandering around in a daze.|
30291|Pierre: "Thanks a million. All the landmines are gone!"|
30292|Oh, no! Some magical force has stopped me...|
30293|Feed the Otter some fodder and observe its behavior to complete the taming process.|
30294|The eldest Makar prince has been poisoned - his body still hasn't returned to normal.|
30295|Ill as he is, he has made the trip here for the rune on the tablet. He is consumed with grief over failing to protect his younger brother...|
30303|Find the tablet and use the Magic Memory Ball on it.|
30309|Defeat the horde of Werewolf guards!|
30310|The second wave of Werewolf guards is attacking!|
30312|The Werewolf King has appeared!|
30314|Mia's Eidolon deals a quick and deadly blow to the Werewolf King, interrupting the curse.|
30315|Although the Werewolf King is defeated, there's no joy in this victory.|
30316|The inscription has already been sent to the Winged Duke!|
30317|We're too late again...|
30319|It must be up ahead...|
30999|30999|
31001|Go deep into the mine and find Hell's Crack.|
31002|Click on the Light-Marked Spots.|
31003|Hell's Crack has been sealed by the Holy Light.|
31004|I still haven't given you the tool to seal Hell's Crack! Come back first!|
31005|Venture inside to check - there should be be quite a number of cracks.|
31006|Monsters have already come out of this crack. Defeat them first.|
31007|Shane followed after you, after making sure no more dangers lurked within the crack.|
31008|Surprise! The cyclops spotted you.|
31009|Looks like another crack has opened not too far from here.|
31010|A hoarse howl echoes from deep within.|
31011|Arkham: There's a rat who's really making a mess here!|
31012|Arkham: Brothers! Bring me the corpse of that rat!|
31013|Shane: We're done for! The cracks in the deep have burst wide open!|
31014|Shane: The next enemy won't be a pushover. Be careful.|
31015|The next one's just behind the bridge. Go!|
31016|Arkham: I smell a rat. Go and get it!|
31017|Arkham: Those in the rear, provide support! Quickly now!|
31018|Other Side of the Crack: Boss! There are too many of us - we're all jammed in here and can't get out!|
31019|Arkham: It's all your fault, you dirty rat! I'm gonna enjoy crushing you!|
31020|A bloodthirsty Giant emerges from the crack.|
31021|The bloodthirsty Giant clambers back into the crack.|
31022|Other Side of the Crack: You up front! Don't move back; I'm sandwiched in here!|
31023|Set the Lamp facing it. (Right-click to use the Lamp of Love, Courage, and Hope.)|
31024|Feels like there's another monster coming out! Be careful!|
31025|This should be the last of them.|
31026|During the battle, cracks begin to appear on the Demon King's Eye Necklace.|
31027|Check in with Isaias and keep him safe as he searches for the Treasure Map.|
31028|Something strange is happening to all of the Crystal Ore.|

31031|Confirm the commission with Daisy.|
31032|Go deep into the Mine and look for Basil's tracks.|
31033|The egg on the ground looks like it could hatch into a bug at any time.|
31034|When you approach the egg, it hatches into a larva.|
31035|Basil: Hey! I'm in the deepest part!|
31036|Basil: Look at all these eggs. I'm approaching them now...|
31037|Basil: They look like they're about to hatch, but I won't bump into them.|
31038|Looks like a colossal creature rounding the corner of the passage.|
31039|Basil: He... Help! Come and kill them!|
31040|An intense battle shakes up the cave, raining down a flurry of stones that hit the queen bug.|
31041|Approach the area with the eggs and defeat the monster there.|
31042|A sharp shriek from the queen echoes from deep within the cavern.|
31043|Basil ran to the entrance of the mine with Daisy.|
31044|Basil: Aaaaagh! Bugs! Don't come any closer!|
31045|A group of bugs appears from behind and gives chase.|
31046|Basil: Soon...we'll be at that exit before we know it!|
31047|Daisy: Wait, seems like there's still something ahead!|
31048|The queen suddenly appears near the exit.|
31049|Basil and Daisy: Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!|
31050|Defeat the queen bug to help Basil and Daisy escape.|
31051|Finally...is it really over?|
31052|We should call the association and have someone study the bug eggs.|
31053|Haven't you seen enough of those bugs?|
31054|Daisy: Basil! Are you alright?|
31055|Sickle Spiderlings sprung up everywhere, blocking Basil and Daisy's way.|
31056|Basil: Thanks! I'll keep going, then.|
31057|Reid: They started the fight! Can you help the Lightning Gang beat the Ham League?|
31058|Shiloh: Don't be smug, Reid. The Ham League is just getting started!|
31059|Shiloh: The Ham League will never give up!|
31060|Shiloh: You guys are toast! Hogan can take down ten of you all on his own!|
31061|You see raging flames ahead, not far from here. Check out the situation.|
31062|Myria noticed you behind her. She turned, speaking with a smile.|
31063|Myria: Oh! Are you here to help get rid of the mollusks?|
31064|Talk to Myria to check on the situation.|
31065|Exterminate all mollusks nesting in this area.|
31066|Myria walked in after checking that no mollusks are nearby.|
31067|Two incubators sit in the corner, trying to hatch the mollusks' eggs.|
31068|Miriya: Hatched or not, we have to burn them all.|
31069|Miriya: Lucky us! This nest has no mollusks.|
31070|Many molluskss appear in the passageway.|
31071|Miriya: Mollusks are coming into the passageway! D-drive them off!|
31072|Miriya: A big, fat mollusk is blocking the way. Help me!|
31073|Venture further in and find the next nest.|
31074|This group ofmollusks realized that they're no match for you. Looks like they're gong to try something else...?|
31075|They fused together, and fused again...|
31076|And again...|
31077|A gigantic mollusk has appeared! If you don't kill it, Miriya will be in danger.|
31078|Miriya: Leave it to me! Just wait a second!|
31079|An intense vibration emanated from deep inside the burnt nest.|
31080|Along the narrow passageway, an endless stream of newly-hatched larvae come crawling out.|
31081|Miriya: There must be queen mollusks hatching them! We have to stop them!|
31082|A furious queen mollusk crawled out from the sea of fire.|
31083|Miriya: Dear Gaia! This one is mega-disgusting! Quick, get rid of it!|
31084|Miriya, hiding on the side, stepped out trembling.|
31085|Unsettling noises can be heard from deep within the cavern.|
31086|Oscar: Mina! I know you're in there! Just give me the treasure!|
31087|Oscar: Mina! Stop wasting time! Give yourself up and come out!|

31092|Go with Edward and help him defeat the monster.|
31093|Edward: Please defeat the monsters here!|
31094|Edgar hurried up to the altar.|
31095|You feel a steady stream of magical energy flowing from your body.|
31096|Continue delving deeper into the Ruins.|
31097|The mound in the corner has a strange shape, almost like something is buried beneath it.|
31098|Edward: We're finally here! This place is...|
31099|Edward: What? This shouldn't be a monster's lair!|
31100|Edward: You have to get rid of them! We can't let them desecrate these ruins!|
31101|A furious Enchanted Crawler squirms out and attacks you!|
31102|Edward: How can I ever thank you? Now we can truly enjoy these marvelous ruins!|
31103|Edward: Look at this spectacular mural!|
31104|Edward: And look at this majestic door!|

31121|The Ferocious Eclipse Rabbits on guard discover you and cry out, alerting their companions.|
31122|Ferocious Eclipse Rabbit: There's an intruder! Everyone, catch them!|
31123|Not good! Look at all of them... I'd better find a place to hide first.|
31124|The road here has been blocked by rotten tree trunks, with no way to pass through.|
31125|A Moonlight Rabbit is waving at you. Maybe she can tell you what's going on.|
31126|Luna seems to have heard something, and signals you to be quiet.|
31127|Shhh... I can hear the footsteps of a Ferocious Eclipse Rabbit headed this way.|
31128|You see an Eclipse Rabbit heading towards you, but it doesn't seem to have noticed you.|
31129|It looked this way, but didn't seem to see you at all.|
31130|Those are Ferocious Eclipse Rabbit guards. Don't go near them, or you'll definitely be caught.|
31131|I'll cast a guide spell - you can find the Moonlight Rice Cake if you follow the patches of light.|
31132|I'll wait for you at the other end of the cavern. Let's meet after you're done collecting Rice Cakes.|
31133|You hear noises ahead - a group of Moonlight Rabbits fleeing in panic.|
31134|You see a fat Eclipse Rabbit about to flatten the Moonlight Rabbits.|
31135|Quickly, defeat the Fat Eclipse Rabbit!|
31136|Thank you! We'd be goners if you hadn't helped us.|
31137|But...who are you exactly?|
31138|You explain the whole story, slowly, like you're talking to a five-year old.|
31139|So, you're here to take back the Rice Cakes? That's great!|
31140|I heard the Fat Eclipse Rabbit stored some of the Moonlight Rice Cakes in the big urn at the forked road. Go and take a look.|
31141|You see that the Eclipse Rabbits ahead seem to be holding a grand celebration.|
31142|They seem completely immersed in their celebration, dancing as though entranced.|
31143|You realize that some of them are glowing with golden light! Looks like they've got the Rice Cakes.|
31144|Use the Moonlight Mallet to deal a fatal blow to the glowing Eclipse Rabbits.|
31145|Just as you heave a sigh of relief, you see Luna waving at you from the underbrush.|
31146|Quick, go and see what she wants.|
31147|Just as Luna is about to speak, an earsplitting noise rings out.|
31148|Eclipse Rabbit King: "I can smell the stench of these INTRUUUDERS. Quickly, capture them!"|
31149|Eclipse Rabbit King: "Come, capture them quickly!"|
31150|You see huge numbers of Eclipse Rabbits charging at you. Defeat them all!|
31151|Eclipse Rabbit King: "Looks like you're not complete scrubs. I'll take care of you myself!"|
31152|Defeat the Eclipse Rabbit King!|
31153|Following the fall of the Eclipse Rabbit King, peace returned to the cavern.|
31154|Quickly, give Luna the Rice Cakes you've collected.|
31155|Talk to Luna first, then continue moving forward.|
31156|What you did has startled the Eclipse Rabbits - they started to cry out.|
31157|Eclipse Rabbit: "There's an intruder! Quickly everyone, catch it!"|
31158|Whining sounds drift from round the corner. Go take a look.|
31159|The foreman's loud scream catch the attention of many Guards.|
31160|Keep going deep within to look for others being oppressed.|
31161|Stop the sinister Dwarf and his robots from trying to conquer the world!|
31162|Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Deploy all personnel!|
31163|There are still people waiting to be rescued. Go back and save them first!|
31164|You managed to save everyone - now head deeper and destroy the sinister Dwarf's giant robot!|
31165|Rohm and his Robots have been defeated. After you shut down the Factory, you prepare to leave...|
31166|At the exit are people preparing to leave, and women who are looking for villagers.|
31167|A woman runs inside hurriedly.|
31168|There seems to be something moving behind the pile of boxes.|
31169|There's a child hiding in the box!|
31170|Defeat the foreman and save the people from their suffering!|

31188|The Black Mist here is making folks feel uneasy. Let's head back and talk to White Beard first.|
31189|A strange-looking creature is calling to you. Go and see what it wants.|
31190|The Guardian Spirit Floret rushed to the side, leaving a string of Lights on the ground.|
31191|Please follow the lights, and move forward.|
31192|Floret: Here it is! This is the Spirit Torch! Come, quick!|
31193|You ignite the Spirit Torch.|
31194|The Spirit Torch blazes with a dazzling golden light that burns back the black mist.|
31195|Help Floret defeat it!|
31196|Daq: Hah! I'll make you as huge as I am. Then let's see if you're so quick to bite me!|
31197|Villagers who were transformed into monsters have returned to normal.|
31198|Floret has too.|
31199|Follow the lights Floret left on the ground, and keep onward.|
31200|Floret: This is the second Spirit Torch! Ignite it now!|
31201|Continue to follow the lights Floret left on the ground and move ahead.|
31202|Defeat Daq and his Dark Servants.|
31203|The Black Mist obscuring the Spirit Torch has now dissipated. Ignite it!|
31204|Under the dazzling golden light,  the black mist and the phantoms vanished.|
31205|Suddenly, Floret is transformed into a bug!|
31206|Daq: How could I just let you transform back to your original form? Heh heh.|
31207|Daq: Floret, you just keep on bugging me, so really, this form suits you best!|
31208|Daq's real self must be hidden on the Altar.|
31209|Follow Floret's instructions and defeat it!|
31210|Daq: Humph! You think you can change back to normal if you defeat me?|
31211|The dark mist gathers, coalescing into a being.|
31212|Daq launches a fierce attack!|
31213|You sense, almost instinctively, that a great threat lies ahead.|
31214|Heading back to White Beard to analyze the situation seems like a good idea.|
31215|The Village Chief and the villagers hurriedly rush over.|
31216|It seems like they've all changed back to their original forms.|
31217|Quickly, light it!|
31218|Be careful! Something seems to be lurking in the dark.|
32001|It might be threatening, but not really dangerous. Continue onward and find the treasure!|
32002|Security is quite tight here. I'll bet the treasure's not far!|
32003|Help Eddie out of his predicament!|
32004|You hear the faint sound of battle in the distance...|
32005|An evil aura emanating from the Crystal Ore stops you in your tracks.|
32006|Damn, the sneak-attack failed!|
32007|Surely you've heard of me, peeps - Eddie the Exorcist, demon destroyer extraordinaire!|
32008|Defeat the Crystal Shadow that has appeared.|
32009|Whoa-ho-ho! Did you see that? That's my TRUE STRENGTH, muchachos.|
32010|You're probably all excited to see me in action, I know, so let's go!|
32011|I can feel the Crystal Shadow's presence, like the lingering stench of a musty fart. Keep on your guard!|
32012|Yeah yeah. Piece of cake, yo.|
32013|Help Eddie eradicate the evil Crystal Shadow in the Mine.|
32014|I'm glad you've come. It saves me the trouble of hunting you down!|
32015|You humans are actually pretty good. Who knew?|
32016|If you have the guts to show your face, you ought to be prepared for death!|
32017|Where are you running?!|
32018|Don't just stand there slack-jawed! You came here to eradicate the Crystal Shadow, right?|
32019|I guess I'll have to take you on as my loyal sidekick. C'mon, sidekick!|
32020|......|
32021|Mwahaha... If we pop up in front of Callisto again, what do you think he'll say?|
32022|I'll let you in on a little secret. I haven't even been using my FULL POWER.|
32023|What a trifling attack! You're not nearly good enough!|
32024|Indeed, I don't normally talk this much. I'm just trying to soothe your nerves. I hope you appreciate the effort.|
32025|Hmmph! You think you can trap me like that?|
32026|Hee...|
32027|The evil aura before you hasn't dissipated. You can't easily pass through.|
32028|Let's go. This time, we'll bust up Callisto for sure!|
32029|Don't ask me where I got this staff. It's a MYSTIC SECRET.|
32030|Hah! Mere child's play.|
32031|If it was me, I'd definitely set an ambush on that bridge. Too bad they're too dumb to think of that, haha!|
32032|... Die!|
32033|Ah! My Dark Flare Crystal Ore...No!|
32034|See, I told you it was just a trap!|
32035|Mmm... After walking this long, my knees are...|
32036|Hmph, that despicable Callisto is still sending minions to try and wear me down.|
32037|Even if the staff's magical might has been exhausted, I'll fight to the very end!|
32038|Alright, it's your time to shine... Terminate Callisto at all costs!|
32039|Stand in for Eddie and eliminate Callisto, the Crystal Shadow Lord.|
32040|Exterminate Crystal Shadow Lord Callisto.|
32041|Callisto will send out powerful shockwaves to the surrounding crystals.|
32042|Watch carefully and dodge these shockwaves!|
32043|The Dragons in front keep attacking. Help the soldiers resist their attacks!|
32044|Kill the ferocious Triceragon on the front lines!|
32045|Searing flames are blocking the way forward.|
32046|The situation looks grim. Keep going as quickly as you can!|
32047|Get rid of the Bloodthirsty Triceragons!|
32048|Head up to the highlands and save the Captain!|
32049|Please! You must help the Captain!|
32050|There are Triceragons causing mayhem all over the place! We've lost several soldiers already.|
32051|We have to hold the line!|
32052|I'm sorry Captain, I tried my best...|
32053|A Bloodthirsty Triceragon noticed your presence and is charging straight toward you!|
32054|Eliminate the Violent Ticeragons.|
32055|Eliminate the Bloodthirsty Triceragons.|
32056|Head up to the highlands and save the Captain!|
32057|The Captain is safe, right?|
32058|The Captain would be proud! We've taken down a big one!|
32059|Why do the Triceragons keep attacking the village?|
32060|You need to get rid of the Bloodthirsty Triceragons before you can deal with the barricade up ahead.|
32061|The howling of dozens of Triceragons echoes all around.|
32062|When Arlo's HP drops below half, he will summon a Triceragon Egg and sacrifice it to regain health.|
32063|Destroy the Triceragon Egg before Arlo can absorb it, otherwise he'll recover a huge amount of HP!|
32064|You hear the patter of hurried footsteps all around.|
32065|Destroy the Triceragon Nest|
32066|Quick! You must get out of the Abandoned Mine right away!|
32067|Heeeey! You totally laid the smackdown on Callisto! With my solid-gold help, of course.|
32068|Captain... save him...|
32069|Oh, what's that...pungent smell? Get away from me!|
32070|Don't you dare bring that flower anywhere near me, you hear?|
32071|Go away!|
32072|Sneak by while the Wild Wolf is distracted by pollen.|
32073|Dad, don't leave Annie!|
32074|Lucy: "Keep pushing forward! I believe Robin is waiting for us."|
32075|The howling of wolves continues all around, sending shivers down your spine.|
32076|Defeat Sadlei and rescue Robin.|
32077|The clear sounds of flowing water seemed to call out, beckoning you closer.|
32078|Showering in the Spring of Hope fills you with vigor and energy.|
32079|Showering in the Spring of Eternity surrounds you with comfort and relaxation!|
32080|Lucy: "Mmm? There seem to be something moving behind us."|
32081|Lucy: "What!? Why is it you, Robin? How could this have happened?"|
32082|It seems Sadlei used black magic to transform Robin.|
32083|After Lucy administered aid, Robin stood up, almost as if a man reborn.|
32084|Looks like Sadlei's subordinates have been dealt with - move ahead with Lucy.|
32085|Hahahaha! How does it feel, striking down your beloved by your own hand?|
32086|After defeating Sadlei, you noticed he was carrying a potion. Could this be an antidote?|
32087|Lucy: "Careful, it's an ambush! Watch out for those two werewolves!"|
32088|Lucy: "Watch your surroundings! It's another ambush!"|
32089|Lucy: "Go on and take the Spring Water Bath."|
32090|Help Lucy defeat the Werewolves first.|
32091|Take out the Werewolf and Wolfdog first.|
32092|Lucy caught up - keep moving ahead with her.|
32093|Help Lucy deal with the Werewolf as fast as you can!|
32094|First, check with Sylvia about the current situation.|
32095|There seems to be some commotion up front - go hear what they have to say.|
32096|Defeat Hermano Ladron, then keep going forward.|
32097|Venture deeper and defeat Cult Leader Dabo to rescue Ganara.|
32098|First, borrow the Cultist ID from Sylvia by the entrance, and then talk to the Ticket Checker and enter.|
32099|Sinister Cult Bouncer: "You think you can get in without your Cultist ID? Get outta here!"|
32100|Ganara ran over, pursued by the cultists.|
32101|Cultist: "Once Hermano has finished his questioning, you can pass - not before!"|
32102|Defeat Hermano first, then continue onward.|
33001|Defeat the guards in front protecting the wild boars!|
33002|The wild boars have already been released. A Sprout is diverting them away.|
33003|The Sprout will take care of things here - keep on going.|
33004|The Grass Kingdom Elder is waiting for you in front.|
33005|The Grass Kingdom Elder sent Sprouts to sneak into the Village first.|
33006|Let's hit the road! The Princess is depending on you to rescue her!|
33007|After the wild boars left, you found Moe unconscious!|
33008|You find the unfortunate Rehia in a huge mound of poo to the side!|
33009|You hear the sound of battle up ahead. As you draw closer, you hear screams...|
33010|You heard numerous Trolls roaring up ahead.|
33011|The Trolls are furious about the runaway wild boars!|
33012|The Trolls have found you, and they're running toward you!|
33013|Rehia casts Furious Rage on the wild boars, making them bigger and stronger!|
33014|The King of Gluttony has appeared, turning the wild boars into slabs of ham with a single strike!|
33015|You defeated the King of Gluttony in time and rescued the Princess.|
33016|Some wild boars have not been released yet. Search for them in the village.|
33017|Awaiting you is the Grass Kingdom's Eternal Elder, Yeshe.|
33018|The Eternal Elder incants a powerful spell that will allow you to enter the nightmares of his people.|
33019|The gate to the dreamworld is open. Hurry and enter!|
33020|Yeshe has placed a powerful aura around you that will protect you from the effects of the nightmares.|
33021|The aura protecting you from the nightmares has dissipated...|
33022|You find yourself inside of Cole's nightmare.|
33023|Cole is trapped in a nightmare of the time she was attacked by a Troll and several Mudlings.|
33024|The Troll is calling out more and more Mudlings. Defeat it and rescue Cole!|
33025|You've freed Cole from her torturous nightmares. The surroundings begin to swirl as you're pulled into another nightmare...|
33026|You find yourself inside of Rehia's nightmare.|
33027|Rehia is dreaming of when his tryst with the Sealand Princess turned sour.|
33028|Help Rehia escape by stopping the Sealand soldiers pursuing him.|
33029|You've freed Rehia from his torturous nightmares. The surroundings begin to swirl as you're absorbed into someone else's nightmare...|
33030|You find yourself inside of Moe's nightmare.|
33031|Moe is surrounded by the insects he's most afraid of.|
33032|Help Moe overcome his fear by destroying the bugs!|
33033|You've freed Moe from his torturous nightmares. The surroundings begin to swirl as you're transported to someone else's nightmare...|
33034|Only Zinnia remains.|
33035|Something is wrong. You don't seem to be in the dream of anyone you recognize.|
33036|Ah! So you're the one messing with my dreamworld!|
33037|So, you want to save this Sprout? Hah! Keep on dreaming!|
33038|I'll show you just how powerful this nightmare is!|
33039|King of the Dream Eaters: No! How is this possible?|
33040|As the nightmare dissolves, you find yourself back in reality.|
33041|Zibo: Barlo! I'll never forget this!|
33042|Zibo: Next time, you're dead!|
34001|You sense an evil aura ahead. Act quickly and find out what happened!|
34002|The Demon Captain seems to have noticed you!|
34003|Defeat the Demon attacking you!|
34004|To find out what happened, ask Watson, an injured, former Knight of the Light.|
34005|Two residents of the wasteland stand before you.|
34006|Use Holy Power to find out if any demons have snuck in!|
34007|Continue ahead and mingle with the wasteland's residents.|
34008|There seems to be a family living not far from here. Pay them a visit.|
34009|A strange look covers the old woman's face, beads of perspiration gathered on her forehead.|
34010|The Holy Power in your body suddenly begins to surge!|
34011|You see a suspicious-looking villager.|
34012|Follow him to the patch of light and find out what happened.|
34013|Before you realize it, you've been surrounded!|
34014|We've kept you waiting for so long!|
34015|As long as I attend to this matter personally, we have nothing to fear from them!|
34016|Mayin is just ahead! Follow Watson and move toward the patch of light!|
34017|Mayin's demonic minions congeal from the shadows, one after the other.|
34018|Haha, do you feel the grave calling out to you, old man?|
34019|A deep and mysterious voice bellows from the gorge.|
34020|I'm afraid it's you, Mayin, who's on a one-way trip to hell!|
34021|A different voice, higher pitched, matches the first voice word-for-word.|
34022|A mysterious figure appears suddenly, suppressing all the demonic minions with ease.|
34023|Defeat Mayin together with Watson!|
34024|Mayin escaped from the battle with his minions.|
34025|Try talking to this family.|
34026|Just as you were surrounded, you heard Watson calling out.|
34027|Move forward with Holy Radiance, and talk to the residents of the wasteland.|
34028|Please talk to Ali and help him solve his problem.|
34029|Mama Armordillo's vigilance range has grown!|
34030|Follow Doctor Crow, and help him solve the park's problems.|
34031|Talk with Reggie and help him solve his problem.|
34032|Go to the nest and steal the armordillo's egg, carefully avoiding the Mama Armordillo.|
34033|Mama Armordillo appears to have realized that something's amiss.|
34034|Hand the egg to Tilde while still carefully avoiding the Mama Armordillo.|
34035|The Mama Armordillo has spotted you, and is enraged by your suspicious moves!|
34036|For safety's sake, it's better to retreat for now.|
34037|Kurska sniffs the ground, and finding the non-toxic plant.|
34038|Walk to the designated location and place the feed, waiting for the Thieving Rex to appear.|
34039|Continue on to the next site to place the feed.|
34040|You sense something moving around the corner of the cottage in the park district.|
34041|A huge pack of Thieving Rexes has appeared!|
34042|Capture them before they wolf down all the feed!|
34043|The feed's been eaten, and the Thieving Rexes have dispersed.|
34044|Move on to the next district and look for Doctor Crow.|
34045|Shut the Dizzy Thieving Rexes you've just captured into the cage!|
34046|Keep capturing the Dizzy Thieving Rexes before they finish all the feed.|
34047|Talk to Reggie and keep placing bait for the Dizzy Thieving Rexes to capture them.|
34048|Outdoor survival isn't as simple as it might seem.|
34049|The following course will explain everything you need to know in a handy presentation.|
34050|Follow Donna's instructions closely.|
34051|Guide the Ancient Panthera to pass the training exercise.|
34052|Knock down the nearby plants and drink their sweet sap.|
34053|Hunt nearby animals for food.|
34054|Pick medicinal herbs to salve your wounds.|
34055|As the herbs' effect kicks in, you fall into a deep sleep...|
34056|Be careful not to eat poisonous plants.|
34057|Try to defeat the weaker enemies first.|
34058|Speak with Donna and help her solve her problem.|
34059|Kurska tries to challenge the opponent standing before him.|
34060|Continue on to the next district and find Doctor Crow and Principal Hamon.|
34061|Let's take a little jaunt upstream on the river of time.|
34062|A hundred years ago? Hmm...too close.|
34063|Maybe a thousand years ago... No, I need to go further back.|
34064|Ten thousand years ago! Almost there, but I need just a liiiiittle more.|
34065|Here we are, 13,000 years ago... Back when the Giant Mountain Dragon ruled this land.|
34066|Hold off the Giant Mountain Dragon to buy Principal Hamon some time.|
34067|Your fierce offensive temporarily stunned the Giant Mountain Dragon!|
34068|Yeaaahh!|
34069|As Principal Hamon's roar thunders through the hills, several Iron Cages swooped down from the sky.|
34070|In the blink of an eye, the gigantic Iron Cage captured the Giant Mountain Dragon.|
34071|Hmm... Seems like it'd be best not to take too many of these Iron Armordillo Eggs at one time.|
34072|Well, right now might not be the best time to challenge this opponent.|
34073|This opponent looks like he's almost there.|
34074|Preparations are going well! We just need a little more time.|
34075|Preparations are almost complete! Just a bit longer...|
34076|Miner's Ghost: Who's that?! How dare you take my ring...|
34077|Escape Master: Obtained 10 Mirabelle's Blessings!|
34078|Miner's Ghost: Is that you? Give me the ring......|
34079|The ring may be hidden in the depths of the mine. Go see if you can find it!|
34080|This place is about to collapse... We'd better skedaddle before we become permanent occupants!|
34081|Cassidy: Ouch! That smarts!|
34082|Miner's Ghost: Who's that? You dare to take my ring...|
34083|Cassidy: No... no it wasn't me! I don't have it! Stay away from me!|
34084|Miner's Ghost: If I can't find the ring, you will never leave this place!  |
34085|Boy: See? He admitted that he's the Miner's Ghost!|
34086|Boy: I don't think he saw us. Is he just a phantom?|
34087|Boy: I was right!|
34088|Boy: It seems like he won't stop following us... It's a little bit creepy...|
34089|Boy: Hmm... you can defeat that ghost with just one attack, right?|
34090|Boy: I'm familiar with this place! I think we're almost there.|
34091|Stop it! You shout.|
34092|Please go to (785, 791) to charge the Guiding Device.|
34093|When the color of the aura beneath your feet turns the same color as the Barrier, press "Activate Magic Barrier".|
34094|The Magic Barrier has been completely dispelled.|
34095|4 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34096|3 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34097|2 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34098|1 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34099|"Rooooaaarr!"|
34100|The Guiding Device's energy reserves are completely charged. Go to the Magic Barrier Switch to remove the barrier.|
34101|The Guiding Device's energy reserves are completely exhausted. Please find the Energy Furnace Guiding Device to recharge it.|
34102|"We have to destroy their ritual! Charge!"|
34103|"Hahahaha!"|
34104|You have been trampled by wild boars, and are stunned.|
34105|Use your torch to thaw the Frostbitten Catseye Sailors.|
34106|You successfully saved a Frostbitten Catseye Sailor.|
34107|You were trampled by wild boars, and the Church Warlocks brought you back to the entrance.|
34108|You have found Frost Crystals!|
34109|You summoned a Mining Robot.|
34110|Nothing found. Try again at another spot.|
34111|Go to (120,560) and use the Portable Drill.|
34112|You have reached your destination - now eliminate the Ghostspinners!|
34113|You have gained "Lively Blessing" for 3 minutes.
Follow the Magic Circles to reach the Ghostspinners.|
34114|Charm Queen: Well well, looks like you decided to show up after all!|
34115|Charm Queen: Unfoooooortunately...|
34116|Charm Queen: You're always one step too late!|
34117|Charm Queen: Why don't you amuse yourself by playing with this?|
34118|Charm Queen: Alas, beset by rabble-rousers once again!|
34119|Charm Queen: Now I'm bored, and you know what that means.|
34120|Charm Queen: You can help me kill some time!|
34121|Charm Queen: Oh! I think I actually broke a sweat back there.|
34122|Charm Queen: I understand you're here to stop me from breaking the seal, no?|
34123|Charm Queen: Well then...catch me if you ca~an!|
34124|Charm Queen: How about...|
34125|Charm Queen: Soon, the seal will be broken.|
34126|Charm Queen: Heehee...|
34127|The winds from the cyclone lash up and down. You realize that the Sky-Dragon King's tremendous energy is beginning to dissipate.|
34128|The energy has dissipated... only the empty Earth Seal remains.|
34129|With a colossal roaring noise, the earth itself pitches and churns.|
34130|In the name of God, release the imprisoned Bisolen!|
34131|Bisolen: I shall harvest the souls of all beings...|
34132|Alex: Look out! Bisolen has been released - get ready to fight!|
34133|After an intense battle, Bisolen lies in a pool of blood. The deep voice begins speaking again...|

34151|The guardian of the ceremony has blocked your path!|
34152|A battle could break out at any moment. Move forward to support Odum and Para!|
34153|The Priest suddenly appears and creates a new barrier around the Energy Furnace Guiding Device!|
34154|After the priest dies, the magic barrier collapses.  |
34155|There's an energy fluctuation similar to that of the wisps in the Haunted Passage.|
34156|The fallen Warlocks' life force has been stored in those devices. Destroy them to interrupt the ritual!|
34157|The device has been damaged. Many of the Warlocks are unable to cast spells!|
34158|The device has been damaged. The flow of energy has been interrupted!|
34159|The device has been completely destroyed. You have successfully halted the ritual!|
34160|The Duke is shielded by a magic barrier, which blocks you from advancing.|
34161|Help Odum stop the ritual!|
34162|The Duke absorbs several of the sorcerers' souls, as the others try to escape.|
34163|Hurry onward and stop the ritual!|
34164|Catch up with Odum!|
34165|Take the Guiding Device and rendezvous with Odum!|
34166|If you and Odum work together, there's no way they'll complete that ritual.|
34167|The Second Prince has gone missing! How could we have let this happen?  |
34168|We must save the Second Prince!|
34169|Use the skill that matches the barrier switch color to remove the barrier.|
34170|The barrier has been disabled. The Warlock King and the Avian King are blocking the path to the ritual!|
34171|The Duke smiles and disappears at the entrance to Titan's Root.|
34172|The entrance to Titan's Root is suddenly charged with powerful magic!|
34173|Go forward and attempt to enter Titan's Root.|
34174|You've been bound by magic and drained of your power!|
34175|Press onward so that Odum and the Second Prince can stop the ritual!|
34176|Charging complete. Use tje magic barrier switch to remove the barrier.|
34177|Destroy the devices to interrupt the ritual!|
34178|Priests have appeared to thwart your efforts. Defeat them and destroy the devices! |
35001|The Abandoned Robot has blocked the entrace of the factory. Can you find a way to move it?|
35002|The destroyed Armor collapsed, then converged on you, encasing you in a powerful suit!|
35003|This advanced armor can perform feats of incredible strength. Use it to get rid of Abandoned Robots blocking your way!|
35004|You heard strange flapping sounds, but didn't see anything unusual.|
35005|Geshara the Nightmare Maverick's shadow power is well-suited for assassination and covering your tracks!|
35006|Vladimir the Ferrous Maverick's fiery power can scorch any target!|
35007|Montague the Gale Maverick's ice power can freeze everything in the area!|
35008|Talwagen: Target identified. Prototype machine armor Rockman. Status: AAA-class threat.|
35009|Talwagen: Hostile status confirmed. Maximum alert! Destruction Mode engaged!|
35010|After defeating Talwagen, the armor suddenly detached from your body.|
35011|Dr. Wright: Thank you. You fulfilled Rockman's mission and stopped the Iron Maverick Army.|
35012|A special target appears on the Armor's Radar - it seems that an engine that emanates a special energy is nearby.|
35013|Red Alert! Area C has been invaded! Maverick Overlord program has been activated!|
35014|Blue Alert! Area A has been invaded!|
35015|Yellow Alert! Area B has been compromised!|
35016|Dr. Wright: It's painful to see all these robots, twisted by hatred and bent on destruction.|
35017|Dr. Wright: You know, these Robots were originally produced to make the world a better place.|
35018|Dr. Wright: Dr Willie and I once worked together, studying artificial intelligence. Our hope was that robots could improve the quality of peoples' lives.|
35019|Dr. Wright: After one went out of control, everything spiraled downward. These robots now call themselves 'Mavericks' and care only for killing...|
35020|Dr. Wright: Please use Rockman's strength to stop these Robots. Perhaps in doing so, you'll understand why we originally made them.|

35053|On Silverash Shore, you can catch cod to make Fish 'n' Chips.|
35054|After equipping a fishing rod and bait, catch cod to make Fish 'n' Chips and then give it to Club Cook Jose!|
35055|Fishing items can be purchased from an Anglers Anonymous Merchant (590, 176).|
35056|Please ask the Assistant Referee nearby about getting a Club Membership Card.|
35057|Oh no - the beer has been left out too long! Please abandon this quest and try again.|
35058|Wow! That's correct! You are the master of the World Cup!|
35059|Defeat Alpine Snails to obtain Superior Snail Meat. It's the best kind for barbecuing!|
35060|Sorry, that's incorrect. Please think it over and try again.|
35061|Deliver beer within 60 seconds.|
35062|Answer the question correctly|
36001|Nelly: Soon your mouth will be muuuch wider! Hehehe! Don't worry, it won't hurt at all...|
36002|Simpson: Ah! Finally, someone saw the request. Quickly, quickly, come over here!|
36003|You drink the transformation as Simpson instructed. Suddenly you turn into a flying pumpkin!|
36004|Simpson: Dash it all! Something's after us! Quick, we must hide. We mustn't let her find us!|
36005|Nelly: Huh? Oh, is this the new small-type pumpkin? Maybe I was wrong! Hehe! I must have been a bit overexcited.|
36006|You will be released when the transformation spell wears off. Before this happens, try to touch the Light Orb to get Mirabelle's Blessing.|
36007|The pumpkin potion has worn off! Now that you're back to normal, the pumpkin monsters around you go dead silent.|
36008|Nelly: Run, everyone! Don't let them catch you! I'll try to save you all!|
36009|Nelly: Hmph! You annoying humans! I will not let you lay a finger on even one of these small pumpkins!!|
36010|Nelly found us! We need to retreat if we want to make another attempt at sneaking into the Haunted House.|
36011|We've lost Nelly, she was just too far away... We better head back to Simpson now to discuss what's next.|
36012|Nelly: Grr! Why can't I defeat you! This is soooo annoying!|
36013|Nelly: Aah! Look behind you! What is that!??|
36014|Nelly is about to turn around! Hide yourself now by using the hiding skill. (Hotkey: 1)|
36015|Looks like Nelly is heading towards the village - hurry and catch up with her!|
36016|Nelly: Aha! It looks like we have a new little pumpkin arriving! Come on now, stop playing hide and seek! Come here!|
36017|Nelly suddenly got mad and started to run. Now's not the time to hide - quickly, follow her!|
36018|Nelly runs into the depths of the Ghost House. Hurry up!|
36019|Nelly vanished without a trace! You had better tell Simpson what happened.|
36020|Simpson: You have to be very careful when you follow Nelly. You can't be too close nor too far away.|
36021|Simpson: If he looks like he's about to turn his head, use the hide skill to avoid detection. If you get caught, then hurry on back to me.|
36022|Tracking failed... hurry back to the hiding spot and wait for another chance.|
36023|Nelly: Pumpkin Power Activate! Hehe! Now you will never defeat me!|
36024|Nelly: Oh no... I've turned into Merrilee... I guess I'm much better looking!|
36025|Nelly: Aaaaaaand...shazam! With this much power, I'm not going down today!|
36026|Nelly: Hmph! I can't see out of this silly helmet! No, this just won't do...|
36027|Nelly: Abra-kadabra! Look at me.... Uh, wait, where is this wind coming from?!|
36028|Nelly: You...you didn't see anything, right? Who would wear such a flimsy skirt!|
36029|Nelly: Trans..form! Now you can't see me anymore!|
36030|Nelly: What is this... Powder? My nose feels terrible... Achoo!|
36031|Nelly: More than meets the eye - Transform! Hehe! Aren't I beautiful?|
36032|Nelly: Wa...wait a minute, I'm always the cutest. Don't you forget that!|
36033|Nelly: With your powers combined, I aaam.. Aaaargh?!.... Aaaargh...|
36034|Nelly:I.... I don't even wanna bother anymore. Just finish me off!|
36035|Transformation Potion time remaining: 40 seconds. Please be careful.|
36036|Transformation Potion time remaining: 20 seconds. Work harder!|
36037|Transformation Potion time remaining: 10 seconds. Hang in there!|
36038|Saint Nicolas: Excellent! I'll start repairing the sled straightaway! Just wait a bit while I go to work.|
36039|As Saint Nicolas was repairing the sleigh, the sky grew darker. The residents of the Small Winter Village went back home from the event too.|
36040|Saint Nicolas: The sleigh has been repaired, my young friend. Let's get this show on the road!|
36041|Jump onto the sleigh and then talk to Saint Nicolas to trigger the event.|
36042|The sleigh lurches forward with an unexpected heave! Aim carefully at the target and use the "Deliver Gift" skill to complete the mission.|
36043|The gift accidentally fell out of the sleigh. Please go back to the entrance and find Saint Nicolas to start over again.|
36044|Saint Nicolas rides the sleigh and takes you back to the entrance.|
36045|Saint Nicolas: Just wait a bit.  We'll get going soon enough.|
36046|The battle isn't over! Please keep fighting after your teammates have left the fray.|

37001|Sonia is following you. You must bring her to the main hall of the castle to offer her tributes to the Bandit Leader.|
37002|As soon as Sonia sees the Bandit Leader, she braces herself and bravely approaches.|
37003|That's all? Don't you think it's a bit pathetic?|
37004|The adjutant turns around and commands Sonia to follow him into the underground vault.|
37005|Opening a heavy vault door, the adjutant walks you both deep inside the castle into an area chock full of treasures.|
37006|Along the way, Sonia tried to gather information about Redd from the adjutant.|
37007|Come along! We'll be there after we climb these stairs.|
37008|My husband stopped by to offer tribute a few days ago but has not yet returned. Perhaps you remember seeing him?|
37009|Lady, so many people come and go here each and every day. How would I even know which one was your husband?|
37010|He would have been carrying two large boxes. I haven't heard from him since...|
37011|Listen. I told you, I don't know. Maybe he left you to get away from all the nagging!|
37012|Alright, find a spot and set down your tribute!|
37013|Is... Is that Redd?|
37014|Sonia notices a few people locked up near the corner of the room. One of them looks like Redd!|
37015|You... You awful people! I thought we had an agreement that if we offered tribute you would leave us in peace!|
37016|Break the fence so Redd and the other villages can escape.|
37017|Let's go! I'll get you to safety.|
37018|Hurry, try to get out of the castle!|
37019|Quickly! Run before the bandits find you!|
37020|You lead the villagers out of the underground vault, following the path you followed upon entering.|
37021|Thank you for getting us out of there.|
37022|Defeat the troops guarding the hall so that the villagers can escape.|
37023|After clearing the troops, the villagers continue rushing towards the exit.|
37024|That was awesome! If you didn't show up, we'd still be stuck back there for who knows how long.|
37025|Suddenly everyone hears the sounds of footsteps and laughter.|
37026|Oh, my dear little country bumpkins, you know you'll never escape!|
37027|The exit is dead ahead! Everybody, run!|
37028|Waiting for you at the entrance of the castle, the bandit leader and his troops prepare to recapture all the villagers all at once.|
37029|Sonia is following you. You must bring her to the main hall of the castle, and give the Tributes to the Bandit Leader|
37030|Be silent and follow me.|
37031|If you keep on speaking nonsense I will shut your mouth for good!|
37032|Chateau Valentine (Dungeon)|
37033|Chateau Valentine - Main Castle Hall|
37034|Adonis and his troops join in the chase, trapping the villagers in the corner.|
37035|Sonia: There are so many tough looking bandits in front, I'm so scared!|
37036|Enter Chateau Valentine with Sonia to find the missing Redd.|
37037|You ask the villagers to stay where they are while you eliminate the bandits in the lobby.|
37038|Leader Adonis found out that the villagers are escaping! He immediately sends his troops out to recapture them.|
37039|The villagers, surrounded, see that the Guard Captain at the front door is defeated and start to run towards the exit.|
37040|Sonia: Look out, behind you! The bandit leader and his troops are gaining on us!|
37041|Fend off the bandits blocking the exit so that the villagers can find their way out.|
37042|Zinnia is waiting; go report to her.|
37043|Accompany the people of the Grass Kingdom into the mountains and find the old woman!|
37044|Wild Boars are attacking the Princess up ahead!|
37045|After a hard battle, the Wild Boars have been defeated.|
37046|Zinnia grows quiet, as if in thought.|
37047|Continue into the mountains.|
37048|A little girl appears at your door. Perhaps something's wrong...|
37049|Ask the little girl what happened.|
37050|Go with everyone to find the girl's Grandma.|
37051|There are many Wild Boars in the area, blocking your path.|
37052|There are too many Wild Boars - finishing them off would take too long.|
37053|Don't touch the Wild Boars, or they'll get angry!|
37054|You made the Wild Boars angry! Quick, find a hiding place!|
37055|You've caught up with the Grasslanders, who still haven't found Grandma.|
37056|Suddenly, a Wild Boar charges!|
37057|Help defeat the Wild Boar King!|
37058|At last the Wild Boar King was defeated, and the old woman came out of hiding.|
37059|Help defeat the Wild Boars.|
37060|Go around them and up the hill.|
37061|You woke the sleeping boar! It starts attacking!|
40001|#824$#Are you starting to dislike me?|
40002|#824$#Am I... am I too weak to be your partner?|
40003|#824$#If you don't need me, please don't summon me.|
40004|#824$#Come on, don't ignore me...|
40005|#824$#Did I disappoint you? If so, I will try to do better.|
40006|#824$#You seem a bit distant lately. Is something wrong?|
40007|#824$#Hey, I haven't seen you in a while! What've you been up to?|
40008|#824$#It just doesn't seem like I matter to you at all.|
40009|#824$#If you're upset with me, just say so.|
40010|#824$#Am I not a valuable companion to you?|
40011|#821$#So good to see you again. Let's chat, shall we?|
40012|#821$#'sup? Anything I can help you with?|
40013|#822$#What do you do when you're not out adventuring?|
40014|#821$#If you're having trouble getting through a dungeon, try bringing a few friends along!|
40015|#821$#When we have some time, we should sit down and share our thoughts.|
40016|#821$#I hate weird stuff most. Isn't it great to have an ordinary life?|
40017|#822$#I always see you alone. Wouldn't it be more interesting to go out and make some friends?|
40018|#821$#Gotta spend some time getting familiar with the village.|
40019|#822$#If you want to change your weapons, you should visit a weapon merchant. You might score some Blue-quality equipment!|
40020|#821$#I really admire those who know how to use Dual Pistols! They're a powerful weapon combination that can be used to disrupt and attack at the same time!|
40021|#821$#You chose me from among many Eidolons. That means we have a special connection, right?|
40022|#822$#The rate that you're growing at is surprising everyone.|
40023|#821$#Don't worry about my feelings. Just do what you want to do.|
40024|#821$#Now that I've seen your skills in action, I have no doubt that you're the person I want to follow.|
40025|#822$#It doesn't matter whether it's humans or Eidolons. Just trust your partner and communicate!|
40026|#822$#Just make your attack. I'll be by your side, supporting you.|
40027|#821$#Your safety is more important to me than my own life.|
40028|#822$#Whatever you ask of me, I'll definitely try my best!|
40029|#821$#I'm willing to take on any enemy with you!|
40030|#822$#I admire your good judgement!|
40031|#824$#Are you upset with me? Is that why you're so cold?|
40032|#824$#I've always felt that you think of me as a brother. I never suspected that you didn't trust me at all.|
40033|#824$#You find me annoying, don't you? Have I seen through you?|
40034|#824$#If you don't need my help, just summon some other Eidolon!|
40035|#824$#It's so hard to be straightforward with you!|
40036|#824$#You still don't seem to trust me at all...|
40037|#824$#Hemming and hawing really irritates me!|
40038|#824$#Looks like you've completely underestimated my strength...|
40039|#824$#Learn from my attacks. Your weak strikes won't do anything!|
40040|#824$#If there's anything that you're unhappy about, just say it. I welcome any kind of criticism!|
40041|#823$# Ha! Perfect timing! I was bored to death!|
40042|#821$#Hah! As long as we're together, we'll be invincible.|
40043|#821$#You look happy. Did something good happen?|
40044|#821$#Our recent opponents have been so boring... Could we find a real challenge?|
40045|#822$#Just tell me what your problem is! I will definitely help you solve it!|
40046|#821$#One day you'll definitely be as strong as I am!|
40047|#822$#Fighting is such a joy when the enemy provides a challenge!|
40048|#821$#You look pretty fresh! You must have slept pretty well yesterday!|
40049|#822$#Challenging powerful enemies every once and a while would add some spice to our daily routine.|
40050|#821$#If you want to take a vacation, please remember to tell me.|
40051|#821$#I want to find out who's stronger: you or me.|
40052|#822$#Are you envious of my perfect body? Keep working, and you can have one just like it!|
40053|#821$#I see a great strength in your eyes.|
40054|#822$#It's quite interesting to wander around with you. You have all the best enemies, haha!|
40055|#821$#Just tell me when you have any problems. I'll help you, no matter how difficult it is.|
40056|#822$#The Envoy's Path must be chosen carefully, because it will directly influence your effectiveness in combat.|
40057|#821$#If you want to pursue the ultimate defense, then fortify your armor!|
40058|#822$#You look rather happy today. Did something nice happen?|
40059|#821$#One day I will be the strongest Eidolon in the world!|
40060|#822$#You've beaten so many powerful enemies. Looks like I've underestimated you.|
40061|#824$#Look me in the eyes when you speak to me. That is basic respect.|
40062|#824$#Can I get some time to myself? I don't want to see you right now.|
40063|#824$#Try to use your brain. I know you aren't this stupid.|
40064|#824$#Think, then act. Always remember that.|
40065|#824$#Attacking carelessly will only get you killed. Please, think before acting.|
40066|#824$#No matter how refined I seem, I still have emotions.|
40067|#824$#Am I not performing up to your standards? Is that why you're so cold towards me?|
40068|#824$#Did I disappoint you? I can do better!|
40069|#824$#If there's anything that I haven't done well, please tell me a better way to do it.|
40070|#824$#Don't get complacent! A person who challenges himself constantly will grow stronger!|
40071|#822$#So good to see you! Let's chat over drinks.|
40072|#821$#You should spend more time reading. Knowledge is power, after all.|
40073|#823$#Knowledge is nothing without the imagination to use it. Don't forget that.|
40074|#823$#Looks like you haven't been outdoors in a while! Would you like to take a walk with me later?|
40075|#821$#As long as you judge your enemy with your heart, you will be able to see their flaws.|
40076|#823$#Is there anything I can do for you?|
40077|#823$#What's wrong? You seem to be a bit irritated. If you want, I'm a good listener...|
40078|#822$#It's not healthy to stay up late all the time. Please, try to go to bed earlier.|
40079|#822$#Are you having trouble? Let's sit down and talk about it.|
40080|#822$#Your leadership is the reason our battle went so well.|
40081|#821$#Make sure you maintain your equipment! If you don't take care of it, it will betray you.|
40082|#822$#You should have Secret Stones with you. Their skill-increasing ability is very helpful.|
40083|#821$#Life is unpredictable. You never know what'll happen. That's why I cherish all the moments that I have with you.|
40084|#821$#Looks like you're in a good mood today. Any interest in reading with me?|
40085|#821$#I've been practicing my mind-reading again lately. I think your mind is filled with thoughts of treasure, right?|
40086|#823$#I've been waiting forever and a day! I've got so much to tell you.|
40087|#821$#I don't like fighting, but I'll do my best to keep you safe.|
40088|#823$#With your skills, I have no doubt that you'll be a true hero one day.|
40089|#823$#Reading is a wonderful pastime. You learn so much doing it!|
40090|#822$#If things are getting too tough for you to beat, why don't you try fortifying your weapon?|
40091|#824$#You're so weak and thin! You should eat better!|
40092|#824$#Sometimes I feel really bored when I'm with you.|
40093|#824$#If I hadn't agreed to your request, I might have been happier...|
40094|#822$#Don't blame me for not respecting you. It isn't like you've shown me any respect.|
40095|#824$#I'm not interested in talking to you right now.|
40096|#824$#Don't worry about me. I'm the best at running away!|
40097|#824$#Tell me frankly: do you like me?|
40098|#824$#What has become of the adventurous life that we wanted? Why have things been so boring lately?|
40099|#824$#I've always wanted to know: do you consider me a brother?|
40100|#824$#Some of the things that come out of your mouth are really pointless.|
40101|#821$#How about you change your outfit up? I'm so tired of seeing you in the same clothes everyday!|
40102|#822$#Remember to hang out with me! I'll find something fun for us to do.|
40103|#821$#It's so interesting to travel with you. I get to see lots of new things all the time!|
40104|#822$#How nice it would be if my partner were a pretty girl with beautiful long hair!|
40105|#821$#Have you gained weight lately? You should cut down on the sweets.|
40106|#822$#Sigh! Why aren't there any enemies worth my time?|
40107|#821$#Your skills seem to be improving. A simple punch from you is enough to deal with most enemies.|
40108|#822$#When you have any problems, let me know. I can't guarantee that I'll be able to help you, but I'll do my best.|
40109|#821$#I'm rather careless, so I guess I'm lucky to have you with me!|
40110|#822$#Do you know that you snore when you're sleeping? I can't really sleep well with all that noise!|
40111|#823$#Let's check out the dungeon later. I have a feeling that we'll find some rare treasure!|
40112|#822$#Don't get cocky after gaining a Lv.1 Secret Stone. You can still get it upgraded further by merchants in different cities and villages, making it even more powerful!|
40113|#821$#You have to keep improving! If I fall in battle, I need to be able to trust you to protect me as I've protected you!|
40114|#822$#Don't wait for the enemy to attack you! The best defense is a good offense.|
40115|#823$#Wherever you go, I'll definitely follow you 'till the end!|
40116|#822$#Don't you need to upgrade your equipment? It'll be really embarrassing if you fall before I do.|
40117|#821$#You might be scrawny, but you're pretty tough!|
40118|#822$#You look like you haven't been in love before... Would you like some tips?|
40119|#823$#Are there any dungeons with interesting events? If so, take me there!|
40120|#823$#You know, hanging out with you so much has taught me that you're really funny!|
40121|#824$#You don't want me to follow you, do you?|
40122|#824$#Hopefully we can learn to understand each other.|
40123|#824$#You've changed. You're not the same person that I once knew.|
40124|#824$#So this is the limit of your sincerity. I've overestimated you.|
40125|#824$#I'm not in a good mood now... Could you just leave me alone?|
40126|#824$#I'm a bit tired... Can we stop and take a break?|
40127|#824$#Am I not good enough for you to look in the eye?|
40128|#824$#Is my strength useless to you?|
40129|#824$#Your life would be better without me, wouldn't it?|
40130|#824$#My patience has a limit...|
40131|#821$#I'm so lucky to have gotten to adventure with you.|
40132|#822$#Good to see you again! Let's chat!|
40133|#823$#I'm so happy to be with you! We should chat more often.|
40134|#821$#You're pretty good! You'll have to tell me your combat secrets when you have a chance.|
40135|#822$#It's important to me that you're happy. Don't get too hung up on the opinions of others.|
40136|#821$#Don't let all these problems get you down. I'll always be by your side.|
40137|#823$#I'm touched whenever I see you working hard.|
40138|#821$#If you have something to tell me, tell me directly.|
40139|#822$#Did you make some new friends recently? If so, you must introduce me.|
40140|#821$#If there's something that you are too embarrassed to to talk to me about, remember that you have other friends too!|
40141|#821$#Undertaking quests is the best way to obtain EXP! Don't forget it!|
40142|#822$#If there's anything you need, you can go to Navea and shop around!|
40143|#823$#Do you need to change your equipment? You should try to hunt down some gear in the local towns and shops. They have some real treasures sometimes!|
40144|#823$#Your safety is the most important thing to me.|
40145|#821$#Whatever your decision, I'll stand by you 'till the end.|
40146|#823$#Even if the whole world turns its back on you, I'll still be here to support you.|
40147|#821$#You can get tokens by completing certain quests. These tokens can be exchanged for some unusual items!|
40148|#822$#Skill Points can be reset, but it takes quite a lot of money to do! So, remember to be careful with your points!|
40149|#823$#If there's anything I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask. I love to help out!|
40150|#822$#Do you feel more confident with me around?|
40151|#824$#You know you've been acting pretty cold towards me lately, right?|
40152|#824$#Out of all the things in all the worlds, I think I hate you most.|
40153|#824$#You seem pretty unhappy with me.|
40154|#824$#I've got nothing else to say to you!|
40155|#824$#I want to scream to vent my frustrations!|
40156|#824$#I thought you had bigger dreams. I never imagined that you'd be content with something like this.|
40157|#824$#Even though you're my partner, you should still be polite!|
40158|#824$#Can you please stop being so childish?|
40159|#824$#I've had enough of your slow attacks! You're going to get us both killed!|
40160|#824$#You're so narrow-minded... Can't you learn from my courageous example?|
40161|#822$#Haha! So you're bored again and want to find someone to chat with?|
40162|#821$#Excellent speed allows you to evade danger, as well as giving you a better chance to attack.|
40163|#822$#You can train with me when you're not busy. I'm sure it'll help you a lot.|
40164|#821$#You'll be more powerful if your attacks were more direct. I'll teach you some techniques later.|
40165|#822$#You need to be alert in dungeons! Wouldn't it be humiliating if you set off a trap by mistake?|
40166|#821$#When I see you being so sensitive, I worry I'm being too bold.|
40167|#822$#The more time I spend with you, the more I see that you are a reliable partner.|
40168|#821$#You're advancing quickly! I knew I was right about you!|
40169|#822$#Don't forget to bring me along to a dungeon! Every extra hand helps!|
40170|#821$#Just let me know if you want to hear my thoughts.|
40171|#821$#Numbers give strength. Try to group up with friends more often.|
40172|#822$#I swear I'll protect you, even if it means sacrificing my life!|
40173|#821$#You're really important to me... Without you, who would I train with?|
40174|#822$#You're really skilled! This must be because of all of the trials you've been through, right?|
40175|#821$#I never realized that you're so cultured. You're such a deep thinker...|
40176|#822$#If we're ambushed in battle, we'll cover each other, back to back.|
40177|#821$#Although I can be a little careless sometimes, but I don't miss important details.|
40178|#822$#If you encounter any problems during your adventures, don't hesitate to let me know!|
40179|#823$#If you meet someone that you get along with, add them all to your friends list!|
40180|#822$#Equipment comes in sets. If you wear a complete set, you'll benefit from some powerful bonuses!|
40181|#824$#I don't feel like you care about me...|
40182|#824$#Could it be that you've already found a new friend and don't want me anymore?|
40183|#824$#If you don't like me, just tell me...|
40184|#824$#Could it be that you've already found a new friend and don't want me anymore?|
40185|#824$#What did I do wrong? Why do you hate me so much?|
40186|#824$#I'm so glad that you still want to talk with me! I was worried I'd upset you...|
40187|#824$#You haven't talked to me in so long. I've been so sad lately...|
40188|#824$# I like you... I just think I'm too much for you.|
40189|#824$#Are you here to console me?|
40190|#824$#I always feel so lonely when I don't see you...|
40191|#823$#Whenever I see you, it makes me really happy!|
40192|#821$#Can't you stop fighting all the time? My heart would break if you got hurt...|
40193|#822$#Can you take me to higher ground? I'd like to see more of the landscape around here.|
40194|#821$#What are we going to do today? I can't wait!|
40195|#823$#You're so good to me! I'm really happy being with you!|
40196|#821$#Do you like me? Can't you at least tell me that?|
40197|#822$#If there's something on your mind, please tell me.|
40198|#822$#I can see it in your eyes... Is something worrying you?|
40199|#822$#As long as you tell me what you need, I'll do my best to help you.|
40200|#821$#If I become the enemy's target, will you protect me?|
40201|#822$#Hehe, do you think of me often?|
40202|#823$#I really admire those who risk their lives to heal others. They are the greatest!|
40203|#823$#You belong to me! I won't let anyone else have you!|
40204|#822$#From now on, you can only summon me. Deal?|
40205|#821$#The weather is foul, so make sure you bundle up! I don't want you catching a cold!|
40206|#823$#I'm really happy to just chat with you. It'll be great if everything could be like this forever...|
40207|#823$#Did you know the heroes of old wrote the secrets of their mastery in books? If you find them, they could make your skills even stronger.|
40208|#822$#I wonder if humans and Eidolons can fall in love with each other.|
40209|#823$#You're so good to me. What can I do for you in return?|
40210|#823$#Your favorite Eidolon is me, right?|
40211|#824$#I need my partner who cares for me!|
40212|#824$#I think spending time with you is really boring sometimes.|
40213|#824$#Do you doubt my skills?|
40214|#824$#You know what? Chatting with you is really difficult...|
40215|#824$#I don't think you mean to, but you're so cold towards me...|
40216|#824$#When you get into trouble, don't ask me to help you...|
40217|#824$#If you don't want to be poor, keep killing monsters and taking their loot!|
40218|#824$#Are you completely broke? Is that why you're dressed so shabbily?|
40219|#824$#I could win these battles without you.|
40220|#824$#You came looking for me because you're conscience was bothering you, right?|
40221|#822$#If you keep working at it, I'm sure your skills will improve!|
40222|#821$#I think you can handle these enemies pretty easily.|
40223|#822$#What's up? Is there something you want to discuss?|
40224|#821$#Heh! You're so adorable! I can't help but tease you!|
40225|#822$#Are you spreading foul rumors about me? Is that why everyone's been looking at me so strangely?|
40226|#821$#Come on! Go to more challenging places! How can you enjoy wasting so much time on weaklings?|
40227|#823$#You have to tell me if someone bullies you! I'll make sure they never do it again!|
40228|#824$#Offense is the best defense! Have you still not learned that?|
40229|#822$#You'll just have to act as my servant until your skills surpass mine!|
40230|#822$#You've improved unbelievably fast. You're finally qualified to fight alongside me.|
40231|#821$#When fortifying Lv.28+ weapons to 20, something amazing will happen. Go try it!|
40232|#822$#You should be honored that you can fight beside me!|
40233|#821$#What's the point of joining a Guild? You have to follow orders and pretend to be a decent person... that's definitely not my style!|
40234|#822$#If you can't keep up with me in battle, I may just leave you behind.|
40235|#821$#You're so cute. Never change!|
40236|#822$#Hehe, I didn't expect you to be that useful. I'm kinda impressed.|
40237|#821$#Looks like you need someone to protect you. When will you be able to stand on your own two feet?|
40238|#822$#I must be the most beautiful Eidolon... Do you think so? Hint: the correct answer is, "Yes, of course you are!"'|
40239|#821$#It's only natural for you to be good to me. After all, who else would you be good to?|
40240|#822$#You just go ahead and fight that nasty monster over there. I'll help out if I feel like it.|
41001|What's your biggest fear?|
41002|What are you afraid of?|
41003|#821$#I don't think that being afraid means you are weak,
#822$#I think it means you understand your limitations.|
41004|#824$#Afraid or not, I know I've gotta go all out and give a fight my best.|
41005|#822$#My strength comes from my friends.
#824$#My greatest fear is that something bad might happen to them.|
41006|#822$#Fear is a natural response to dangerous situations, and it can help keep you safe.
#821$#Just don't let your fears control you!|
41011|What's the secret to getting along with people?|
41012|How should I manage my relationships with other people?|
41013|#822$#It's best to be honest with others,
#821$#just like how you and I are!|
41014|#822$#It's tough when you don't know much about someone...
#821$#Maybe you should ask them about their hobbies!|
41015|#824$#Nothing is perfect, so don't force it if it isn't working out. You can't get along with everyone!|
41016|#821$#Just be yourself! That's all anyone can do.
#823$#If they don't like the real you, then what's the point?|
41021|What's your advice for going up against strong enemies?|
41022|How do you handle a tough opponent?|
41023|#822$#You need to go up against bigger baddies if you want to get stronger!
#823$#But don't get discouraged if you get whooped. Hone your skills and then try again!|
41024|#822$#Even the toughest enemy will have a weakness. Try watching the enemy for a bit to see how they fight.
#821$#You might be able to figure out their weakness before you even engage them.|
41025|#823$#You can beat up any tough guy so long as you have the right partner! Hint, hint...|
41026|#824$#If you're in over your head, get those feet moving and get out of there!
#821$#There's no shame in running from a fight you can't win. Valor isn't all that useful if it gets you killed!|
41031|What do you think it means to be courageous?|
41032|How would you define courage?|
41033|#822$#To be courageous is to persevere in the face of adversity!
#821$#Don't let anyone deter you from your goals! Fight for what you believe in!|
41034|#821$#Courage is smiling even when things are at their worst.|
41035|#823$#Courage is doing your best to protect the ones you love.|
41036|#824$#Real courage is facing the things you fear,
#824$#rather than pretending that you aren't afraid.|
41041|What should someone do when they make a mistake?|
41042|What's the best way to apologize?|
41043|#821$#It's best to fess up when you've made a mistake.
#824$#If you lie to protect yourself, you're undermining the trust those people had in you.|
41044|#824$#If you don't apologize, then things will just get worse.
#821$#If you're sincere, you'll find forgiveness.|
41045|#823$#A person who's willing to apologize is a brave person. Being able to acknowledge your mistakes is a noble trait.|
41046|#822$#It's not always about right or wrong. People can have different yet perfectly valid views on a subject.
#821$#Try to consider things from the other side!|
41051|Do you like all creatures?|
41052|Tell me about your views on life.|
41053|#822$#They say all life comes from the Cube of Gaia.
#822$#So, in that case, all life must be equal. Everything is a unique existence that cannot be replaced.|
41054|#823$#I like to interact with all kinds of creatures! Even without a common language, we can still communicate.|
41055|#821$#All life should be respected. Even those obnoxious bunnyhops...|
41056|#822$#It frustrates me that so few creatures can get along with one another.
#824$#If we could take the time to better understand one another, I think this would be a more peaceful world.|
41061|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
41062|What do you know about the Cube of Gaia?|
41063|#822$#It's said that the Cube of Gaia is buried somewhere,
#821$#and the energy emanating from it is responsible all sorts of miraculous things.|
41064|#821$#The legend says that the Cube of Gaia was used to create the Aura Kingdom, a perfect paradise.
#823$#There's no pain or sorrow there, just endless and eternal joy.|
41065|#822$#The energy from the Cube of Gaia is a vital part of this world.
#821$#The people with the ability to channel that energy are known as the Envoys of Gaia.|
41066|#824$#There are so many mysteries about how our many worlds came to be... There's so much that we still don't understand.|
41071|I want to know more about Masteries.|
41072|What can you tell me about Mastery?|
41073|#823$#Masteries provide useful boosts to your combat skills!|
41074|#821$#As you continue to increase in level, you'll automatically gain new Masteries!|
41075|#822$#Keep an eye out for Tokens! You'll get them for completing certain quests.
#821$#Once you have a bunch, talk to your Class Master in Navea. They'll teach you advanced Masteries in exchange for Tokens.|
41076|#823$#You're really something! They say only the greatest heroes can achieve Mastery.|
41081|Tell me about equipment.|
41082|I want to learn more about weapons and armor.|
41083|#823$#The staff is a powerful weapon, allowing you to manipulate the raw elemental forces of the world.|
41084|#822$#Be on the lookout for treasure chests dropped by enemies. You might find something rare and powerful!|
41085|#821$#Your weapons will wear down after a while. Don't forget to bring it in for repairs!|
41086|#821$#The Great Axe a great way to deal out a ton of damage in a short amount of time!|
41091|How do I send messages to people?|
41092|Can you tell me about mail and private chat?|
41093|#823$#You can easily send items and money to your buddies through the mail system.|
41094|#822$#If a message is rejected, it'll be saved for ten days. If you don't reclaim it by then, you'll lose any items or money attached to it!|
41095|#821$#You can switch to Private Chat by clicking the "R" button on the lower left hand corner of the Message Interface!|
41096|#821$#Remember to be polite! Nobody likes a jerk.|
41101|What is that combat style you use?|
41102|What's so special about your battle technique?|
41103|#822$#I invented this style myself! It's so fresh I haven't even named it yet!
#821$#Why don't you help me think of a name?|
41104|#822$#I combined martial arts and Lightning to create a rather... shocking set of techniques.
#823$#I can even paralyze giant monsters with it!|
41105|#821$#As a spirit, I'm not constrained by gravity. I can attack from any angle!|
41106|#823$#Hah! I knew you'd notice! My Electrical Storm attack is pretty awesome, isn't it?|
41111|Did you design your outfit yourself?|
41112|Tell me about your outfit.|
41113|#821$#Don't I look stylish?
#823$#The ingenious color coordination and stunning design has earned top marks from everyone who's seen it!|
41114|#821$#Hah! Some people have said that this outfit makes me look like an elegant (and dashing) transfer student from abroad!|
41115|#822$#This custom design is both form-fitting and aerodynamic, allowing me to kick butt in style!|
41116|#824$#What, do you think it looks bad?
#821$#Be honest! I'm really good at handling constructive criticism. (Meanie...)|
41121|What allows you to float like that?|
41122|Can I fly like you do?|
41123|#822$#It's very important to watch your weight; you definitely won't be able to fly if you're too heavy!
#821$#That's why I'm very careful about what I eat and drink. Why don't you give that a try?|
41124|#821$#I remember being told that these gizmos on my arms help me float.
#822$#If there were any more of them in existence, you could give them a try!|
41125|#821$#You need to be streamlined and aerodynamic.
#822$#Like¡K like...
#823$#Just like my hair! It was styled in a wind tunnel!|
41126|#824$#Gravity is all mental. Just focus hard enough and you'll be able to break free of it!|
41131|Are you friends with Merrilee?|
41132|What do you think about Merrilee?|
41133|#822$#W-Who told you about Merrilee? I deny everything!|
41134|#822$#Merrilee is...uh...it's hard to tell her how I feel.|
41135|#823$#Sigh... Merrilee is so dreamy... I'm smitten...|
41136|#822$#Man, what I wouldn't give to go out on a date with Merrilee!|
41141|What can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
41142|Have you heard any rumors about other Eidolons?|
41143|#824$#I haven't had the chance to chat with other Eidolons lately... Be sure to bring me along if you meet any of them!|
41144|#821$#Alessa's Horn Skewer ability deals all sorts of Holy damage!
#822$#I can't imagine what it'd be like to have such a powerful weapon growing out of my head.|
41145|#821$#Why, what have you heard? Did Merrilee say anything about me?
#822$#What? No, it's nothing. Really. I was just curious, that's all!|
41146|#821$#I like chatting with Grimm a lot! He's really optimistic and always finds nice things to say!
#823$#He's perfect to talk to when I'm not feeling so confident.|
41151|How does it feel to manipulate electricity like you do?|
41152|How does it feel to generate lightning?|
41153|#823$#Electricity is no different to me than air or blood. My entire body is like a battery!
#823$#As a bonus, I can move just as quick as lightning can! Zoom!|
41154|#822$#Because electricity is second nature to me, I sometimes forget just how strong it can be.
#821$#Sometimes I get surprised by how powerful my attacks are! ...But I'm not bragging.|
41155|#821$#Generating lightning feels a heckuva lot better than getting struck by it!|
41156|#824$#Sometimes it's a bit tingly, like when your foot falls asleep.|
41161|What are those rings around your arms?|
41162|Can you tell me about those rings you wear on your arms?|
41163|#822$#These bad boys don't just look good - they're where my strength comes from!
#821$#They let me pull electricity out of the air, store it up, and then release it in attacks. Neat, huh?|
41164|#821$#I don't know if they have a name, I've always just called them my Power Rings.
#822$#They give me the ability to fly, and they also let me store up electrical energy.|
41165|#823$#An excellent question! These two power rings are the source of my power!|
41166|#824$#I've just always had them. No one has been able to tell me who made them or even where they came from.|
41171|Why do you keep looking at the forest?|
41172|How do you feel about the forest?|
41173|#821$#Forests make me happy! I love the soft breezes that drift through the trees.
#823$#Ah... it feels so good...|
41174|#821$#I feel at peace when I watch a tree swaying in the wind.
#823$#It makes me long to sit under those trees with a loved one, talking and laughing the day away.|
41175|#822$#I try and talk to the woodland creatures whenever I can.
#821$#They always have the most unusual gossip!|
41176|#824$#Flying through the forest relaxes me! I can drift for hours without a care in the world.|
41181|How is it that you are always so full of life?|
41182|Why are you always so energetic?|
41183|#821$#I get my energy from my optimism!
#823$#What's the point of getting tired when so many wonderful things are just waiting to be found?|
41184|#822$#Adventuring with you always fills me with energy.
#821$#Our bond of friendship is the source of my power!|
41185|#822$#Ha! I adore the fact that every day brings new discoveries and experiences!
#821$#With this much curiosity, it's difficult to ever be tired! Or bored!|
41186|#824$#I get tired just like anyone else. I'll rest for 10 minutes or so a day. It seems like such a waste, though...|
41191|What would you do if we separated?|
41192|This adventure can't go on forever. What do you do afterwards?|
41193|#822$#Split up? You can be such a downer sometimes! Yeesh...
#821$#I suppose if we had to part ways, I'd always hold onto the memory of our time together.|
41194|#822$#If you were gone, I'd try and find Merr... Uh... No, nevermind. Forget I said anything.|
41195|#821$#I'd be sad, but I wouldn't let that keep me down! I'd still travel the world and try and help those in need.|
41196|#824$#It's not like we'd never see one another again, right? Our friendship goes too deep to just disappear like that.|
41301|What type of boys do you like?|
41302|Who would be your ideal boyfriend?|
41303|#823$Oooh! You're gonna make me blush! #822$How can a lady like me answer such a bold question, hehe!|
41304|#821$Hmmm, I...I think a dashing, tall gentleman would be right for me. #823$I hope that's not too cliche!|
41305|#822$Hmm...My ideal boyfriend would be kind, gentle, thoughtful...and love snakes, just like me, hehe! #823$I hope that's not asking for too much...|
41306|#822$Someone who's even half as kind and generous as you would be perfect!|
41311|What should I do if I come across an incredibly powerful foe?|
41312|If I ever come up against an eneny stronger than I am, what's the best thing to do?|
41313|#821$#As long as we're teamed up together, I bet we can take on even the toughest of opponents! #822$#When I call upon the Power of Love, your HP will regenerate. It's a foolproof plan, no doubt about it!|
41314|#821$#With my icy attacks I'll distract the enemy long enough for you to come up with a cunning plan! #822$#Once you've established your strategy, we'll take 'em down together, I know it!|
41315|#823$#Don't worry at all! Hehe! If we team up to use our ultimate combo, we're nearly unstoppable! We can do anything together!|
41316|#822$#You keep a stock of HP potions on hand, don't you? You should keep some just in case there is an emergency. I want you to be safe!|
41321|Is there anything I should know about your weapon?|
41322|Does your staff have any secret power?|
41323|#821$#My staff is critical to my abilities, I never leave home without it. #822$#You'll never see me separated from my staff - it's almost like it's part of me!|
41324|#822$#My staff was created by the power of love that gathers in the Aura Kingdom. #821$#The more I use it, the more powerful it becomes! I hope to use it to spread love across all worlds.|
41325|#821$#Being straight from the Aura Kingdom, my staff greatly increases my magical capabilities. #822$#It's especially attuned to my ice magic, making me even more powerful!|
41326|#822$#Do you see the head of the staff? It looks just like a snake, hehe! I love snakes, so it's totally a great fit, don't you think?|
41331|What kind of food do you like most?|
41332|What's your favorite food?|
41333|#822$#Hmm, that's a tough one...I really do love sweet, red apples! #823$#I feel really healthy and rejuvenated when I bite into a crisp apple.|
41334|#822$#Most of all, I loooove fruits! Apples are my favorite!|
41335|#821$#My favorite is definitely apples - big, juicy, red apples! They're so sweet, I can't stop eating!#822$#Would you like one too? I'll happily share!|
41336|#823$#Can you guess? It's a fruit that's as beautiful as a ruby and has the perfect crisp, sweet taste! Why, of course, it's an apple!|
41341|Is there anything in particular that you just can't stand?|
41342|Is there anything you don't like?|
41343|#824$#One of the things I can't stand is a bad hair day! #824$#If I see a split end...I get so mad for the rest of the day! I have to get a trim as soon as possible!|
41344|#822$#I really don't like people who don't take the time to wash their hair... #824$#It's so gross! How can they stand that feeling?|
41345|#824$#Strong gusts of wind can be pretty bad. #824$#When it messes up my painstakingly styled hair, I could just scream!|
41346|#824$#Rainy days are the worst - I feel so grumpy when my hair gets soaked!|
41351|What type of animals do you like?|
41352|What's your favorite animal?|
41353|#821$#Maybe it's weird but...I really like snakes! #823$#With their cute little eyes and flicking tongues... I just love them!|
41354|#822$#I actually really like snakes! I think they're very graceful creatures...|
41355|#821$#In my opinion, snakes are some of the most beautiful creatures. #824$#I don't understand why people say they're evil - I've learned to appreciate all things in nature!|
41356|#821$#Slithering swiftly and flicking their tongues... I'd love to taste the air like a snake does! #823$#Hehe, I bet it would be fun to be a snake for a day!|
41361|What do you think of Terra?|
41362|Do you know any interesting things about Terra?|
41363|#822$#Avians have a thing for the mystery that dark gods tend to present. #822$#As a result, the other tribes tend not to trust the Avians.|
41364|#821$#Dwarvish craftsmen are the best machinists in the world! #823$#I've heard their work can rival even that of the greatest artists.|
41365|#822$#There are so many different races in Terra! The Dwarves, the Makar, the Gnomes... #821$#They're all quite different, with their own beliefs and their own customs. Isn't the world amazing?|
41366|#822$#I've heard that, sometimes, an angel or demon loses its way and arrives in Terra...|
41371|Tell me the legend of the Cube of Gaia.|
41372|I want to learn about the Cube of Gaia.|
41373|#822$#As the legend goes, the Cube of Gaia once held open the pathways between the three worlds. #822$#That's part of why there are so many different cultures and beliefs.|
41374|#821$#All living things, good and evil alike, are connected to the Cube of Gaia.|
41375|#822$#Eidolons have a particularly strong link to the Cube of Gaia, allowing them to create new items. #823$#Given how powerful the Cube of Gaia is, it is no surprise these items are often powerful and rare!|
41376|#821$#It's said that the Cube of Gaia is not just an energy source... It truly is an item of mystery that not even us Eidolons are sure about...|
41381|What's a HP Potion used for?|
41382|Please tell me about HP Potions.|
41383|#821$#HP Potions can restore your HP! They're a necessity for any serious adventurer. Mhm!|
41384|#822$#Merchants in the various towns and cities sell HP Potions, but you'll obviously need money if you want them. Let's make money together!|
41385|#821$#HP Potions need time to work to their fullest, so it's important to use them at the right moment! Don't wait until it's too late!|
41386|#823$#There are level restrictions to HP Potions, so don't waste money buying HP Potions that don't match your level!|
41391|Do you know what Experience Crystals are used for?|
41392|Please tell me about Experience Crystals.|
41393|#821$#You can obtain Experience Crystals by defeating monsters! They're a great source of strength for Eidolons like me.|
41394|#822$#Be sure not to misplace all the Experience Crystals you find, ok? If you give them to your Eidolons, they'll gain some EXP!|
41395|#821$#High quality Experience Crystals give Eidolons even greater EXP. I hope you can find some for me!|
41396|#822$#An Experience Crystal can be given to an Eidolon to increase that Eidolon's EXP.|
41401|Why do you manipulate ice?|
41402|Why specialize in Ice Magic?|
41403|#824$#I'm not really sure why I'm most skilled with ice magic... #822$#But, whatever works! It helps that my staff is perfect for boosting that type of power.|
41404|#822$#I was able to manipulate ice and cold soon after I was born. #821$#I guess... Maybe, this is fate? Hehe!|
41405|#823$#Well... I've tried to use other kinds, but my staff really only enhances Ice Magic, so I decided to stick with it!|
41406|#821$#An icy, adorable appearance and the freshness of youth... #823$#Isn't that an irresistible combination for Humans? Hehe!|
41411|How do you care for your hair?|
41412|What are your hair care secrets?|
41413|#821$#The hair grows on the scalp, therefore you must start from the scalp if you want to have beautiful hair. #822$#As long as you massage your scalp daily, your hair will be beautiful!|
41414|#821$#The secret to hair care is, of course, regular brushing. #823$#Brushing the hair not only keeps it clean and neat, but it also strengthens the hair!|
41415|#823$#Keeping my hair moisturized is easy! Hehe! Not all my magic is battle oriented, you know.|
41416|#822$#Early to bed, early to rise, and a lot of work. There's no other way to maintain my hair's shine.|
41421|I want to know how it feels to fly.|
41422|What is it like to fly?|
41423|#821$#Flying is like being in love... #823$#It feels wild and free, yet wholly terrifying and... Oh gosh, I'm blushing!|
41424|#821$#The feeling of flight is like young love... #823$#Even when things are the same, they feel fresh and new!|
41425|#821$#The best moment is when you reach the peak of your flight and can see the world spread out below you. It is like you've abandoned all your problems on that tiny world beneath you...|
41426|#822$#Flying feels amazing, I wish I could fly together with you! It'd be so much fun!|
41431|Do you have a favorite hairstyle?|
41432|Why'd you choose this hairstyle?|
41433|#821$#I heard there's a really good singer with this hairstyle. #823$#Maybe you'd like to hear me sing? I'm good, I promise!|
41434|#823$#Twintails are playful and cute! I think they suit an innocent maiden like me best, tee hee!|
41435|#824$#Hmm? Are you asking because you don't like my hairstyle? Be honest!|
41436|#822$#Oh my gosh! You don't like twintails, do you? Oooh! I knew it!|
41441|Do you know any secrets about the other Eidolons?|
41442|Got any juicy Eidolon gossip?|
41443|#824$#I think Serif has a fever. #822$#How do I know? Well, every time we talk, his face is always so red, and he's sweating...|
41444|#821$#Serif's nickname is "The Eternal Youth." Don't you think that name really suits him? It's pretty cute!|
41445|#824$#Grimm might be a great conversationalist, but he's also got quite a temper. I'm a little scared of him... #822$#Don't tell him that I said that, eek!|
41446|#822$#The Regal Unicorn has an irresistible charm... #823$#I kind of want to ride Alessa and see what it's like... Do you think she'd let me?|
41451|What kind of Eidolon is Serif?|
41452|What do you think of Serif?|
41453|#822$#Serif? I thought he'd be really witty and funny, but he's always stammering every time we speak...#824$#Do you think I bother him?|
41454|#821$#Serif is really very sweet. I think he's a great friend!|
41455|#821$#I've seen Serif fight - he looks like a skilled warrior!|
41456|#822$#Serif is one of my most reliable friends! #823$#I hope our friendship will last forever and ever and ever!|
41461|What do you think of love?|
41462|Do you have any insight on love?|
41463|#822$#To love another may seem easy in theory, but it's hard in practice...|
41464|#823$#I believe true love is hard to find, so the happiest moment in your life will be meeting that special someone. #823$#If you've already met them, you should cherish them and the time you spend together.|
41465|#821$#Love is a medicine that nourishes one's heart, and an essential element of life. #822$#You shouldn't waste your time, have you found your one, true love?|
41466|#822$#Looking for love can help a person grow, but it can also break a person's heart. #821$#Still, no matter what your opinion of love, you must hold on to hope! Stay positive!|
41471|Why do you carve ice roses?|
41472|Why do you like roses so much?|
41473|#823$#Well... because roses have a special meaning, you know?|
41474|#821$#Roses signify love, blue is the color of miracles... #823$#Love is filled with miracles! Isn't that a romantic message? Hehe!|
41475|#822$#An ice rose says that no matter how icy cold someone's heart is, a passionate love can melt it! #823$#Isn't a flower with that message beautiful?|
41476|#822$#A rose can be used to say so many things without uttering a single word! #821$#What other flower has such an awesome power?|
41481|What secrets do your armbands hold?|
41482|Can you tell me about your armbands?|
41483|#821$#The Freezing Armbands change their rotation based on my mood, which, in turn, gives me power. #822$#When they're spinning at top speed, I can even create a blizzard!|
41484|#823$#The Freezing Armbands help making controlling ice easier. Thanks to it, my Ice Magic is the most powerful!|
41485|#821$#The Freezing Armbands grow as my power does! #822$#Would you believe they were no bigger than a string when I first got them? #823$#Pretty impressive, huh?  Hehe!|
41486|#822$# I don't really know for sure where they came from, haha! I guess it must have come from the Cube of Gaia?|
41491|If we parted ways, what would you do next?|
41492|What would you do if we went our separate ways?|
41493|#824$#Ohh, can we not talk about such sad things...?|
41494|#824$#If we part, my magic and my willpower might vanish... I hope it never happens!|
41495|#824$#You don't...hate me, do you? Why would you ask something like that!?|
41496|#824$#We've gotta stick together! I can't imagine my life without you! Please, let's be friends always!|
41601|What's your favorite season?|
41602|Do you prefer any particular season?|
41603|#822$#Not that fond of winter, I gotta say. #822$#Cold weather makes me want to just eat cookies and hibernate.|
41604|#822$#Huh? Why are you asking me this so suddenly? #822$#Is this a pop quiz?|
41605|#821$#Summer's my favorite season. #823$#The heat really gets me fired up, y'know?|
41606|#823$#Summer makes me feel all energetic, like my flame can burn even hotter!|
41611|What kinds of things do you dream about?|
41612|Let's talk about dreams.|
41613|#824$#Wellll, I did have this super bad nightmare the other night. #824$#I dreamed that instead of fire, I could only breathe soft, gentle clouds. Yuck!|
41614|#822$#Did you know that not just humans dream? All the sentient races dream. Even spirits can dream.|
41615|#821$#When I was still in my egg, I dreamed of this big fireball. #822$#It had giant burning eyes and blew stuff up all the time! #823$#It must've been my very first inspiration!|
41616|#821$#Dreams? Our adventures together are more action-packed than anything I've dreamed about.|
41621|What do you think 'adventure' really is?|
41622|What does 'adventure' mean to you?|
41623|#824$#I'm too tired to talk about adventuring...maybe we fought a couple bad guys too many today.|
41624|#822$#Adventure is about pushing yourself, but not overdoing it. #821$#If you push yourself too hard, you'll be too exhausted to go on more adventures.|
41625|#822$#Fighting with your friends, sharing the great times and the not-so-hot times...#821$#Yeaaaah, that's totally the spirit of adventure, right?|
41626|#823$#Any time I'm with you is a real adventure.|
41631|What are the benefits of traveling?|
41632|What can we learn when we travel?|
41633|#824$#Is it bad that I had to really think about the good points of traveling with you?|
41634|#822$#New lands to explore, new folks to meet, new combustible things to burn...#821$#That's what I like best about traveling!|
41635|#822$#It's all about changing your pace! #821$#If you don't like where you're at, you can just hit the road and leave it all behind to find somewhere new!|
41636|#823$#When we travel, we grow. Every day we travel, we're wiser than the day before, right?|
41641|Do you like animals?|
41642|What do you think of animals?|
41643|#824$#Before we talk about caring for animals, how about taking care of me?|
41644|#824$#Animals kind of annoy me. Because of them, too many people think of me as a pet. #824$#C'mon, the all-time greatest Eidolon isn't gonna fetch a stick, people!|
41645|#822$#Animals and humans share the world. #822$#Humans shouldn't take advantage of animals so much in ways that benefit only them.|
41646|#821$#Best animal of all time? Dragons, obviously. #823$#One day, when you look up 'awesome dragons', my picture will be right there.|
41651|Heard any good gossip lately?|
41652|Have the spirits said anything about what's happening elsewhere?|

41654|#824$#Recently, I heard that something happened that really dropped the Templars' morale to an all-time low.|
41655|#822$#The Mirabelle Group is an organization that hires people to solve clients' problems. #821$#If you have the time and skill, you can make good money helping folks in need.|
41656|#822$#There are rare monsters all over the world! #822$#If you defeat them and bring proof, the regional guards will give you a nice reward.|
41661|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
41662|What do you know about the Cube of Gaia?|
41663|#822$#I feel like part of my existence is tied to you, but the other part's tied to the Cube. #821$#You and I both have the power of Gaia, but it's something else, too...|
41664|#822$#The spirits say that the Cube of Gaia helped make a buncha worlds. #821$#Each one has its own rules and laws and stuff.|
41665|#822$#The Cube of Gaia is what inspired people to discover all the magic and technology the world has today. Neat, huh?|
41666|#824$#All spirits who become Eidolons know of the Cube of Gaia, but none of us know why it's here.|
41671|Let's talk about Quests.|
41672|Could you tell me more about Quests?|
41673|#823$#Look for exclamation marks on your map - that means someone wants to make a request of you.|
41674|#823$#Helping people in need always feels good deep down inside. That or I have some bad gas today.|
41675|#823$#Click on the little image beside the map to take on quests you haven't taken yet!|

41683|#823$#You can use the Energy Secret Stones that monsters drop to fortify other types of Secret Stones!|
41684|#822$#As your own level goes up, so will the maximum fortification level of your Secret Stones.|
41685|#823$#You can sometimes get Rare Secret Stones from killing bosses, so let's be sure to kill a lot of them, okay?|
41686|#821$#The Secret Stones you can buy from Secret Stone Merchants all over the world sometimes have strange magic properties. That's super cool!|
41691|What's the point of the Eidolon Area?|
41692|Tell me about the Eidolon Area.|
41693|#822$#You just might become cool enough that other Eidolons think you're worth lending their power tot. #821$#If you wanna learn more about them, that's where you'll wanna look!|
41694|#822$#Once an Eidolon's level is high enough - and if you've got the right items - they can evolve! #823$#Once an Eidolon evolves, they'll become even more powerful!|
41695|#823$#When you're not fightin', you can change who you've got with you in the Eidolon Area.|
41696|#822$#You can gift EXP Crystals to Eidolons by feeding them, #821$#and you can also give Elemental Symbols to improve an Eidolons' skills!|
41701|Do you like the sun and the moon?|
41702|Do you like our world's cycle of day and night?|
41703|#822$#When I'm in a huff, looking at the sun or moon makes me feel better. #821$#Dunno why - maybe their gravity just pulls my problems away.|
41704|#823$#Well, any day's a pretty good day if we can relax and enjoy the sunset, right?|
41705|#821$#Sometimes, I feel like maybe if I focus real hard, I can control the sun and the moon. #823$#Maybe one day it'll come true!|
41706|#821$#This world depends on the balance of day and night. If you didn't have that, things would get outta whack pretty quick.|
41711|What's it like to be a fire expert?|
41712|How does it feel to play with fire?|
41713|#822$#Sometimes breathing fire is an problem, y'know? #824$#I've burned up more things by sneezing than I can count.|
41714|#822$#When it comes to handling fire, I'm the tops! #823$#Or, y'know, top three at the worst.|
41715|#823$#It's like every battle is a barbecue!|
41716|#821$#Imagine if you could suck all your anger into your lungs, then blow it at bad people. It's kind of like that!|
41721|Do you have a bad temper?|
41722|Do you ever get really mad?|
41723|#822$#H-hey, what's with that question? #821$#We've been together long enough that I'm sure you already know.|
41724|#824$#Well, you know how sometimes I go wild during a fight and beat foes into the ground...|
41725|#824$#So I get frustrated sometimes. So what? I keep it under control. Mostly. #822$#...Are you still mad about the burns?|
41726|#821$#When I get really angry, I just want to incinerate someone! #823$#It's like hitting them with rage that makes them go away forever!|
41731|You're kind of sensitive about your size, right?|
41732|Will you ever get any bigger?|
41733|#821$#Even you're calling me small now? My #1 partner who's supposed to have my back? Say it ain't so!|
41734|#822$#I totally endorse that ancient saying: "Size doesn't matter."|
41735|#822$#I'll be as big as a tree someday - no - even bigger than a tree! #821$#Then, no one will call me small, ever!|
41736|#821$#Once I grow up, my fire will burn so hot I'll be able to melt rocks or magic rings! #823$#Everyone will want me as their Eidolon then.|
41741|Tell me about the other Eidolons.|
41742|Heard any rumors about the other Eidolons?|
41743|#823$#Next time I see them, I'll chat and dig up some dirt for you.|
41744|#822$#Merrilee tries to look all dainty, but she can be a real thug! #821$#She keeps healing people so they can beat up their opponents forever!|
41745|#822$#Alessa never misses a chance to boast about how fast she can gallop. #823$#She IS fast, yeah, but she doesn't have a pair of wings!|
41746|#821$#Keep it under your hat, but Serif has had a huge crush on Merrilee for aaaaages! #822$#Merrilee's so oblivious to his feelings, though.|
41751|What sort of power do you have hidden within you?|
41752|When will your powers fully awaken?|
41753|#822$#I sure wish I knew... #824$#I look forward to when I become a full-fledged dragon.|
41754|#821$#It sounds weird to say, but I feel like as long as we stick together, I have unlimited potential. #822$#I just hope I can control unlimited potential!|
41755|#822$#I can feel my power getting stronger as we fight. #823$#I hope it's a sign that I'll fully awaken soon.|
41756|#823$#When I fully awaken, you'll have the power of a super dragon on your side. Who's gonna win against us?|
41761|Let's talk about Dragons.|
41762|What do you think of Dragons?|
41763|#823$#There are tons of different kinds of spirits and creatures out there, but dragons are totally the best.|
41764|#821$#I'm glad I was born a dragon. Anything else would've been like a silver medal.|
41765|#821$#There's an old legend that says if you climb to the top of a certain waterfall, you can become a dragon. #822$#I think it's just a metaphor for overcoming challenges, but it'd be rad if it was real, huh?|
41766|#824$#There's always someone who thinks that dragons are just big, flying lizards. What are they smoking? #822$ If I meet those people, I'll set 'em straight - with a little flame, maybe.|
41771|What do you think is the most incredible thing in the world?|
41772|What's your most marvelous experience you've had?|
41773|#822$#Uh...just between you and me, I'm amazed every time I realize I can blow fire through my nostrils!|
41774|#822$#Whenever I can feel the power within me growing, it's really strange, but in a good way. #821$#It's hard to explain with words.|
41775|#822$#Meeting you, of course! #821$#Don't you think our destined meeting was totally magical and stuff?|
41776|#822$#I'm always amazed by the way people keep searching for happiness. #824$#They go through so many hardships, but hope keeps them going each day.|
41781|Have you ever actually walked on your legs?|
41782|Can you walk? I've never seen you do it.|
41783|#822$#Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever tried.|
41784|#821$#If you could fly all the time, would YOU bother walking?|
41785|#824$#Whoever told you that I scoot across the floor like a lame duck, that's 100% false. How uncool!|
41786|#822$#I guess if I had to walk, I probably could. Maybe we'll find out one day.|
41791|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
41792|What plans do you have after we part ways?|
41793|#822$#You 'n me, we're friends to the end. We'll never be apart, right?|
41794|#822$#I guess I'd continue traveling to new places. #821$#My biggest dream is to explore everything in the world!|
41795|#824$#Isn't it a bit too early to think about things like this? #822$#There are really important questions we should focus on, like whether pancakes or waffles are the superior breakfast.|
41796|#822$#It'd make me sad, but who can say what destiny has in store for us? #824$#I'd remember our time together fondly and face the future without dragon my feet!|
41901|What do you like to do for fun?|
41902|How do you usually kill time?|
41903|#822$#I adore exercising! It's so good for your health, don't you agree?|
41904|#822$#I just love moving as fast as I can!
#821$#As long as you push yourself, it is so easy to forget all your worries!|
41905|#821$#Hehe! That's a good question!
#823$#My answer is, of course, exercise!|
41906|#822$#I just love to fly!
#823$#You should come with me next time!|
41911|What is your favorite food?|
41912|What do you normally eat?|
41913|#824$#Not carrots. I'm normally not that picky, but please don't confuse me with a normal pony!|
41914|#822$#Hmm... what do I like to eat...
#821$#A nice, crisp salad is always pretty tasty.|
41915|#821$#Grass shoots with morning dew are my absolute favorite! 
#823$#They taste even better after a good run!|
41916|#822$#One can never have too much fiber and vitamins in their diet.
#821$#As such, I love fresh picked vegetables and fruits!|
41921|What do you dislike?|
41922|What kind of things do you hate?|
41923|#822$#Hypocritical people are just annoying. Why can't they stop?|
41924|#822$#I really hate liars. 
#824$#How wonderful this world would be if we all stopped lying.|
41925|#821$#Sin in the name of virtue is like poisoned sugar - it's sweet, but still fatal. 
#823$#False righteousness is absolutely unforgivable!|
41926|#822$#The most annoying thing is when I'm outside and it starts to rain all of a sudden... 
#824$#My mane becomes such a mess, and it takes forever to fix. Ugh.|
41931|What do you think friends are for?|
41932|What do you think of friendship?|
41933|#822$#Friendship is like a flower with light fragrance - a pleasant, long-lasting scent.|
41934|#821$#Friends should care for each other. You already knew this though, right?|
41935|#821$# Friendship is a wonderful, but elusive, thing. It's rare, and, if you miss it, it may never come back to you. 
#823$#So, make sure you cherish your friendships!|
41936|#823$#Lovers and family can also make good friends. 
#821$#Such a connection can never be imitated.|
41941|What do you think justice is?|
41942|What is justice to you?|
41943|#821$#Justice is praising the good and punishing the evil.|
41944|#822$#Justice means no favoritism and no impropriety.|
41945|#823$#Justice is like my Horn of Judgement. It will not forgive sin!|
41946|#823$#People like you, with a full sense of right and wrong, are already the best embodiment of justice!|
41951|Let's talk about the other races.|
41952|What do you know about some of the other races?|
41953|#821$#This world is very large, with so many different kinds of life! 
#822$#Don't assume that every other race is just like Humans!|
41954|#822$#The Makar are very proud, and look down on everybody else. 
#824$#I'm not very good at getting along with them.|
41955|#822$#The Dwarves have developed some amazing technology! 
#823$#No other race can match them!|
41956|#823$#Gnomes may not look very impressive, but they'll ruin you if you underestimate them.|
41961|Where do you like to vacation?|
41962|Tell me of some good tourist spots.|
41963|#822$#Many fierce monsters live north of Midgard. 
#824$#Oh, wait, you asked about GOOD sightseeing locations....|
41964|#822$#Is the Silverash Shore at the Helonia Coast really made of silvery ash? I'd really like to see it!|
41965|#821$#I would love to take a stroll through the forest near Port Skandia.|
41966|#821$#Shopping in Navea certainly satisfies even the pickiest consumer! 
#823$#With such a large business district - and an auction house! - you can definitely buy quality goods.|
41971|I would like to know about skills.|
41972|Please tell me about skills.|
41973|#822$#As you gain levels, you'll gradually learn new skills!|
41974|#821$#The Bard's healing skills are really helpful, especially for adventures!|
41975|#823$#You can learn new Masteries when you conclude contracts with Eidolons.|
41976|#824$#Some monsters may have weak attacks, but they can still surprise you!|
41981|What good is a backpack?|
41982|Please tell me what to use my backpack for.|
41983|#821$#You can disassemble useless equipment into Fragments.|
41984|#822$#Every competent adventurer should have a durable backpack to carry their loot in.|
41985|#823$#If you run out of room in your backpack, you can always buy a bigger one from the Item Mall.|
41986|#823$#You can use the Automatic Stacking function of your backpack to quickly organize it.|
41991|Let's talk about equipment.|
41992|What do you know about weapons and armor?|
41993|#821$# The Sword and Shield works for both offense and defense. They are very reliable during an encounter.|
41994|#823$# The equipment you buy from the store has a chance to include an enchantment!|
41995|#822$# Those who use Dual Pistols can shoot in two different directions at once. I think that's amazing!|
41996|#823$# As long as the same equipment is fortified, its strength will improve.|
42001|How do you keep your hair so soft and silky?|
42002|Can you give me some tips on how to keep my hair looking great?|
42003|#822$# Hmm, my hair is quite shiny! I'm so glad you noticed!
#821$# I feel proud for having such beautiful hair. It makes me happy every time I feel the breeze roll through it.|
42004|#821$# The key to great hair is diligence!
#823$# I spend a lot of time on it each and every day. That's why it looks as good as it does.|
42005|#821$# Ah, you are not the first one to notice my gorgeous hair.
#823$# The last person to praise my locks wanted to open a salon in my name!|
42006|#823$# Let me give you some advice: wash your hair every morning and let it air dry. You'll definitely see results!|
42011|What is the purpose of your horn?|
42012|What are some of your horn's abilities?|
42013|#822$#Despite what my family may say, my horn is not used to dry clothes!
#824$#So, next time you're doing laundry while I'm around, don't even think about it!|
42014|#821$#Its main function is to pass fair justice to all under trial.|
42015|#822$#Sometimes, when I walk in the dark,
#823$#my horn will shine, making it easy to move in the proper direction!|
42016|#821$#Sometimes my horn will glow on its own, out of my control.
#823$#For as long as I can remember, I've wondered if my horn is its own entity.|
42021|I wonder what it feels like to fly.|
42022|What is it like to soar through the clouds so freely?|
42023|#822$#It's a shame that you can't fly. It looks easy, but it's actually quite difficult to master!|
42024|#821$#Once you get down the basic mechanics, flying is a breeze! It's...hard to explain, though.|
42025|#822$#The only thing that makes me happier than flying is running. I love the exhilaration of a good gallop.
#823$#Oh wait, I guess I fly and run at the same time...|
42026|#821$#People ask me all the time how I can fly without wings.
#823$#I don't understand why they would even ask that. I mean, isn't it obvious?|
42031|Let's talk about your thoughts on responsibility.|
42032|What is your drive in life?|
42033|#822$#Responsibility? I'm not sure if I'm in the mood for such a serious discussion.|
42034|#821$#Well, have you ever pondered about your place in this world?
#822$#Perhaps now is a good time to give it some thought!|
42035|#821$#Everyone has responsibilities and obligations; that's a fact of life.
#823$#No matter what your purpose in life is, the most important thing to do is to make the most out of each and every day.|
42036|#821$#To me, properly representing divine glory in the justice I carry out makes each day meaningful.
#823$#That is my purpose in this world.|
42041|Let's chat about your fondness for running.|
42042|What's it like to run so freely?|
42043|#824$#Running is not just a physical exercise, but an emotional one as well.
#821$#When I want to get away from it all, I just take off, letting my physical pace match the rhythm of my heart!|
42044|#822$#If galloping leaves you exhausted, then you have not realized its full healing potential.|
42045|#823$#Galloping with all you have is so invigorating! I feel fortunate that I'm able to enjoy it so much.|
42046|#821$#When you keep at your fastest pace, everything around you is a blur, freeing your mind from distractions.
#823$#You focus on your racing heart, your pounding soul, your thoughts clearer than they've ever been!|
42051|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42052|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42053|#822$#Oh, so you're in the mood for some gossip? Let me share a few stories with you...|
42054|#822$#It's always nice talking with Grimm. He speaks with such vitality! 
#824$#It's too bad that he can get childish at times. Every once in a while it's funny, but usually it's just annoying.|
42055|#821$#Serif is a very reliable fighter. He's so agile and nimble; I can always count on him when I'm in a bind.
#823$#One of these days, I'm going to ask him for some combat advice.|
42056|#824$#There's this... intensity about Merrilee that always makes me feel a bit nervous...|
42061|What do you think is better about having four legs?|
42062|Is there anything special about your horse shoes?|
42063|#824$#You know, you're the first one to ask me anything about my wonderful hooves. Why is that?|
42064|#822$#I suppose the only real benefit about having four legs is that you run a lot faster.|
42065|#821$#My hoofbeat clops like the hammer of a gavel, thrumming the pace of justice!
#823$#Perhaps I should become a poet! Do you agree?|
42066|#823$#I run three times faster than the fastest normal horse! Isn't that amazing? I think so!
#821$#O-oh, my proof? Hmm, well, I don't have that on me right now, but I'll show it to you later...|
42071|What do you think about while we're fighting together?|
42072|What do you think about fighting?|
42073|#821$#I always think about how lucky I am to fight at your side. It is my greatest honor.|
42074|#824$#Senseless violence only brings hurt and shame. Unfortunately, life flourishing without the need for defense is unavoidable.
#821$#It's a necessary evil, I suppose. Such a pity.|
42075|#822$#I dislike fighting; so much pain and sorrow comes from it. 
#823$#However, I will not hesitate to use Holy Skewer if it's to defend against evil!|
42076|#823$# If it's for you and justice, I will give my all with every fight!|
42081|Tell me about your armor.|
42082|What do you think about wearing armor?|
42083|#822$#Children seem to love my head gear with its bright colors!
#823$#It makes me chuckle to think about someone else trying to wear my armor.|
42084|#822$#My gold armor is my favorite for defense.
#821$#That and my agility are what protect me from major harm.|
42085|#821$#My armor is so light! That's why I can move so freely.
#823$#Imagine how much faster I could run without all this gear on!|
42086|#823$# Some people say I look better without the armor. Do you agree?|
42091|If you and I were separated...|
42092|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
42093|#824$# Can we not talk about this? It's so sad!|
42094|#824$#If we were ever to truly, permanently separate from each other, 
#824$#I would probably disappear from this world.|
42095|#822$#If I were to disappear, please don't be sad.
#821$#My spirit will always be with you.|
42096|#824$#On the day we part, I want you to know that I wish you happiness.|
42201|How do you normally train?|
42202|How do you improve your skills?|
42203|#822$#The best training starts with basics.
#823$#Master the basics and everything else will come to you.|
42204|#821$#I train more than my skills. I also train my spirit through meditation.|
42205|#823$#Life is about strength. That is why you must train endlessly.|
42206|#823$#Every moment of leisure is a moment of training lost. Growing strong is nothing special. It is simply effort applied.
#824$#Anyone who believes otherwise is a fool.|
42211|Do you have any weaknesses?|
42212|What is your greatest fear?|
42213|#821$#Fear? I cannot feel fear.
#823$#I will also never surrender.|
42214|#822$#Weaknesses belong to the weak.|
42215|#824$#I am Gigas. I have no need of fears.
#823$#Please, do not insult me.|
42216|#821$#I have told an untruth. I do understand fear.
#823$#I fear that no challenges will remain for me to face one day. Ha. Ha.|
42221|Do you prefer the mountains or the sea?|
42222|Would you rather vacation in the cool mountains or the sunny sea?|
42223|#822$#The mountains.
#823$#The beach is not known for fearsome opponents.|
42224|#821$#As beautiful as this body is, I think the mountains are right.
#824$#The beach sand may compromise my joints.|
42225|#824$#I cannot abide the beach. So many people indulging in sloth, laying about and sunning themselves.
#822$#Where is the discipline? Where is the self-control?|
42226|#822$#If I had to choose, the mountains.
#821$#You would be better served by training than going to either place, though.|
42231|Do you know how to be gentle?|
42232|What do you think of gentle people?|
42233|#823$#I know a little of being gentle. For example, I never let my opponents suffer.|
42234|#821$#It is strange. Gentle people often seem to fear me.
#824$I find it rude.|
42235|#824$#I can appreciate gentle people.
#822$#Not wishing harm on others is admirable, if foolhardy.|
42236|#822$#Gentle people still desire to protect those they care about.|
42241|What do you think of power?|
42242|What is power to you?|
42243|#823$#Power is my reason for living.
#821$#Power grants you victory, and power prevents needless conflict.|
42244|#821$#Power is a tool, defined by the user. It is a neutral force.|
42245|#822$#Power is a type of philosophy.
#821$#In gaining it, you learn of the world and the people in it.|
42246|#824$#Life is a contest of power. Those with it prevail, those without fail.|
42251|What do you know about the Templars?|
42252|Hey, tell me something about the Templars.|
42253|#822$#They can be admired. It requires great power and skill to be a Templar. 
#823$#I do wish to challenge one someday.|
42254|#822$#The Templars understand the importance of power.
#821$#They are an impressive military force.|
42255|#821$#Becoming a Templar is a difficult task, requiring much work.|
42256|#824$#It has been said that the Templars have a dark past, but it is the present by which all should be judged.|
42261|Tell me about some of the places you've seen.|
42262|Where have you traveled?|
42263|#822$#I have a certain fondness for the Ventos Prairie.
#824$#It is unfortunate I despise the Makar.|
42264|#821$#The Triatio Highlands intrigue me. They are home to skilled hunters.|
42265|#822$#The Demarech Mines... they make me nostalgic.
#823$#I can feel the power of the Cube of Gaia there. I wonder if it is buried in the depths...|
42266|#824$#Candeo Marsh is a terrible place. I avoid it as much as possible.|
42271|What can you tell me about the Auction House?|
42272|Give me some advice regarding the Auction House.|
42273|#823$#It is a useful tool, used to buy and sell items. I know little of it, though.|
42274|#821$#You should learn about the Auction House. Consider it financial training.|
42275|#822$#Navea's Auction House is the largest I have seen.
#821$#Almost too large, I would say.|
42276|#824$#You should learn the market. What prices are fair? Which are competitive?
#822$#Wealth is another form of power - one the world is very quick to recognize.|
42281|How do I make my equipment sparkle?|
42282|Tell me about Fortification.|
42283|#821$#Fortification is critical to growth. Fragments you get from disassembling equipment can be used to fortify weapons and armor.
#823$#Make sure to convert useless gear.|
42284|#822$#Even if Fortification fails, the equipment's potential will still increase slightly.
#821$#When the accumulated potential reaches 100, that item will level.|
42285|#822$#When an item is fortified, its power increases.
#823$#A fully fortified weapon will shine.|
42286|#824$#Equipment Fortification is based on luck, so don't worry if it doesn't go right.|
42291|What do you do when you explore?|
42292|How do you find interesting things?|
42293|#821$#Training.
#822$#The world is your training grounds. You will find interesting things simply by pushing yourself.|
42294|#822$#Listen to what people say. 
#821$#You'll hear interesting things.
#823$#One person's problem is another's opportunity.|
42295|#821$#Everyone is different.
#822$#Learn from them and become stronger for it.|
42296|#821$#The extraordinary is merely the ordinary with training.
#823$#Never stop growing.|
42301|Do you like to eat?|
42302|How much do you usually eat in a day?|
42303|#822$#My spirit is able to absorb energy directly from the ether, allowing me to function forever.|
42304|#823$#Eating is the process by which humans generate energy. Good fuel helps a machine run at its peak, and so it is with humans.|
42305|#822$#Speaking of food, you should eat better.
#824$#A sound mind and sound body are achieved by sound eating.|
42306|#821$#My own body weight remains constant, in spite of energy intake.
#823$#I often hear humans lament that it is not so for them.|
42311|How strong are you, anyway?|
42312|How much can you lift?|
42313|#821$#A subject I enjoy speaking on!
#822$#I once carried a mountain...down a mountain.|
42314|#822$#My strength rivals that of the Cube of Gaia.
#823$#In other words, I am nearly invincible.|
42315|#823$#"Dost thou even lift?", spirits would query, my reply to which was to hoist and throw them into the air.|
42316|#823$#Must you ask? I am the strongest Eidolon. I feel no pain, and my body is impervious to lasting harm.|
42321|Will your body ever rust?|
42322|How do you maintain your armor?|
42323|#822$#Even enchanted metal cannot fully escape the passage of time.
#821$#But unless I was negligent, self-maintenance is simple.|
42324|#821$#I oil and polish myself daily.
#822$#Do not confuse this with pampering. It is ensuring the quality of my body.|
42325|#823$#If I were negligent in my upkeep, I might develop a dignified patina.|
42326|#824$#This armor is the container of my soul. To let myself rust would be unthinkable.|
42331|Have you ever cried?|
42332|What sorts of things make you cry?|
42333|#822$#Tears are for when you lack power.
#823$#There is no shame in it, but it is a sign you must continue to grow.|
42334|#823$#I yield. I have shed a tear after surpassing my limits. There is no shame in joy.|
42335|#821$#Victory can be worth a tear or two of joy.
#822$#It is not my taste, but I can understand.|
42336|#824$#It fills me with sorrow when my opponents are weak.|
42341|Hey, what do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42342|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42343|#822$#Uzuriel is a master warrior. Her form is perfect. Her movements are flawless.
#821$#Her battles are like art.|
42344|#822$#Bahadur once led a ruthless, powerful army.
#822$#The mountains themselves would shake when his troops moved.|
42345|#822$#Tigerius Caesar is arrogant, but skilled.
#823$#Former enemies have sworn themselves to him in exchange for training.|
42346|#824$#Quelkulan? His dark arts and toxins would not avail him against me. Let us not speak of him.|
42351|Has your massive frame ever been a hindrance?|
42352|Is there anything you don't like about being so huge?|
42353|#822$#It is annoying that so many people fear me.
#824$#I am quite kind.|
42354|#821$#Birds mistake me for a tree at times.
#823$#It is not really an annoyance, though.|
42355|#822$#Doorways prove problematic at times.|
42356|#823$#Since I am so big, people trust me to pick up their slack in a fight.|
42361|Do you have hobbies aside from training?|
42362|Anything interest you besides training?|
42363|#821$#Singing is a human pursuit that fascinates me.
#823$#It is my shameful secret, but my voice is magnificent. It would be a waste to not use.|
42364|#822$#I like to help people.
#821$#There is a limitless challenge in reacting to every unique problem someone might have.|
42365|#822$#Problem solving.
#823$#Come, why not try it out with me?|
42366|#824$#Believe it or not, I do rest now and again.|
42371|Why do you hate snakes so much?|
42372|What do you hate about snakes?|
42373|#821$#Serpents are weak. They do not even lift.|
42374|#822$#They are weak and lazy creatures.
#824$#They rely on venom to defeat their foes.|
42375|#823$#What is there to like about them?|
42376|#821$#Who would not hate a miserable tube of meat?
#824$#They are, essentially, lizards too lazy to walk.|
42381|Where do you get your power?|
42382|What gives you energy?|
42383|#822$#A subject I enjoy!
#823$#The power of my body is derived from the power of my spirit. A strong will develops a strong body.|
42384|#821$#This node on my chest is a fragment of the Cube of Gaia. It supplements my own power.
#822$#If need be, I can draw upon it to become even stronger.|
42385|#822$#I am capable of harnessing power from the Cube of Gaia and using it as my own.|
42386|#824$#The Cube of Gaia is key to my strength.|
42391|If you and I were separated...|
42392|What will happen to you if we were to ever part ways?|
42393|#821$#I would continue to train and help others.|
42394|#823$#Even if we were to physically part, I would remain with you in spirit.|
42395|#822$#I won't be surprised when that day comes.
#823$#We will still have our responsibilities to attend to.|
42396|#824$#If I fail, then I expect you to replace me with someone stronger.|
42501|What are your thoughts on family?|
42502|What does family mean to you?|
42503|#822$# No one knows you better than family.
#822$# Not only do they support you, but they are the most important people in your life.|
42504|#823$# I consider anyone that cares about me and anyone I cherish to be family.|
42505|#821$# You should really trust your family.
#822$# Regardless of their faults, they always have your best interests at heart.|
42506|#824$# Family are those who you will never betray, no matter what.|
42511|What kind of weather do you like?|
42512|What kind of weather makes you feel most at ease?|
42513|#821$# I adore those warm, sunny days. Nothing graces the land with such tender warmth like hearty sunshine.
#822$# Such days inspire me to strum a little tune, sing the joys of love and laughter, and relax.|
42514|#822$# The breeze on a brisk autumn day is like a waltz - comforting and invigorating.|
42515|#822$#I feel most content under a clear blue sky.
#823$#The sun blankets the landscape in unflawed, comforting warmth.|
42516|#824$#I dislike the rain. Storm clouds blot out the sky like a cloak over my heart.|
42521|Are you an effective liar?|
42522|How good are you at deception?|
42523|#822$#If you can successfully lie to yourself, then you can successfully lie to anyone.
#824$#However, if you cannot trust yourself, who in this world can you trust?|
42524|#821$#A person's mood gives clues to their heart. Pleasantries always offer plenty of distraction.
#822$#A person that succumbs to your flattery is like putty in your hands.|
42525|#822$#Lying always turns against you in the end. Why would you want to learn more about it?
#821$#Instead, why not be truthful? Sometimes it takes more skill and courage to say what is really on your mind.|
42526|#824$#I told a lie once, to someone dear to me. If only I knew how much that lie would hurt her...|
42531|Do you like to shop?|
42532|Do you like to go shopping with people?|
42533|#821$#I am indifferent about shopping.
#822$#To me, it is a necessity best performed at a leisurely pace.|
42534|#821$#I don't mind shopping with others, but I typically do such a thing by myself.|
42535|#822$#Usually others will not shop with me, not the other way around.
#824$#I radiate too much heat. It makes others around me too uncomfortable.|
42536|#824$# I used to go shopping all the time with someone quite dear to me...|
42541|Have you ever joined any clubs?|
42542|What is your experience in community service?|
42543|#821$#I was once part of an orchestra. Oh, those lively days...
#823$#At that time, we were... modestly famous.|
42544|#822$#My role in the orchestra was playing the harp.
#823$#I'm normally not one to boast, but I do recall my music compelling even small animals to dance...|
42545|#821$#I was lead harp in my orchestra, and was even a part-time conductor. 
#823$#Every time I was chosen to conduct, our performance was a hit.|
42546|#824$#It would bring me great joy to play the harp for an orchestra again someday.|
42551|What do you think is special about the Altar of the Moon?|
42552|What do you know about the Altar of the Moon?|
42553|#821$#The Crescent Gem to which the Altar of the Moon is consecrated has enough power to unravel the seal. 
#822$#The land's history is plagued with battles between tribes vying for that Gem.|
42554|#824$#Perhaps this is just my selfish,
#823$#but I've always liked to imagine that the Altar of the Moon could one day return my sister to me.|
42555|#822$#Every year, Lunarin throws a magical little celebration at the Altar of the Moon.
#821$#Aside from receiving the blessings of ancient warriors departed,
#823$#they share energy with every resident of the village.|
42556|#822$#Perhaps the Cube of Gaia took special care with this place while creating the world.
#821$#It would explain why the Power of Gaia saturates the Altar of the Moon.|
42561|Do you know anything about rare elite monsters?|
42562|What advice do you have about rare elite monsters?|
42563|#822$#Rare elite monsters are stronger than normal monsters, thus tougher to defeat. Defeating one of them requires a bit of skill.|
42564|#821$#Despite how difficult it is to defeat rare elite monsters, there is a benefit in it.
#823$#There is a much greater chance to obtain very rewarding items from them.|
42565|#821$#Garrison members are stationed at every village. They oversee the demise of rare elite monsters. 
#823$#Simply report your kill to one of these garrison members, and you will receive a generous reward.|
42566|#824$#So many monsters roam the lands these days, including rare elite monsters.
#823$#As such, if you see someone struggling with a rare elite, do your best to lend a hand!|
42571|What do you know about point allocation?|
42572|Give me some advice about point allocation.|
42573|#821$#Investing your Attack Points to SPD can effectively shorten casting time with certain skills.|
42574|#823$#There are no restrictions to attack point allocation. Use them where it best suits you!|
42575|#821$#Allocating your Defense Points to HP is an effective way to increase your HP!|
42576|#822$#There are no conditions to resetting your points. Freely play around with your stats to what best suits you!|
42581|Do you know anything about Set Bonuses?|
42582|I would like some info on Set Bonuses.|
42583|#823$#Collect and equip matching set gear. When you have a full set, you unlock special abilities!|
42584|#821$#Gear of the same set will be labeled with the same name.|
42585|#822$#You can find gear of the same set in a general store. Feel free to purchase them at level.|
42586|#824$#Nothing is more bothersome than knowing you are one piece away from gaining a full set bonus!|
42591|Can you give me some advice about dungeons?|
42592|What do you know about dungeons?|
42593|#821$#Daily raiding times are limited, so be sure to come prepared before entering.|
42594|#822$#Keep in mind that monsters in dungeons are much more difficult to defeat than ones out in the world. I wish you luck!|
42595|#823$#There is a chance to obtain very good, rare items from defeating monsters in dungeons. I find this quite enticing.|
42596|#823$#There are few things that bring more joy than surviving a dungeon to its end.|
42601|Have you ever slept in?|
42602|How do you normally wake up in the morning?|
42603|#824$#Lately, I rise as the sun just begins to peek over the horizon. Do you find this unusual?|
42604|#823$#I can proudly say that I've never wasted a day by sleeping in.|
42605|#822$#I tend to rise earlier in the summer and later in the winter.|
42606|#821$#There are times when I actually wish I could sleep a little longer, but I don't think that's possible.
#824$#I can't imagine missing a sunrise, to not start my day with such glory.|
42611|Do you have any regrets?|
42612|What is one thing in your life you wish you could change?|
42613|#822$# Everyone harbors regrets in their hearts. It's how one deals with those regrets that's important.
#821$#I'm certain that you, too, have done something you've regretted.|
42614|#822$#Dwelling over regret is rather pointless; you can't take such actions back.
#821$#Instead, it is best to learn from those mistakes to prevent similar situations from occurring again.|
42615|#824$#Please forgive me, my sister...|
42616|#824$#I'd... rather not discuss this right now...|
42621|What instrument do you play the best?|
42622|What is your favorite instrument?|
42623|#821$#I can play many different instruments, but I am best at the harp.|
42624|#822$#Every time I brush my fingers against those harp strings, surrounding animals stop to listen, transfixed by such beautiful sound.
#821$#Just thinking about it soothes my heart.|
42625|#821$#I excel at the harp, an instrument with its origins in my hometown.
#823$#What is truly astonishing about the harp is that you can use it as both an instrument of music and an instrument of war.|
42626|#824$#I sigh with both heart and soul whenever I hear melancholy sounds from a harp.|
42631|Why do you cover your face?|
42632|Is there a reason why you don't show your face?|
42633|#822$#I have vowed to never show my face until I have fulfilled an oath I've set long ago.
#821$#I will not remove this cowl until my oath is fulfilled.|
42634|#821$#Indeed, there is a reason behind this...|
42635|#824$#My crimson cloak symbolizes the blood oath I took long ago.
#822$#It is a constant reminder of what I must fulfill.|
42636|#824$#I promise you, sister, I will find you...|
42641|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42642|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42643|#822$#I've found Kotonoha to be quite charming, with a kind heart and a tender singing voice.
#821$#I can understand why many are so fond of her.|
42644|#822$#I have heard that Yarnaros can manipulate poisons
#822$#and that his greatest joy is flying.|
42645|#821$#Sigrun gains most of her power from the runes etched on her sword and shield.
#823$#Her fighting prowess is like a raging snowstorm, such chilling efficiency.|
42646|#824$#Though Bel-Chandra's dance is graceful and beautiful, 
#824$#every movement of her body brings forth thunder and destruction. I find it difficult to respect her talent because of that.|
42651|What goals do you have?|
42652|What do you want to achieve in life?|
42653|#821$#I have hurt someone very dear to me.
#824$#I would like a chance to apologize to her and atone for my sins against her.|
42654|#821$#I will find her without a doubt. This is my ultimate goal.|
42655|#822$#I wish with all my heart that I can undo the mistakes I have made.
#824$#I cannot think about or do anything else before I atone for those mistakes.|
42656|#822$#This world is full of people weighed down by remorse and regret.
#823$#By shining sunlight into their hearts, I hope I can guide them from the darkness of despair.|
42661|Is your armor enchanted?|
42662|Why do you always wear that armor?|
42663|#823$#This armor brings forth the the light of healing.|
42664|#821$#This armor is forged from my repentance. It helps me bring warmth to this dark world.|
42665|#822$#This armor holds my sins around me like a heavy shackle.
#821$#Only when I have finally washed away my sins will I be ale to shed this heavy burden.|
42666|#824$#These tainted hands carry too much blood to justify healing anyone with.
#824$#Only through my armor can I mend the hearts and souls of others.|
42671|How hot do you get?|
42672|How hot do your flames get?|
42673|#822$#With maximum power, the heat that generates from me is comparable to the surface of the sun.
#823$#Most enemies incinerate with that much heat.|
42674|#822$#Though my flame can melt stone, I cannot risk hurting someone with it.
#821$#I use such heat only as a last resort.|
42675|#822$#Rather than burn, my flame soothes the soul, casting a light that chases away the darkness in one's heart.
#823$#This is my method of healing.|
42676|#824$#No matter how effective my flame is, it does nothing for personal matters of the heart.|
42681|What do you do at night?|
42682|How do you spend your evenings?|
42683|#822$#My sister rules the hours between sunset and sunrise. She only appears when the stars are out.
#824$#I try to see her every night, but she always eludes me.|
42684|#824$#Nothing reminds me more of my biggest mistake in life than these long, dark nights.|
42685|#821$#I do my best to keep a tranquil peace of mind after sunset, 
#824$#but my thoughts always drift to a certain dark period of my past.|
42686|#822$#I do my best to reduce my body heat at night so as to not disrupt the balance of nature - the cooling of things after sunset.|
42691|If you and I were separated...|
42692|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
42693|#821$#You are an outstanding Envoy of Gaia. As long as you continue to work hard and stay true to yourself, you'll have the power to change the world.
#823$#Should we ever part, I know that you will lead a glorious life.|
42694|#822$#After we part, I will travel the world, playing sweet melodies to those that will listen.
#821$#It is my wish to deliver warmth to people's hearts.|
42695|#821$#If such a time truly arrives, I will play music of utmost honor and respect in your name.|
42696|#822$#Should we part, I will continue to look for my sister.
#824$#I will not cease until I can finally rest my eyes upon her and voice my words of apology.|
42801|What is a brave warrior to you?|
42802|What kind of person makes brave warrior?|
42803|#822$# Do you even need to ask? Just look at me!
#821$# I'm the mightiest Eidolon of them all!|
42804|#821$#A true warrior does not allow fear or harm or death to prevent them from carrying out their duty.
#822$#We fight not for ourselves, but for a greater whole which depends on each doing their part.|
42805|#822$# Are you blind?
#821$# I am bravery incarnate!
#822$#Ha! You should really get your eyes checked out.|
42806|#822$#There is no need for you to discreetly praise me like this.
#821$#I am clever enough to know precisely what you mean. Others... are not.
#822$#If you wish to praise others, it would be better to do so directly.|
42811|Do you like animals?|
42812|What do you think of animals?|
42813|#822$#Animals, you say? They do not tend to cross my mind often.
#822$#They are living beings, as you are - man and animal should assist each other's survival.|
42814|#822$#If I were to select a 'favorite' animal, it might be the mountain ram.
#821$#Upon bare rocks he loses not his footing, and his charge lays low his enemy.|
42815|#822$#There are not many animals I have a special like for, but there are many I hold in disdain, such as rats.
#823$#Scavengers of food, spreaders of disease...
#822$#Have they any noble purpose in this world?|
42816|#822$# I don't mind rabbits, especially when they're roasted. Rabbit fur is also quite warm and comfortable.
#824$# It is a pity that they are so small. I would need to eat several rabbits in one sitting to feel full.|
42821|Are you an effective liar?|
42822|How good are you at deception?|
42823|#822$#Do I look like a liar to you?
#822$#I took to the battlefield in such an era where a warrior's word was his bond, and I live by that principle still.
#824$#Truly, you wound me, imagining me some spinner of falsities!|
42824|#822$#Do I look like the type who has lies to tell?
#823$#You...appear skeptical still, I see.
#822$#Events are remembered by individuals, and it is possible for individuals to have their own truths that sometimes contradict. Such is the way of memory.|
42825|#822$#I sense no ill intent from you, so I will answer you in a civil manner.
#821$#I do not lie.
#822$#Telling untruths profits me nothing. The currencies I value - honor, virtue, temperance - are not honed by a liar's tongue.|
42826|#822$#I am no deceiver, I assure you.
#821$#I may not remember things with perfect clarity, but I do not intentionally omit details.
#822$#If someone corrects me, and they have proof of what they say, I will accept them.|
42831|What would you do if you encountered a very powerful enemy?|
42832|How do you deal with a powerful enemy?|
42833|#822$#I have retreated, but never been defeated.
#821$#The key is to try many types of assault. See what the enemy can deal with - and what they cannot.|
42834|#821$# How dare you compare me to regular people! I'm the strongest Eidolon of them all, for god's sake!
#822$# Compared to me, everyone else is weak!|
42835|#821$#I deal with powerful foes the same way I deal with all foes: the martial skills I have honed over eons.
#822$#Technology may change with the times, but the principles that win fights generally do not.|
42836|#822$#Oh? Are you worried we shall cross paths with an unbeatable foe?
#821$#No enemy shall overcome me.
#822$#You may be at ease in my presence, for the greatest foe is not without, but within.|
42841|What are your weaknesses?|
42842|Do you have any weaknesses?|
42843|#822$#Assuming for a moment I had secret vulnerabilities, what warrior in their right mind would tell of their own weaknesses?
#821$#I have nothing you would think of as a vulnerability.|
42844|#823$#Weakness? I was...perhaps vulnerable once, strong but imperfect.
#821$#This armor is a testament to that, and it offers up no weakness.|
42845|#822$#Does the question burn so deeply within you?
#821$#Some would say my cup is all too full of pride, and that such is my weakness.
#822$#But I assure you, I make no declarations my skills cannot support.|
42846|#822$#Very well, come closer, and I shall tell you of my one weakness.
#821$#My weakness is... ... Yes, just as I said.
#822$#What's that? You didn't hear me? Well, I did say to come closer, didn't I?|
42851|What's special about Vulture's Vale?|
42852|What can you tell me about Vulture's Vale?|
42853|#824$# Vulture's Vale? The name sounds familiar... Hmm, let me think...|
42854|#822$# Vulture's Vale? Apparently it's the site of a huge battle.
#821$# As mightiest of the Eidolons, I'm not gonna miss that party!|
42855|#821$# The scenery in Vulture's Vale is amazing - the magnificent wilderness and waterfalls there are just breathtaking.
#823$# If I had to pick one spot to be a battleground... Vulture's Vale would be my choice!|
42856|#821$# Vulture's Vale is in the northern part of the continent.
#824$# If you want to go there with your current skill level... I'm afraid I'll have to go along to protect you.|
42861|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
42862|What can you tell me about the Aura Kingdom?|
42863|#822$# Hmm? I never thought you'd be interested in that sort of place.
#824$# It's very peaceful and quiet there - to me, it's the definition of "boring"...|
42864|#823$# The Aura Kingdom? I've heard it's full of skilled warriors!
#821$# Still, they're no match for me!|
42865|#824$# The Aura Kingdom... I sure do miss living there...|
42866|#822$# Hmm... I suppose I can tell you about the Aura Kingdom... That is, if you really want to know...
#824$# The Aura Kingdom is a place of beauty and light. I'll never understand why humans are so curious about the Aura Kingdom...|
42871|I'd like to know about the Holy Chest.|
42872|Tell me what you know about the Holy Chest.|
42873|#821$# Think of the Holy Chest as a big container for your gold-quality weapons. 
#823$# And putting a gold-quality weapon with a high enough fortification level in the Holy Chest makes it even more powerful!|
42874|#822$# Hmm? Holy Chest? Ah, you're asking the right person!
#823$# First, try fortifying one of your gold-quality weapons. When it's ready, put it in the Holy Chest and see what happens!|
42875|#822$# But only a few chosen Envoys of Gaia are strong enough to handle the Holy Chest and its enormous power.
#821$# I think you'll handle the Holy Chest just fine, as long as you have me by your side.|
42876|#822$# Holy Chest? I'm fine without that sort of thing.
#821$# But I'm sure it will be a big help to you.|
42881|I'd like to know about Masteries.|
42882|Tell me about Masteries.|
42883|#823$# Masteries? Ha - I'm masterful at everything!
#821$# I'll show you a thing or two sometime.|
42884|#821$# There are a number of Class Masters in Navea.
#822$# If you ever feel like your fighting skills could use a boost, go talk to them.|
42885|#823$# Choose Masteries that will help you develop your skills to their utmost.
#821$# They'll play an even more important role when you start visiting Dungeons.|
42886|#822$# Masteries not only add new effects to your skills, they also boost your stats.
#821$# Collect as many Masteries as you can on your adventures!|
42891|I'd like to know about the Login Reward System.|
42892|What's special about Login Rewards?|
42893|#823$# Login Reward System? Sounds like it's designed just for me!
#824$# The Login Reward System gives you an incentive to meet up with me more often!|
42894|#822$# You'll be rewarded handsomely for logging in daily.
#821$# It's a really easy way to get rewards... Don't say I didn't tell you!|
42895|#822$# Login Rewards? What's that?|
42896|#822$# Well, the Login Reward System has lots of benefits. I'll tell you about it.
#821$# You'll be rewarded handsomely for logging in daily.
#823$# Not only can you get free items from the Item Mall, you may even get extra Dragon Points!|
42901|I hear that you're invincible. Is this true?|
42902|I hear that nothing can harm you. Is this true?|
42903|#821$#Of course it's true. No weapon can hurt me!
#822$#Don't believe me? Then hit me with your best shot!|
42904|#822$#Of course it's true! I'll bet you wish you were as impervious.
#821$#To be invincible, you must first look invincible - and in that I cut a fine figure.
#824$#You, on the other hand... perhaps, if you train hard for the next 100 years, you too can be untouchable...|
42905|#822$#It is impossible for someone to be impeccably handsome, undeniably strong, AND possess a charming character!
#821$#But if anyone WERE to have those traits in equal measure, surely I would be a top contender.|
42906|#822$#I am confused as to why you would ask such a question.
#822$#Surely you've noticed my lack of injuries...
#824$#It breaks my heart that you have failed to notice the splendor of my battles!|
42911|Have you ever been defeated?|
42912|I've heard that you've never been defeated.|
42913|#822$#You are joking, right? I am Abraxas, unconquerable under heaven.
#821$#The being has not been born that can subdue my proud spirit.|
42914|#822$#The rumor of my flawless record is absolutely true!
#821$#Spirits fall before my might, and humans ten times so.|
42915|#823$#Are you actually questioning my ability?
#821$#Though I have contemplated lessons I might learn from defeat, I have not actually been bested in combat.|
42916|#822$#Is the answer not obvioius? Have you not heard the stories?
#821$#I return from battle after battle, bearing nary even a scratch.|
42921|Your armor looks so cool!|
42922|You have amazing armor.|
42923|#821$#Haha, I know!
#822$#How could someone so handsome cover his flawless beauty with armor?
#821$#I could never have borne it, except by commissioning a suit of armor so stylish, even my fellows in the Aura Kingdom were jealous.|
42924|#822$#I see even humans are capable of fine taste!
#821$#This armor was crafted in the aether-forges of the Aura Kingdom.
#822$#Its cost cannot be fathomed - a king's treasury would scarcely buy a finger-plating.|
42925|#822$#This armor is not just for looks, you know.
#821$#It's light and exceedingly durable. It is armor meant to be lived in.|
42926|#822$#Oh? Do you want to look just like me?
#824$#Sadly, I cannot help you - this armor was a custom-fitted gift of great worth.
#822$#Hopefully you will one day find raiment as fitting for yourself.|
42931|What weapons are you best with?|
42932|What are your favorite weapons?|
42933|#822$#A prudent question, but unnecessary.
#821$#All the weapons and devices of man are known to me, and many wholly unknown to man.
#823$#Watch, and learn.|
42934|#822$#I have trained extensively in all manner of weaponry.
#821$#As long as there is war, there will be weapons, and as long as there are weapons, I will master them and turn them against evil.|
42935|#821$#I have knowledge of weapons that are, that have been, and even weapons that have yet to be.|
42936|#822$#I excel at using all weapons.
#821$#However, one's body is the perfect, original weapon, and so it is with my body that I subdue my foes.|
42941|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42942|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42943|#821$#The mysterious messenger Nalani can communicate not only with animals, but with plants.
#822$#I wonder what manner of things plants have to say...|
42944|#822$#Zaahir radiates a heat like the earth's very mantle!
#824$#So intense is it that even I would not venture too near him unbidden.
#822$#I would not be surprised if the sensation of coldness is unknown to him.|
42945|#823$#Between you and me, I suspect that Tsubaki may not be a woman.
#822$#She always looks at me with such disdain, such...disinterest.
#822$#No swoons, no sighs...how else does one explain such strange behavior?|
42946|#824$#I am afraid I cannot give a good answer.
#822$#Gossip is sometimes seen as...less than noble, among the spirits.
#822$#Though if you seek an angel with great knowledge of hidden secrets, I can recommend Uzuriel.|
42951|You have an amazing kick!|
42952|Where did you learn to kick like that?|
42953|#822$#Thank you for noticing!
#821$#I've spent my entire life perfecting my kick - it's as basic a bodily function as breathing now.|
42954|#821$#Of course you would think so! You pursued my aid and secured it, and I am not one to disappoint.|
42955|#822$#I humbly and honorably accept your compliment - flattery though it may be.|
42956|#822$#There is more about me fit to amaze than simply my kicks.
#821$#My intelligence and stunning good looks are a killer pair, if I say so myself.|
42961|Are you able to sit down?|
42962|What do you need to do to sit?|
42963|#824$#Why is it that you persist in knowing only insignificant details about me?
#822$#Just focus on the big picture, like how majestic I look as I strike down mighty foes.|
42964|#822$#That is possibly the most unusual question you've asked me yet.
#821$#When there is reason to sit, I sit. When I wish to stand, I stand.
#822$#Why is this important to you? You're quite the strange one...|
42965|#822$#You must have the impression that my armor restricts some motions.
#821$#It is not so, however, because within the armor my soul has no fleshly form.
#822$#Standing does not make me tired, and I am more prepared for battle that way - thus, I stand.|
42966|#822$#Why fret over such a trivial thing?
#821$#Look at me! Such a lithe form, such a radiant presence! When one can stand tall, they ought to stand and shake the heavens.|
42971|What do you look like under all that armor?|
42972|I wonder what you look like underneath the armor...|
42973|#821$#I'm fairly certain that you wouldn't be able to handle such perfect beauty, so I thoughtfully spare you such emotional turmoil.
#822$#Really, though...before I took up this armor, I was widely considered irresistably handsome.
#824$#I wish I could show you...|
42974|#822$#The closer you look, the less you'll see.
#821$#Where once I clothed myself in beauty, now I wear the raiment of mystery.|
42975|#822$#In a great battle, long ago, I was grievously injured, to the brink of death.
#822$#My body could not be saved, but my eternal soul became the heart of this armor.
#821$#I was glad to live, but sad it came at the cost of my former beauty...|
42976|#822$#I have heard among humans that "familiarity breeds contempt".
#821$# If would be a shame if you were to tire of me because all the mystery was gone, wouldn't it?|
42981|How are you able to float like that?|
42982|What makes you able to fly?|
42983|#821$# Well, it's really nothing. I'm the strongest Eidolon of them all!|
42984|#822$#Oh? Do you wish to fly?
#822$#I was born with this ability, but you...
#824$#Perhaps it would be better if you contented yourself with a good sprint.|
42985|#822$#It is quite splendid, to hover or soar in the sky.
#821$#There's really nothing to it.
#821$#Perhaps one day, your spirit will travel to the Aura Kingdom, and you can fly as well.|
42986|#822$#I shan't bore you with the details.
#821$#But did you expect someone from the Aura Kingdom to be bound to the earth?|
42991|If you and I were separated...|
42992|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
42993|#822$#I would return to the Aura Kingdom, most likely.
#821$#There is never a shortage of evil that must be vanquished.|
42994|#822$#Are you thinking of leaving me? Surely you jest!
#823$#Who else could you spend time with who's as witty, intelligent, or dashing?
#824$#Is this what the cold pang of rejection feels like?|
42995|#824$#You're thinking much too far ahead.
#822$#Life is meant to be lived in the present. Let us continue on and see what new challengies lie in store.|
42996|#822$#You need not worry about my welfare.
#821$#Before I met you, I fought alone, and I suppose I can return to being a solitary soldier.|
43701|What do you think defines a friend?|
43702|What does being a friend mean to you?|
43703|#821$#I cultivate satisfaction within my own sphere, so that the quality of my life does not depend on what others think of me.|
43704|#821$#Friends...?
#822$#Long ago, I had many friends, and my halls were filled with feasting. Now, I have many servants, but few friends.|
43705|#822$#Friends are helpful, but ultimately, you are the only person you can count on.
#821$#And me, of course.|
43706|#821$#A friend? Perhaps one who shares in the joys and pains of the battlefield; someone who understands the fragility of life.
#822$#I suppose you may be considered a friend, if we fight alongside each other.|
43711|How would you handle an encounter with a powerful enemy?|
43712|What would you do against a powerful foe?|
43713|#821$#I would employ all means to exploit their weaknesses, devious or no.
#822$#I've yet to meet someone who didn't have some trait that could be capitalized on.|
43714|#822$#Are you worried?
#821$#You have no reason to be fearful so long as I'm here.|
43715|#821$#A 'powerful' enemy, you say?
#822$#I don't think I've ever met someone that could be considered 'powerful'.|
43716|#821$#A 'powerful' enemy? This is amusing!
#823$#Someone with power comparable to yours is nothing to me.|
43721|If you could make one wish come true, what would it be?|
43722|What is your greatest wish?|
43723|#821$#Wishes don't come true, everyone knows this.
#823$#Such a pointless question.|
43724|#822$#I've never seen the point in making wishes.
#821$#If it can happen naturally, I can do it.
#822$#If I can't do it, no one else can either.|
43725|#821$#The death of my best friend was one of the saddest moments of my life. If I could make any wish, I'd want my friend back.
#822$#I've done so many things, accomplished so much, but I failed to protect my one and only friend.
#821$#So, above all else, I'd wish for my best friend back.|
43726|#821$#Why bother asking such an unrealistic question? Wishes don't come true like that.|
43731|How do you handle mistakes?|
43732|What would you do if you've done something wrong?|
43733|#821$#You are joking, right?
#822$#I don't make mistakes.|
43734|#821$# Everything I do is intended.
#822$#If I do anything wrong, it's your fault. I simply don't make mistakes.|
43735|#822$#Are you trying to cover up your own mistakes by pinning them on me?
#821$#Normally, I punish those who make mistakes.
#822$#All I expect from you, though, is an apology.|
43736|#822$#Why do you dare question my decisions?
#821$#It is impossible for me to make mistakes!|
43741|What are your weaknesses?|
43742|What problems do you have?|
43743|#821$#Weaknesses, you say? I'm essentially perfect.
#822$# I don't have any weakness that I can think of.|
43744|#822$#Weaknesses, is it?
#821$#If you find one, let me know, so I can eliminate it straightaway.|
43745|#821$#Problems are for demons less dashing than I.|
43746|#821$#Weaknesses, you say?
#823$#I suppose not having any weaknesses could be considered an issue...|
43751|What's it like in Navea?|
43752|What do you think of Navea?|
43753|#821$#Navea is to be praised for its cultural diversity.
#822$#With such a blend, you'll find things you won't see anywhere else.
#823$#You'll  learn a lot just by conversing with the residents there.|
43754|#821$#Navea is a grand city indeed.
#823$#However, it pales in comparison to where I hail from!|
43755|#821$#Discussing Navea makes me think of the Templars.
#822$#I could lay those shiny suits out with a single punch.
#823$#The fracas could hardly be called a fight!|
43756|#821$#Many masters of combat make their home in Navea.
#822$#You can find them in the west of the city, ready to take on worthy clients.
#823$#Though, between you and me, human Mastery seems but a crude reflection of the mastery spirits possess.|
43761|Let's talk about the different races on Terra.|
43762|What do you know about the different races?|
43763|#821$#I don't care much for Giants and Trolls.
#822$#All brawn, no brain - where's the fun in an opponent like that?|
43764|#821$#The wolfmen are quite insidious.
#822$#What they set themselves to do, they do at any cost. Some might call such behavior...unhinged.|
43765|#821$#I consider the Sarpa a primitive and savage race.
#822$#However, there are some intelligent ones among them.
#821$#They have a delicious sort of feral cleverness - I'm eager to see more of them in the flesh.|
43766|#821$#Dwarves have a very unique sense of style.
#822$#They always wear clothing that covers their faces.
#821$#What have they to hide, it makes me wonder.|
43771|How do you use the Eidolon interface?|
43772|Tell me something about the Eidolon Interface.|
43773|#821$#In the Eidolon interface, you can learn ability information about each Eidolon 
#822$#as well as change the Eidolon's gear or name.
#823$#You better not give me some obscene name!|
43774|#821$#You can read a brief introduction about each Eidolon in the interface.
#823$#I hope you have memorized my own introduction by heart!|
43775|#821$#If you have certain EXP crystals,
#822$#you can feed them to your Eidolon in the interface to enhance their ability.
#821$#Don't waste your EXP crystals on weaker Eidolons! They are not worthy of such generosity.|
43776|#821$#You can rearrange the members of your Eidolon team in the interface.
#822$#You can't change your team during battles, so select your members carefully.|
43781|How can I improve in dungeons?|
43782|How should I prepare for a raid?|
43783|#821$#The most important thing to do is bring plenty of HP potions.
#822$#If you find yourself in a bind with no other means of being healed, that could prevent you from dying!|
43784|#821$#This is a simple answer:
#822$#You must have as much courage as me.|
43785|#821$#Raiding, correct? Have you fortified your equipment?
#822$#That could make all the difference in an epic battle.|
43786|#821$#What kind of question is this? I am more than sufficient to raid with you.
#822$#No dungeon is too daunting, no enemy too tough for me.
#823$#Just supply me with plenty of EXP crystals and I'll get the job done.|
43791|How do you get rare gear?|
43792|Where can I get rare gear?|
43793|#821$#I'm glad you chose me to ask this question to.
#822$#Defeating any rare elite monster will give you a chance to obtain rare gear.|
43794|#821$#I've heard that you can find high-quality gear at the armor shops.
#822$#No, I won't buy any for you.|
43795|#821$#The best way to get great gear is to raid with other players.
#823$#When you get the gear you need, don't forget to thank me for the advice!|
43796|#821$#I'll be more than happy to offer advice.
#822$#Pay attention when you kill monsters; you might see a Valuable Treasure Chest.
#822$#The items in a Valuable Treasure Chest are all superior quality.|
43801|Has anyone ever questioned your character?|
43802|Has anyone ever complained about you?|
43803|#821$#Those people are morons.
#822$#Mortals can never hope to understand me.|
43804|#821$#Are you jealous, perhaps?
#822$#I will forgive you for that. I don't expect anyone to be like me.|
43805|#821$#This isn't backhanded criticism, is it?
#822$#It is a good thing I am so open-minded. I will take this into consideration.|
43806|#821$#Those are just short-sighted views from ignorant people. I couldn't be bothered with it all.|
43811|I've heard that you're the richest being in the world!|
43812|I've heard that the world's wealth belongs to you.|
43813|#821$#You are quite intuitive! I do, indeed, hold all the world's wealth.
#821$#How much that is, exactly, I'd... have to count...|
43814|#821$#Any treasure truly belongs to me.|
43815|#821$#And your point is...? My wealth cannot be coveted.|
43816|#821$#I don't care about other forms of wealth, but the world's treasures are mine.|
43821|Can you fly?|
43822|Are you able to fly?|
43823|#821$#Of course I can fly! There's nothing I can't do.|
43824|#821$#Flying is easy for me.|
43825|#821$#You dare question my abilities?
#821$# It's just flying; I don't understand what the big deal is.|
43826|#821$#There's nothing to flying; why are we even talking about something so trivial?|
43831|How did you get your armor?|
43832|Your armor looks really cool! How did you get it?|
43833|#821$#My armor is my greatest treasure.
#821$#It doesn't matter where it came from.|
43834|#821$#I have so much treasure that I don't even remember where I got this armor from.|
43835|#822$#Oh? You want something like this?
#821$#It's a pity that I don't share my wealth.
#823$#Though, if I do manage to find a second set of armor like this, I could be persuaded to give it to you.|
43836|#821$#Mortals are unfit to use my treasure.|
43841|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
43842|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
43843|#821$#Talking about the lesser beings is beneath me.|
43844|#821$#The flame that Aelius uses is rather unique because it heals mortals instead of harms them.
#821$#He's so flaky, though. I don't like him much.|
43845|#821$#I recently learned something about Vayu.
#821$# Supposedly, Vayu is the oldest of the Eidolons, over 10,000 years old! I don't know how much merit there is to that rumor.|
43846|#821$#Why even bother with such trivial gossip?
#821$#I'm sure I'm more than interesting enough on my own.|
43851|What made you become the Duke of Darkness?|
43852|How did you become the Duke of Darkness?|
43853|#821$#I was born into that position. I have no other explanation for it.|
43854|#821$#Why even bother asking?
#821$#The answer should be simple. There is no one else more suitable for the title.|
43855|#821$#There is no point in asking.
#821$#That position was made for me.|
43856|#821$#Only those at their prime, powerful above all else, can rule.
#821$#How else would I have become Duke?|
43861|Do you have any friends?|
43862|Is there anybody who wants to be your friend?|
43863|#821$#I used to have a good friend. We ruled Pandemonium together.
#821$#However, I somehow got him into serious trouble...|
43864|#821$#Hah, friends?
#821$#Only one person qualifies to be a friend of mine!|
43865|#821$#Ignorant fools can never understand how to be friends with me.|
43866|#821$#I've only ever had one friend in my life.
#821$#I can't be bothered with anyone else.|
43871|Have you ever experienced failure?|
43872|Have you ever been defeated?|
43873|#821$#I sincerely hope you are not looking down on me.
#821$#How could I ever be defeated?|
43874|#821$#What is this 'failure' you speak of?|
43875|#821$#I've never failed a match, but I have come to a tie with someone once.
#821$#That person became my only friend.|
43876|#821$#What sort of being do you take me for?
#821$#I've never failed in the past, nor will I fail in the future!|
43881|How do you govern Pandemonium?|
43882|What are your methods of rule?|
43883|#821$# This answer should be simple. I make all the decisions, of course.|
43884|#821$#The answer to this question should be obvious.
#821$#I give out orders, those under me follow them. Simple as that.|
43885|#821$# I am the only ruler. No one questions my orders.|
43886|#821$#Ruling Pandemonium is actually quite easy to do.
#821$#In fact, it can be rather boring at times. I'd rather be in a fierce battle with a worthy opponent!|
43891|If you and I were separated...|
43892|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
43893|#821$#To keep myself occupied, I'd simply go in search for the strongest opponent and defeat them.|
43894|#821$# Don't worry about me. I have a kingdom to return to.|
43895|#821$#You... you'd actually consider leaving me!
#821$#How dare you! I forbid it!
#821$#Who put you up to this idea? I'll chew that person up and spit them out!|
43896|#821$#What would you do without me at your side?
#821$#Perhaps you should worry more about what you would do rather than what I would do.|
44001|What would you do if you encountered a powerful enemy?|
44002|How do you handle a strong opponent?|
44003|#822$# I handle them excellently, of course.
#821$# I'm the Champion of the Slain, Sigrun!
|
44004|#822$# Powerful enemies? Hmm...
#821$# If you have the opportunity to wear them down at range, take it.|
44005|#822$# To me, fighting is like breathing. I don't think about how I do it, I just do!|
44006|#821$# I do not consider an enemy's power, just its weakness.
#823$# Concentrate on your enemy's weaknesses, and you will be victorious.|
44011|What do you think of fighting?|
44012|What do you normally fight for?|
44013|#822$# There are many forms of battle, not just on a battlefield!
#821$# A good fight can be found anywhere - on the field or in your heart.|
44014|#823$# I am the Champion of the Slain! I was born to fight.
#822$# I fight to test my heart and my will against all opposition.|
44015|#821$# So long as you take joy in your power and the proving of it, you will never fight an unworthy battle.|
44016|#822$# Pft! What a boring question! 
#821$# Warriors fight, they die... And then they are mine.|
44021|What kind of person do you like?|
44022|What sort of guy would you date?|
44023|#821$# Only the bravest warrior is deserving of the hand of Sigrun, Champion of the Slain!|
44024|#821$# Ugh! Why are we talking about this?
#822$# Wait... you aren't into me, are you?! 
#821$# That's not the kind of relationship we have!|
44025|#822$# Do I look like some trembling maiden to you? 
#821$# I admire strength in battle, defiance in adversity.
#821$# Only one who is truly powerful will attract my attention.|
44026|#821$# This question is strange. What are you really asking?|
44031|What kind of person would be your friend?|
44032|What does friendship mean to you?|
44033|#821$# My only friends are those I trust to have my back in a fight!|
44034|#821$# I have had human friends, but as time passed, each of them died.
#824$# There's just too big of a difference between Humans and Eidolons...|
44035|#821$# A friend is someone who is willing to sacrifice everything for you, even their life!|
44036|#822$# Why do you ask? Don't you have friends?
#821$# Don't look at me like that! You're the one looking for advice. 
#822$# Don't worry, if you don't have other friends, you'll always have me!|
44041|What do you do when you're in a bad mood?|
44042|How do you overcome a bad mood?|
44043|#822$# With battle, of course... Friends will do, if there are no enemies handy! 
#821$# Hahaha, I was just kidding! 
#822$# Hey, why are you suddenly way over there?|
44044|#821$# Why? Are you in a bad mood?
#822$# Tell me what's bothering you. I'll stab it, and things will be better.
#821$# What? Why are you looking at me like that?|
44045|#823$# With glorious combat!
#821$# Bleeding and sweating away your frustrations is the best remedy.|
44046|#821$# What does a mood matter? You do what you have to, when you have to.|
44051|Do you know of any places of interest in Helonia Coast?|
44052|Do you know anything interesting about Helonia Coast?|
44053|#821$# Helonia is a bustling town, with strong commercial activities.
#824$# Despite the town's economic strength, the people are too weak to protect themselves!|
44054|#821$# Helonia Coast often has pirate problems.
#822$# Pirates aren't much to fight, but better than nothing.|
44055|#821$# Silverash Shores got its name from its shimmering white sand. 
#822$# No, the shoreline is not actually covered in ash!|
44056|#821$# I'm sure you've noticed all the different windmills east of Helonia, right?
#822$# I bet you've never counted how many there are!|
44061|What do you think about the Dwarves?|
44062|What do you know about the Dwarves?|
44063|#823$# Dwarves are a perfect example of why to not judge a book by its cover!
#822$# They may be short and funny-looking, but their weapons are second to none!|
44064|#821$# Dwarves are skilled craftsmen. They make the most sophisticated machinery I've ever seen.
#822$# You should see their fighting robots in action!|
44065|#822$# There is a Dwarf tribe at the Cactakara Forest. Visit them if you get the chance.|
44066|#824$# Some people can't tell the difference between Dwarves and Gnomes. In reality, they are like night and day.|
44071|What are the benefits of joining a guild?|
44072|Tell me something about guilds.|
44073|#821$# When you reach level 10, you can create a guild. 
#822$# After all, even the strongest hero needs comrades to back them up!|
44074|#821$# After you meet certain requirements, you can open a shared space, designed exclusively for the guild. 
#822$# You and your guildmates should definitely strive for this!|
44075|#821$# Guild members can be a source of support during your adventures.
#823$# It reminds me of glorious days of battle with my comrades! Eat together, sleep together, fight together!|
44076|#822$# To upgrade the guild's level, just gather Guild Funds by completing certain quests. 
#821$# When you have accumulated sufficient Guild Funds, the Guild's level will automatically upgrade. Simple!|
44081|I wanna know the secrets of Sword and Shield.|
44082|Please teach me skills for wielding a Sword and Shield.|
44083|#821$# You've come to the right person! I'm the Champion of the Slain, proficient with Sword and Shield! 
#822$# As long as you train hard, and follow my instructions, I guarantee that you will make progress.|
44084|#821$# The essence of using Sword and Shield is to switch between offensive and defensive stances swiftly. 
#822$# Try to use the shield in your hands to make all kinds of daring moves!|
44085|#821$# The brave warriors wielding Sword and Shield have a strong ability to control the flow of battle. 
#822$# They can use their shields to protect partners while using the sword to attack enemies.  
#823$# People using Sword and Shield are the most suitable to fight on the front line!|
44086|#821$# As well as attack and defense, the Sword and Shield combo can also impose special statuses on enemies. 
#822$# After certain masteries have been learned, the Sword and Shield combo can even stun all enemies within a certain range.|
44091|Do you know the use of Elemental Symbols?|
44092|Please inform me about Elemental Symbols.|
44093|#821$# Elemental Symbols carry eight different kinds of pure Elemental Energy from the Cube of Gaia. They are very rare. 
#822$# But if you let me connect to Gaia, then getting those Symbols is not impossible.|
44094|#821$# The Elemental Energy in the Symbols can resonate with an Eidolon's own power. 
#822$# So if you give the Symbols to an Eidolon, the Eidolon's strength can be increased.|
44095|#821$# Humph! I'm the Champion of the Slain, Sigrun! 
#823$# Even without the strength of Symbols, I will still be invincible!|
44096|#821$# All Eidolons will need certain kinds of Elemental Symbols for their evolution. 
#822$# If you ever get those Symbols, do not throw them away.|
44101|You are always wearing armor. Don't you feel feel encumbered?|
44102|Your armor looks very heavy!|
44103|#822$# Who do you think I am? 
#821$# I'm Sigrun, Champion of the Slain!
#822$# My armor is no heavier than my skin.|
44104|#821$# This armor is a gift of Gaia! 
#822$# Under no circumstances would I take this armor off!|
44105|#822$# Humph! I'm the Champion of the Slain! 
#824$# Through long training, this armor and I have become one.|
44106|#822$# Maybe it would seem heavy to you, but not me. 
#821$# I'm an immortal Eidolon! Such limits mean nothing to me.|
44111|What are the qualities of a warrior, to your mind?|
44112|What kind of person can be called a warrior?|
44113|#821$# Someone who never backs down, who is not afraid of any difficulties, and shows courage at all times!|
44114|#822$# Why? You want to be known as a warrior?
#821$# As long as you follow me and fight by my side, I'm sure you will become the bravest warrior!|
44115|#821$# Warrior?... Hmm... 
#821$# Well, I have been watching battles since the beginning.
#822$# I know a warrior when I see one!|
44116|#822$# Well, you are in luck! 
#821$# What's a warrior like? Just look at me!|
44121|What do Eidolons do in daily life?|
44122|What do Eidolons usually do?|
44123|#821$# We are beings of spirit. 
#822$# It's hard to describe our lives in terms of beings of flesh...|
44124|#821$# Do? It seems that I don't do anything worth mentioning. 
#822$# All I can recall is a vision of endless battlefields...|
44125|#822$# I watch over battles, and guide slain warriors into the land of the dead.|
44126|#822$# Well... I don't know about the others. 
#821$# As for me... I just keep training, and keep an ear out for new wars!|
44131|Have you always had such long hair?|
44132|Does your hair get in your eyes in battle?|
44133|#821$# I've kept my hair this long for a while, now.
#822$# My helmet keeps it out of the way.|
44134|#821$# Actually, I used to wear my hair very short. I felt like I needed a change.
#824$# Being a spirit, it can be any length I imagine it to be.|
44135|#821$# Is that what's really important to you? It's just hair.
#822$# As long as my helmet keeps it out of the way in a fight, what does it matter?|
44136|#822$# What's wrong with long hair?
#821$# I keep it out of the way, so I don't have to worry about it getting in my face.
#821$# Not to mention, my hair is so beautiful!|
44141|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
44142|Tell me some interesting gossip about the Eidolons.|
44143|#822$# Humph! Yarnaros is a womanizer! 
#821$# But... The speed and agility he shows in battle are worth watching.|
44144|#822$# Aelius's flame is amazing! 
#821$# It's flame, yet it can heal wounds. Isn't that strange?|
44145|#821$# Bel-Chandra's dance of destruction is the most beautiful dance I've ever seen! 
#822$ What's more important is how deadly it is!|
44146|#822$# Kotonoha looks weak, but her strength can never be underestimated. 
#821$# Her unique sorcery can absorb enemies' lives, which is truly scary!|
44151|I heard that you see things with your heart?|
44152|How did you learn to see things with your heart?|
44153|#822$# Not everybody can learn that. It requires purity and strength!|
44154|#822$# Do you want to learn to see things with your heart? 
#824$# The heart sees true, and truth isn't always pretty. Are you sure?|
44155|#822$# How did I learn to see things with my heart? 
#824$# It's different for Eidolons. We are our hearts, more than humans are.|
44156|#822$# If you wanna learn to see things with your heart, first you need to get that rib cage out of the way! 
#821$# Don't worry, I'm just messing with you!|
44161|Is it true that Eidolons can live forever?|
44162|How long can Eidolons live?|
44163|#822$# I don't know. Forever isn't over yet. 
#821$# Once it does, I'll let you know if we live forever.|
44164|#822$# I don't know whether Eidolons really have eternal lives. 
#821$# But even if we fall in battle, we will return.|
44165|#821$# Well... I don't know exactly how long Eidolons live. 
#822$# But I've lived through thousands of battles, so that must mean something.|
44166|#822$# Who wants to live forever? 
#821$# Who dares to love forever?|
44171|I heard that you kiss your chosen warriors?|
44172|Can the chosen warriors get your kiss?|
44173|#821$# I kiss the chosen warriors and lead them into the Aura Kingdom myself!|
44174|#821$# That's right! Do you also want my kiss? 
#822$# You only have die once. I'm sure it's worth it!|
44175|#822$# It's true, my kiss can wake the dead. 
#821$# But first, you have to die...|
44176|#822$# That's correct! But you forgot to mention the most important point. 
#821$# I'll only kiss those warriors who die heroically on the battlefield.|
44181|How good of a cook are you?|
44182|Do you know how to cook?|
44183|#822$# I'm the Champion of the Slain, Sigrun! 
#821$# Cooking is not an important skill to me!|
44184|#822$# Have you ever seen any Eidolon cooking for themselves?|
44185|#822$# What about you? Just look at how skinny you are.
#821$# I bet you can't cook at all!|
44186|#822$# Cooking skill? Don't think of me as some mortal servant! 
#821$# I protect the slain as they go into their afterlives! Cooking doesn't come up often.|
44191|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
44192|What's your plan after we split up?|
44193|#822$# You mean after we separate? 
#821$# Why think beyond the next battle? You may not live past it.
#822$# What matters is to live in the present!|
44194|#822$# I never expected that you would ask me such a question... 
#824$# Have you eaten something bad? Are you sick?|
44195|#822$# What are you asking me this for? Do you wish to be rid of me? 
#821$# Death is the easiest way to separate yourself from me!|
44196|#822$# Why would you think to ask me such a question!? Even if we part ways today... 
#823$# , I'm sure I'll see you, one last time... On your final battlefield.|
44301|What type of person are you into?|
44302|What type of person are you attracted to?|
44303|#824$# Sorry... I've been focusing on other things.|
44304|#824$# I don't know. All are beautiful... But I don't think that's what you meant.|
44305|#821$# Actually, there was someone. But that was a long time ago...|
44306|#821$# I've haven't thought about that kind of thing in a long time...|
44311|What is a friend, as far as you are concerned?|
44312|How do you define friendship, in your heart?|
44313|#821$# Friends are there for each other, In good times and bad. 
#821$# Friends are loyal to each other, and to remain true.|
44314|#821$# Are you telling me that you don't have any friends? 
#822$# Don't be upset. I'll be your friend.|
44315|#822$# The only friend I want to spend my whole life with is Tsubaki...|
44316|#821$# I don't worry about other people's opinions. I know a friend when I see one.|
44321|What do you think it is to be gentle?|
44322|What seems gentle to you?|
44323|#821$# You chose me, and that was gentle.|
44324|#822$# Gentle? I think Tsubaki is gentle...|
44325|#821$# As far as I'm concerned, Tsubaki is a gentle person. 
#822$# I'm lucky to have met you.|
44326|#821$# I don't know what gentle is... Would you like to help me with that?|
44331|If you could have one wish granted, what would it be?|
44332|What's your dearest wish?|
44333|#821$# My wish? That my friends and I can be there for each other our whole lives.|
44334|#821$# I wish that you get your wish.|
44335|#822$# Wish... My wish? 
#821$# I'll tell you the details when the time is right...|
44336|#822$# Wish... What about yours? Do you have a wish you want to come true?|
44341|Tell me about the dream you had, that stays with you the most.|
44342|What is your most memorable dream?|
44343|#821$# In the dream, I'm on a prairie, in the sunset, the beautiful smile on Tsubaki's face. Oh god, her smile was so beautiful...|
44344|#821$# But a dream... Is just an illusion. 
#822$# I think the present is what matters.|
44345|#822$# Indeed to dream is nice, but a dream is out of reach. 
#821$# So make sure you are not obsessed with dreams and ignore reality.|
44346|#821$# I was walking on a long path, and Tsubaki was walking ahead of me. 
#824$# However, no matter how hard I tried to catch up with her, the distance between Tsubaki and I became greater and greater... 
#822$# Luckily... Luckily it was just a dream.|
44351|What's special about Cactakara Forest?|
44352|Could you tell me something about Cactakara Forest?|
44353|#823$#Cactakara Forest? The forest is beautiful. 
#821$#A river formed by two waterfalls of different sizes flows through the forest.  
#822$# It's a magical place.|
44354|#822$# In the Cactakara Forest there is a small tribe of dwarves. 
#823$# Ah, that is, the tribe is small. Not the dwarves.
#823$# Well, not any smaller than normal dwarves.|
44355|#821$# A group of Centaurs is living in the ruins in Cactakara Forest. 
#822$# They don't much like outsiders.|
44356|#821$# Cactakara Forest is a quiet place, very restful. 
#822$# It's said that an Eidolon who likes to meditate shows up there on occasion.|
44361|What are those secret altars that appear in odd places?|
44362|I wanna know about the Eidolon Altars.|
44363|#821$# The Eidolon Altars are dimensional portals. They're broken now, but if people work together, they can be restored. 
#822$# When a portal is opened, Eidolons will cross over into Terra.|
44364|#822$# The Eidolon Energy that is used to restore an Eidolon Altar is difficult to collect. 
#823$# As long as everyone works together, sufficient quantities can be collected.|
44365|#822$# All that we need to do is offer Eidolon Energy to the broken altar, and, gradually, it will be restored.|
44366|#821$# The altars have the power to send telepathic messages to Eidolons. 
#822$# Keep one thing in mind. Those Eidolons will probably be unhappy to be summoned. 
#823$# After all, no one likes to be disturbed when they're sleeping.|
44371|Please tell me about Eidolon Skills.|
44372|What do you use Eidolon Skills for?|
44373|#821$# With the skill Taunting Eidolon, the Eidolon taunts the enemy, drawing the enemy's attacks.|
44374|#821$# The power of the Ultimate Strikes you and your Eidolon can work together is astonishing. 
#822$# Don't wait, use the Ultimate Strike immediately!|
44375|#821$# Each of us has different origins and strengths, so the skills we have are also different. 
#822$# Carefully picking an Eidolon who complements your own strengths can make your adventure easier.|
44376|#822$# Eidolons can do more than fight. 
#821$# Some can even serve as their Envoy's mount!|
44381|Please tell me something about Party Search.|
44382|I want information about the Party Search.|
44383|#821$# Party Search allows you to recruit party members quickly, to get into a dungeon faster.|
44384|#823$# Using the Party Search System greatly reduces the amount of running around involved in recruiting adventurers. It's very convenient!|
44385|#824$# After forming a party, you must try to get along with the others. They're protecting your back, treat them with respect.|
44386|#822$# When you need to enter a dungeon in Multiplayer Mode, you can look for party members with the Party Search System.|
44391|What is the Envoy's Path?|
44392|How should I choose my way on the Envoy's Path?|
44393|#821$# You will get one Envoy's Path Point every three levels. You must spend it wisely.|
44394|#824$# Don't lose heart if you encounter difficulties when you attack a dungeon; try reallocating your Envoy's Path Points.|
44395|#822$# You can even get new Combination Skills, based on which paths you choose.|
44396|#823$# Choosing different options on your Envoy's Path will lead to different Skill Points.|
44401|Your wings look nice.|
44402|Your wings are so beautiful.|
44403|#822$# Thank you for your compliment. I'm so glad.|
44404|#821$# Tsubaki also likes my wings very much...|
44405|#821$# The Cube of Gaia gave me my beautiful wings. I'm glad you like them.|
44406|#822$# What Tsubaki said is true! Humans do like wings.|
44411|You are very fond of lotus, aren't you?|
44412|You have a preference for the lotus, don't you?|
44413|#822$# The lotus is elegant and gorgeous. I do like them very much.|
44414|#821$# Actually, I have no preference for myself. It's just that Tsubaki likes lotus very much...|
44415|#822$# I enjoy all things that grow from the earth. I like them all.|
44416|#821$# I do like the lotus very much. What about you? Do you also like lotus as much as I do?|
44421|Will your hands fall?|
44422|Have your hands ever fallen?|
44423|#821$# You don't have to worry.|
44424|#821$# My hands will stay on my body until the moment I die.|
44425|#822$# Hee hee... It reminds me that the first time Tsubaki met me, she asked me the exact same question.|
44426|#824$# Where did you get that idea? Have your hands ever fallen off?|
44431|You and Tsubaki know each other very well, don't you?|
44432|You and Tsubaki are very close, aren't you?|
44433|#821$# Tsubaki... Is my first and best friend.|
44434|#821$# Tsubaki... Is my closest friend. 
#822$# I hope our friendship will last 'till the end of our lives...|
44435|#821$# I was once very quiet, so I didn't have too many friends. Tsubaki was my only friend. 
#822$# The fact that I can talk to you like this now? I've got her to thank for that.|
44436|#821$# It might surprise you to know we're very close. I would do anything for Tsubaki.|
44441|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
44442|Tell me something interesting about the Eidolons.|
44443|#824$# I never dig into matters that are none of my business. 
#821$# Of course...most matters are my business.|
44444|#821$# Abraxas is as mighty a warrior as I've ever seen.
#822$# I've heard he's from the Aura Kingdom, but wherever he comes from, he is impressive, yes?|
44445|#821$# Zaahir's whole body radiates an intense heat. Normal people can't even approach him.
#821$# I wonder how he spends time with his Envoy?|
44446|#821$# Tsubaki is an agile ninja, full of acrobatic maneuvers.
#822$# We've been great friends for a long time.|
44451|Can you sit down?|
44452|You are unable to sit down, aren't you?|
44453|#821$# Sit down? I don't need to sit.|
44454|#821$# The moment I fall from the sky is the moment I die.|
44455|#824$# I don't need to care about such trivial matters.|
44456|#821$# You don't have to worry. I have my own way to rest.|
44461|What are the Holy Books?|
44462|Could you tell me about the Holy Books?|
44463|#821$# The Holy Books contain much wisdom - a greater sum than all the libraries of this world.|
44464|#821$# The Holy Books enable me to communicate with all kinds of creatures, and guide their souls to the right path.|
44465|#822$# The Holy Books are the books of wisdom. You can obtain great knowledge from them.|
44466|#822$# I can't explain them to you in detail. The only way to know is to read them yourself.|
44471|You have very unusual skin color. Were you born like this?|
44472|You have very unique skin color. Did you make it that way on purpose?|
44473|#821$# I am as I was formed - no more, no less.|
44474|#822$# The natural look is always best when it comes to appearance. 
#821$# There is no need for me to change.|
44475|#822$# Thank you for your compliment.|
44476|#821$# You're not bad looking, yourself.|
44481|What's the blue ornament on your abdomen?|
44482|What's that on your belly?|
44483|#821$# One day, you'll know.|
44484|#822$# It was given to me by the Cube of Gaia, and I will keep it with me until the day I die.|
44485|#824$# Well... I can't really talk about it. One day you will find the answer yourself.|
44486|#821$# It was a gift from the mother of Eidolons, the Cube of Gaia. 
#821$# All Eidolons born of the Cube of Gaia have this.|
44491|Have you thought about your life after we separate?|
44492|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
44493|#821$# You don't have to worry. I have places to go.|
44494|#821$# I have much to do in this world.|
44495|#821$# Do you want me to go? 
#824$# I think there is much more we have to do together...|
44496|#821$# Our separation now prepares us for our reunion later. 
#822$# You and I will surely meet again.|
44601|What kind of flowers do you appreciate the most?|
44602|What kind of flowers do you like the most?|
44603|#823$# Hee hee. Of course, my favorite is the lily, which symbolizes purity.|
44604|#821$# The fragrant and elegant lily is the most suitable symbol of divine purity. 
#822$# I hope to plant a few, as I travel this world with you.|
44605|#821$# Every flower has its own beauty, as every person has his or her own strength. 
#822$# But my favorite is the lily, for it brings me great calm.|
44606|#821$# The lily is my favorite flower. What about yours?|
44611|Do you know how to cook?|
44612|How are your cooking skills?|
44613|#823$# Actually, I'm pretty confident about my cooking, especially when it comes to desserts. 
#821$# I will make some for you next time, so you can try them.|
44614|#821$# Cooking is one of my hobbies.|
44615|#822$# Though I know how to make all kinds of  food, I'm best at making dessert.|
44616|#821$# Wow, how did you know that I like cooking? 
#823$# Just how much attention are you paying to me?|
44621|What do you think death is?|
44622|What is death to you?|
44623|#822$# Death is one part of the process of reincarnation. It's only a short section of the cycle of life. 
#821$# After the soul is separated from the body, the next chapter of life begins.|
44624|#821$# Death is not the end, only a new beginning.|
44625|#821$# Sometimes death is not a state, but rather a process. 
#824$# Purifying the soul through death. Yes, that was once my duty...|
44626|#822$# To humans in Terra, there are so many unsolvable mysteries about death. That's not the case in other worlds. 
#821$# In other worlds, the concept of death doesn't even exist.|
44631|What's your favorite color?|
44632|What color best symbolizes you?|
44633|#821$# Just look at the clothes I'm wearing. My favorite color is white. What about yours?|
44634|#822$# Pure white is my symbol.|
44635|#823$# Of course my favorite color is white. Watching blooming lilies calms me down.|
44636|#822$# I think of my work in this world as scraping dirt from a white stone. 
#824$# It's a process of removing the impurities and revealing the world's light...|
44641|What do you think peace is?|
44642|What does peace mean to you?|
44643|#821$# Peace is being able to drink and talk with the person you love, with no fear. 
#822$# The faces and hearts of both filled with peace and harmony.|
44644|#822$# Peace is the world filled with laughter and warmth.|
44645|#823$# Each and every battle you and I have fought, we fought to protect peace in the world.|
44646|#822$# Peace was once what I tried my best to protect, but I lost my way... 
#824$# Peace! Peace! Numerous sins have been committed in the name of peace!|
44651|What's special about Cactakara Forest?|
44652|Could you tell me something about Cactakara Forest?|
44653|#823$#Cactakara Forest? The forest is beautiful. 
#821$#A river formed by two waterfalls of different sizes flows through the forest.  
#822$# It's a magical place.|
44654|#822$# In the Cactakara Forest there is a small tribe of dwarves. 
#823$# Ah, that is, the tribe is small. Not the dwarves.
#823$# Well, not any smaller than normal dwarves.|
44655|#821$# A group of Centaurs is living in the ruins in Cactakara Forest. 
#822$# They don't much like outsiders.|
44656|#821$# Cactakara Forest is a quiet place, very restful. 
#822$# It's said that an Eidolon who likes to meditate shows up there on occasion.|
44661|What are those secret altars that appear in odd places?|
44662|I wanna know about the Eidolon Altars.|
44663|#821$# The Eidolon Altars are broken now, but if many people work together, they can be restored. 
#822$# When a portal is opened, one can communicate with the Eidolons on the other side.|
44664|#822$# Though Eidolon Energy for the altar is difficult to collect, it's not impossible.
#823$# I'm sure sufficient quantities can be collected, with help.|
44665|#822$# All we must do is offer the Eidolon Energy to the broken altar, and, gradually, it will be restored.|
44666|#821$# The altars have the power to send telepathic messages from people to Eidolons. 
#822$# Be respectful. The Eidolons will be unhappy about being summoned. 
#823$# They want to make contact with Envoys, but who likes to be woken up by a stranger?|
44671|Please tell me about Eidolon Skills.|
44672|What do you use Eidolon Skills for?|
44673|#821$# With the skill Taunting Eidolon, the Eidolon taunts the enemy, drawing the enemy's attacks.|
44674|#821$# The power of the Ultimate Strikes you and your Eidolon can work together is astonishing. 
#822$# Don't wait, use the Ultimate Strike immediately!|
44675|#821$# Each of us has different origins and strengths, so the skills we have are also different. 
#822$# Carefully picking an Eidolon who complements your own strengths can make your adventure easier.|
44676|#822$# Eidolons can do more than fight. 
#821$# Some can even serve as their Envoy's mount!|
44681|Please tell me something about Party Search.|
44682|I want information about the Party Search.|
44683|#821$# Party Search allows you to recruit party members quickly, to get into a dungeon faster.|
44684|#823$# Using the Party Search System greatly reduces the amount of running around involved in recruiting adventurers. It's very convenient!|
44685|#824$# After forming a party, you must try to get along with the others. They're protecting your back, treat them with respect.|
44686|#822$# When you need to enter a dungeon in Multiplayer Mode, you can look for party members with the Party Search System.|
44691|What is the Envoy's Path?|
44692|How should I choose my way on the Envoy's Path?|
44693|#821$# You will get one Envoy's Path Point every three levels. You must spend it wisely.|
44694|#824$# Don't lose heart if you encounter difficulties when you attack a dungeon; try reallocating your Envoy's Path Points.|
44695|#822$# You can even get new Combination Skills, based on which paths you choose.|
44696|#823$# Choosing different ways on your Envoy's Path will lead to different Skill Points.|
44701|How do you train yourself in unarmed combat?|
44702|Who taught you unarmed combat?|
44703|#821$# To maintain quick reactions, I spend a lot of time reviewing the basics every day. 
#822$# It's been my habit since I started in the martial arts.|
44704|#822$# Though I'd like to answer your question, I can't tell you who taught me. You're safer not knowing.|
44705|#823$# There's nothing particularly worthy of mention. Long story short, hard training. 
#821$# If you want to learn to fight like me, I'm more than happy to  give you some guidance.|
44706|#824$# I've been away from my organization for so long... The only thing that hasn't changed might be my martial arts skills.|
44711|How do you get such a healthy skin color?|
44712|How do you get so tan?|
44713|#823$# Hee hee, this looks pretty natural, doesn't it? 
#821$# I spent a long time living in a sunny place. 
#822$# The tan has stayed with me ever since!|
44714|#822$# I didn't go sunbathing, not on purpose. My skin color comes naturally.|
44715|#822$# I don't think about my skin, beyond basic hygiene. 
#823$# It doesn't really matter.|
44716|#821$# If you get out in the sun more often, you can have a tan of your own, too.|
44721|Do you often recall your past?|
44722|Do you think about the past a lot?|
44723|#824$# My past... That was a dark time in history... 
#824$# Even if the whole world has forgotten, I'll always remember...|
44724|#821$# The past isn't gone; it is just underneath the present. 
#822$# So even if the past has been forgotten, it doesn't mean things never happened... 
#824$# And, no, I haven't forgotten.|
44725|#821$# Of course I think about the past occasionally. Don't we all?|
44726|#823$# Talking about my past dredges up some rather unpalatable memories. Let's change the topic.|
44731|Have you ever faced multiple enemies alone?|
44732|Have you ever been surrounded by enemies before?|
44733|#821$# Of course I have. It's a common thing to be surrounded by enemies in battle. 
#822$# Use terrain to your advantage, and you can separate your enemies and fight them one by one.|
44734|#822$# As long as you can find a way to defeat your enemies one by one, you don't have to worry even if you are surrounded.|
44735|#821$# I once went to Pandemonium, alone, and was surrounded by numerous demons there. 
#823$# But I'm standing right in front you, in one piece, talking and smiling, aren't I?|
44736|#824$# Being surrounded by enemies is nothing, compared to being betrayed by former comrades-in-arms...|
44741|Tell me a little bit about the other Eidolons.|
44742|I want to know the gossip of the Eidolons.|
44743|#824$# Bahadur seems to have a very mysterious past... Maybe you can get some information from him. 
#823$# Ah... On the other hand, don't try. Please just forget about what I said.|
44744|#822$# Tigerius Caesar is suave, and thus very popular among women wherever he goes. 
#823$# But I did hear that he keeps someone very special in his heart, and is a surprisingly nice guy.|
44745|#822$# Heh heh, Gigas is a big automaton, and his burly body often scares kids. 
#823$# At times like these, he never knows what to do. He's actually rather shy, under his bluster.|
44746|#822$# Quelkulan is not only good at healing, he also has profound knowledge in other areas. 
#821$# He's also said to have invested a lot of effort in defending the wilderness.|
44751|Which is your dominant hand?|
44752|Which of your hands is more dextrous?|
44753|#821$# My dominant hand is my right hand, though I wouldn't say I like my right hand better.|
44754|#822$# In battles and in daily life, I use my right hand more often.|
44755|#823$# If the right hand represents benevolence, the left hand represents justice. Which hand do you think better of?|
44756|#824$# As a whole, I'm more like the left hand. The left hand represents necessary evil.|
44761|Why do you look sad sometimes?|
44762|Is there something on your mind?|
44763|#821$# Really? Do I look too serious? 
#823$# I was thinking. That's my thinking face.|
44764|#822$# No, I'm ok, but thanks for asking.|
44765|#821$# If I told you I was once an assassin, would you believe it? 
#823$# Wow, the look on your face. Like I expected, you don't believe it, do you?|
44766|#824$# The way I did it... Can't be wrong...|
44771|Where do you get your clothes?|
44772|Does your outfit have a special meaning?|
44773|#821$# This is my battle suit; I have been wearing it for a long time. It fits me well, doesn't it?|
44774|#822$# There's a very special circle pattern on my skirt. Can you guess what that is? 
#823$# I'll give you a hint. This pattern has something to do with my origin.|
44775|#821$# This outfit suits me, doesn't it? 
#823$# It helped me a lot when I was working... in the past. But let's not delve too much into that...|
44776|#824$# If I keep wearing this outfit, I'm afraid that sooner or later, I'll be found by some...less-than noble past connections.|
44781|Do you have important partners?|
44782|Do you have trusted friends?|
44783|#821$# Of course I do. All people who are willing to trust me are my partners.|
44784|#821$# Establishing such a deep friendship is not easy, especially when it requires complete trust in others. 
#822$# But in order to protect the world, I'm willing to trust wholeheartedly.|
44785|#823$# Now, you're my most important partner!|
44786|#824$# I had a close friend, but something happened between us... 
#823$# Ah, I'm sorry, I shouldn't bother you with old news. Let's not talk about my past.|
44791|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what would you do next?|
44792|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what plans do you have after that?|
44793|#821$# Even if the parting day finally comes, I'm still willing to be there for you. 
#822$# Whenever you call my name, holding lilies, I'll come to you immediately.|
44794|#822$# If such a day truly comes, I guess that would be fate, you can't fight it. 
#824$# And I will give you my best wishes and leave you with a smile...|
44795|#822$# Even if we part one day, I'll never forget these days of our adventure together. 
#824$# I also hope that you can think of our time, when you see blooming white lilies on the roadside.|
44796|#824$# I believe that even if one day we disagree with each other, you still wouldn't betray me... Right?|
45501|Are there any types of people you think well of?|
45502|If you were to date, what would be your criteria?|
45503|#821$#Obedience is a necessary quality in a good subject.
#823$#But to those who obey, my hand can be surprisingly gentle.|
45504|#821$#I think well of those who put my needs before their own.
#822$#That said, one who does not cultivate and consider their own opinions would not be a partner worthy of me.|
45505|#823$#I would find it most capricious to find a partner skilled in dance, that we might perform complex steps together.|
45506|#823$#Know your place. When I feel like telling you, I will.|
45511|What's your favorite beverage?|
45512|What is your favorite thing to drink?|
45513|#821$#I enjoy bitter and spicy drinks; drinks with pungent aromas.
#824$#Sweet drinks do nothing for me.|
45514|#823$#An envenomed wine goes down easily. My lips tingle with every sip.|
45515|#822$#When I tire of beverages, I sometimes eat live arachnids.
#823$#There's a tickle, then a crunch, then a smooth center. Simply delicious.|
45516|#821$#It seems all my favorites are too poisonous for humans.
#824$#Alas, it's unfortunate that your kind are so fragile.|
45521|What do you do in your free time?|
45522|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
45523|#824$#What a imbecilic question. Have you taken no heed of my rank?|
45524|#821$At times, I climb high into the mountains and meditate to strengthen my powers.
#823$I want the thunder I call down to be able to ravage entire countries - worlds, even!|
45525|#823$#Think about it - I wasn't born such a graceful dancer.
#822$#The control and form I've achieved has required much training.|
45526|#823$#I seek out weaklings and etch into them an understanding of how pitiful they are.|
45531|Do you have a dream?|
45532|Tell me about your goals for the future.|
45533|#823$#Need you even ask? I wish for all to bow before the peerless beauty of my dance.|
45534|#822$#I aim to become the finest dancer in this world or any other.|
45535|#824$#My stark grace is a gift
#823$#that should be seen by the whole world. Don't you agree?|
45536|#821$#As a dominator of worlds, I shall need someone to manage my obligatory fan club.
#823$#Without a doubt, you are best-suited for the position.
#8232#You must proselytize others and win them over to me without fail. I trust you will tackle this endeavor with your customary gusto.|
45541|What should I do when I face strong enemies?|
45542|How do I deal with powerful enemies?|
45543|#823$#Strong enemies? Even the mightiest men and beasts crumble under the torment of my heavenly thunder!|
45544|#822$#When I meet a foe who dares to defy me, I take great pains to ensure they suffer for it.
#823$#As their body writhes in pain, they will have just enough awareness to realize the mistake they have made.|
45545|#821$#For those enemies who actually merit some manner of respect, I will dance my dance of destruction before them.
#823$#As my body shifts and gyrates, we will lay armies low before us.|
45546|#824$#My dance is a peerless wonder. If we are not victorious, the fault must lie with you.|
45551|What's special about the Oblitus Wood?|
45552|Could you tell me something about the Oblitus Wood?|
45553|#821$#Once, the Oblitus Woods were a beautiful forest where those who wished to forget their troubles would go.
#822$#Look now at how it has fallen to ruin - spider webs everywhere, miasma in the air...
#824$#It sounds like a delightful place to visit.|
45554|#822$#I have heard that the Varan have established a presence in these woods.
#823$#Shall we amuse ourselves by pulling the tails off of those lizards?|
45555|#824$#Just hearing the name "Oblitus Wood" bores me. Let us speak of other things.|
45556|#821$#It's said that a mournful wind shrieks and moans from around Ghostsweep Cave in the Oblitus Wood.
#823$#Perhaps such sounds would be the perfect accompaniment to my dance!|
45561|What do you think of Terra?|
45562|Tell me what you think of your time in Terra.|
45563|#822$#Sadly, Terra is an inferior plane to Pandemonium, or even the Aura Kingdom, because the march of time means that all will eventually decay.
#823$#However...I suppose there's a certain beauty in that sense of transience.|
45564|#821$#The land you inhabit is not all that exists in Terra.
#821$# Across the sea is another continent, even larger than this.|
45565|#822$#What is Terra to me? A trifling world, fragile as glass.
#823$Were I to dance with the fullness of my fury, I could obliterate this world.|
45566|#821$#After I win the undying love of all Terra with my dances,
#823$#I will use this realm as a base from which to achieve renown in all worlds.|
45571|What's the function of the Community System?|
45572|I'd like a few tips on the Community System.|
45573|#823$#Community System? I have no need of friends.
#822$#Perhaps such a system would be of use to you, though. Yes...go and make new friends, and tell the worthy among them to join with me.|
45574|#824$#It is unfortunate to see you fight alone. I know my company is all one might desire, but...
#822$#Banding together with others is a part of your human nature, is it not?|
45575|#822$#If you ask me, I think you chatter with your friends too much, when your attention ought to be focused on me.|
45576|#821$#It appears one can get "loyalty points" by greeting friends who are present.
#824$#Why am I mentioning this, you ask? Think for a moment.
#823$#If you accrue these points, you can trade them in for gifts befitting of my splendor and beauty.|
45581|I want information about Secret Stones.|
45582|Tell me the lore of the Secret Stones.|
45583|#821$#Secret Stone can stimulate one's latent potential, enabling their strength to surpass natural limits.
#822$#Perhaps they would be an asset to you, if you intend to overcome the handicap of your humanity.|
45584|#824$#Must you really ask me such a trifling question?
#822$#There are merchants in every town and province that can answer your mundane inquiries.|
45585|#822$#If a Secret Stone is upgraded, you can no longer trade it. Consider yourself forewarned.|
45586|#822$#You may reap a substantial harvest of EXP from Energy Secret Stones, so do not cast them away like a fool.|
45591|Do you know any secrets regarding Elemental Symbols?|
45592|Please tell me more about Elemental Symbols.|
45593|#822$#Eidolons can increase their strength by consuming Elemental Symbols, so be sure to give all you find to me.|
45594|#823$#These crystals, each inscribed with a symbol for one of the eight elements, contain extraordinary power - for those who know how to extract that power.|
45595|#822$#Eidolon spirits may sometimes receive Elemental Symbols by connecting with Gaia, but the process sounds too tedious for my liking.|
45596|#822$#Elemental Symbols are an important catalyst for Eidolon evolution. For my sake, you must endeavor to gather many.|
45601|Tell me more about your cool third eye.|
45602|What's the secret of your third eye?|
45603|#821$#When I open my third eye, destruction and torment flow from me like a mighty river, so I usually keep it closed.
#823$#Woe is surely upon the one against whom I open that eye!|
45604|#822$#My third eye is the focal point of my power. Even in Pandemonium, its destructive potential is feared.|
45605|#822$#When I open my third eye, I can call down mighty thunder from the sky, racking enemies with pain.
#823$#Be glad that I wink with it at others, and not at you.|
45606|#823$#It is impossible for a mortal to stand against the power of my third eye. Those who tried did not live to regret their foolishness.|
45611|Tell me about your giant fists.|
45612|Let's talk about how cool your punches are.|
45613|#821$#My body alone grants insufficient leverage to destroy enemies with my fists, so I guide them with telekinetic power.|
45614|#822$#My arms are able to hold manipulate the thunder from my third eye, allowing me even more variety in my attacks.|
45615|#822$#These giant fists can attack from any angle, and as I dance, my speed and power flows smoothly into every attack.
#823$#It is through constant motion that attack becomes defense, and defense shifts effortlessly to offense.|
45616|#822$#Are you questioning the subtle beauty of my attacks?
#1001$#Perhaps we should hold a sparring match. I sense you would quickly understand through experience.|
45621|Can you tell me about that fabric fluttering behind you?|
45622|What's that blue fabric that trails behind you?|
45623|#821$#It is just an accessory. I find its beauty enhances my own.
#823$#You must have your eye on me, to have noticed it¡K|
45624|#822$#Not -everything- about me is mystical. The cloth is just an accessory.|
45625|#821$#Beautiful, is it not? I hand-selected the bolt of cloth myself.
#823$#When I dance, every piece must serve to accentuate my graceful movements.|
45626|#824$#As a first-class dancer, it's only natural to have a favorite accessory, like silks or ribbons. It adds to the exotic appeal.|
45631|How did you come to dress like that?|
45632|Let's talk about your unique fashion sense.|
45633|#823$#My armor is made of an alloy found only in the realm of spirits. It cannot be compared to Terra's menial metals.|
45634|#821$#My armor has been tempered with defensive runes that blunt the force of magical attacks used against me.
#823$#But of course, it also looks excellent on me. Form AND function, dear.|
45635|#822$#I designed my shoes myself - no others held up to the rigors of my dancing.
#823$#A stable balance and a sure grip are an asset, whether in dance or in battle.|
45636|#824$Red and black have been a fetching fashion combination since the ancient days. Surely you're aware of that.|
45641|I want to know secrets about other Eidolons.|
45642|Can you tell me something interesting about other Eidolons?|
45643|#822$#I saw Aelius gazing up at a full moon with an expression full of sadness. 
#821$#The look of loneliness writ upon his visage was...surprising.
#824$#I almost did not think him capable of melancholy.|
45644|#822$#I have heard of a trickster sorceress named Kotonoha who is able to use strange magic to quickly restore one's life.
#823$#I do not yet understand the workings of her art, but I can appreciate its skill.|
45645|#821$#It is said that Yarnaros can fly faster than the west wind. Impressive for one with such a hulking form.
#823$#I wonder...if his unstoppable flight clashed with my thunder, which would prove stronger?|
45646|#821$#Sigrun's sword has been blessed over time by the souls she has ferried to the worlds beyond, making it able to cut even spirits.
#824$#You know what else is sharp? Her catty tongue. Scarce do I witness her equal in arrogance.
#823$#If I must contend with her haughty airs any longer, it will come to blows between us.|
45651|Why are you so passionate about dancing?|
45652|What's the reason you stick to the dancer's path?|
45653|#821$#Interacting with normal people bores me, honestly.
#823$#However, even the lowliest clod can recognize an amazing dance when they see it.|
45654|#822$#The art of movement is within my spirit, and dance is an outgrowth of that, equal parts beauty and battle.|
45655|#821$#As one dances, the rhythm of the body
#822$#is like a pendulum that swings in time with the pulse of the world.
#823$#If you understand an entity's life pulse, you also know how to destroy them utterly.|
45656|#822$#Dance is one of those things you can only appreciate by experiencing it with your own body. Perhaps...someday, I will teach you a few steps.|
45661|Tell me some tips for looking fabulous like you.|
45662|What's your secret to having such a toned body?|
45663|#822$#Regular exercise is the key. Even kings grow weak if they make the throne their nest.
#824$#By the look of things, you could stand to lay off the cake yourself...|
45664|#822$#Oh? Do you finally wish to have a perfect body like mine?
#823$#Dance with me, then! If you embrace my ways, one day you may have a body as desirable.|
45665|#823$#Your request is sincere, but I am unsure whether your human body is prepared for a Pandemonian weight management plan.|
45666|#822$#Being a spirit has its benefits, like not getting fat from this realm's food.
#823$#If the world were to end, I might lament the loss of your chocolate confections.|
45671|What's the reason you cover your eyes?|
45672|Why do you keep your eyes covered up?|
45673|#821$#Covering my eyes helps me block out distractions and concentrate.
#823$#In doing so, the power released by my third eye is capable of causing even greater torment.|
45674|#821$#I I were to unveil my eyes, my beauty would drive the world's women to inconsolable tears, fraught at their own appearance.
#824$#Tsk...such a simple answer; you ought to have known that.|
45675|#821$#My beauty has a way of catching wayward eyes, so I block others' gaze from meeting mine.
#824$#Thus, whatever I do, I can do with my full attention. 'Dance like no one is watching', as your culture's saying goes.|
45676|#822$#My gyrations are enough to send any audience into a frenzy. Letting them catch sight of my eyes would inflame their desires beyond what I wish.|
45681|Why is your skin is blue?|
45682|How'd you come to have blue skin?|
45683|#821$#Darling, it's all the venom I drink!
#822$#A glass of venom a day keeps the angels away! Why not try some yourself?|
45684|#822$#Are you interested in acquiring my unique complexion? Maybe if you add more spiders to your diet...|
45685|#822$#Long ago, I had a dusky shade of skin. But my diet in Pandemonium turned my skin this color, and now I can't picture myself any other way.|
45686|#822$#Well, in nature, colors like this serve both to attract a mate, and to signal the danger of a poisonous creature.|
45691|If we ended our pact, what would you do next?|
45692|If we had to say goodbye, what's in the cards for you after?|
45693|#824$#If the day came when we had to part, I would send you off with an unforgettable dance of farewell.|
45694|#821$#Even if you cease to be my most loyal fan, I will continue to dance. I will continue to battle, and I will continue to torment those who stand against me. That is my way.|
45695|#822$#You're not all that useful, but as humans go, you're one of the most interesting I've encountered.
#822$#If we were to part ways, it would likely take me a great deal of time to find someone else as amusing.|
45696|#822$#I would hope that long after we parted, my image would remain burned into your memories.
#823$#Perhaps then one day, it will be I who summons YOU.|
45801|What kind of weather do you like?|
45802|How do you feel about the weather?|
45803|#821$#I enjoy humidity. Gathering clouds and rain in the sky is my duty.
#822$#Naturally,  I favor overcast days, as well as a healthy downpour.|
45804|#822$#Sunny days always bring back so many memories. 
#822$#I have an old friend who loves to travel, but only on a sunny day. 
#824$#It's been a long time since we've fought together, side by side...|
45805|#822$#The weather doesn't affect my feelings overly much.|
45806|#822$#Ever-changing weather is simple one of the laws of nature.
#821$#I gladly accept all kinds of weather.|
45811|Do you have any tips for getting along with people?|
45812|Do you have any advice on how to get along with others?|
45813|#822$#Uh... Does that mean you don't have many friends? 
#821$#Don't be upset. It's their loss if they don't appreciate you. 
#822$#Besides, the way I see it, a small group of true friends is best.|
45814|#822$#Well... I've lived alone for ages, and I haven't talked to others like me for a very long time...
#824$#I'm afraid I don't know how to answer your question.|
45815|#822$#Well... I don't know too much about it either. 
#821$#But the way I see it, tolerance and patience is key.|
45816|#823$#Are you kidding me?
#821$#You are the only one I talk to every day. Have you ever seen me talking to others?|
45821|Does anything offend you?|
45822|What would make you angry?|
45823|#822$#For a man my age, there aren't many things I haven't experienced. 
#821$#Very few things anger me, but I do have one thing that I won't tolerate. 
#823$#I have a tender scale under my jaw. I'll kill anyone who touches it!|
45824|#821$# Heh. I had a short temper when I was young. The slightest thing would make me angry. 
#822$#Now that I'm old, I don't often have the energy to pay that kind of thing any mind.|
45825|#822$#Why do you mention this all of a sudden? 
#821$# Could it be that you've offended someone? 
#822$#If that's the case, I think you'd better go apologize. It's best to avoid any chance of future problems.|
45826|#822$#Heh, in my eyes, you are still but a child.
#821$#When a child makes mistakes, I don't think adults should be too hard on them.|
45831|What are your opinions on death?|
45832|What is death to you?|
45833|#822$#All creatures grow and wither. To me, death is just a new beginning.|
45834|#821$# I've lived for so many years, I don't think there's anything I haven't experienced.
#822$#If my death were to come in the next second, I will face it calmly.|
45835|#821$#You are still very young and are living the dangerous life of an Envoy. You will certainly witness a lot of death. 
#822$#Creatures in the world live and die, and bring life from death. Everything is cyclic. 
#821$#Try to keep your cool about it and enjoy life to the fullest.|
45836|#821$#Heh. You are still so young! Don't waste your life worrying about these things.
#822$#I'm the one who should give it some serious thought.|
45841|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
45842|How do you like to kill time?|
45843|#822$#Sometimes I take a nap, but not for more than a couple of decades.
#821$#By the time I wake, everything has changed!
#824$#The speed with which Terra changes leaves me with confused feelings...|
45844|#821$#I used to go visit my friends when the mood took me...
#822$#However, the last time I've seen them was centuries ago...|
45845|#821$#I don't have any hobbies, actually. How about you? 
#822$#Maybe we can do something together?|
45846|#821$#When I was young, I argued with others a lot. All it took was one wrong word and I'd get violent!
#822$#Thinking about that now, heh, I was really ignorant then... 
#822$Nowadays, I've embraced calmness and serenity. Why cause any more trouble if there's a peaceful solution?|
45851|What's special about the Triatio Highlands?|
45852|Could you tell me something about the Triatio Highlands?|
45853|#821$#The Triatio Highlands are a barren plateau. There's dust everywhere, and it's difficult for plants to grow.
#822$#All the birds, beasts and tribal people that live there are extremely ferocious!|
45854|#822$#Hmm... The Humans and Giants in Triatio Highlands have feuded for a long time.
#824$#In my opinion... It's impossible to avoid conflict when feeding your family is at stake.|
45855|#822$#Avians have lived here for generations, worshiping the Demon God Argus. They have fallen into darkness.
#821$#If you need to deal with the Avians, be very careful.|
45856|#821$#About the Triatio Highlands... Well, there's one thing that keeps bugging me. 
#822$#There are the remains of gigantic, mythical beasts everywhere, but no one has ever actually seen one alive. 
#824$#Could it be that all those mythical beasts have vanished and are hiding away in mountains and oceans?|
45861|Do you know how the world was created?|
45862|Can you tell me about the beginning of the world?|
45863|#821$#Oh, I don't want to patronize you...
#822$#When the sky formed, well, where did the earth come from? These kinds of questions are a mystery to me...
#823$#You remind me of a young child when you ask such questions.|
45864|#821$#The Cube of Gaia is divine; the Cube of Gaia is god!
#822$#That's the first lesson of creation written in our historical texts. Can you truly comprehend its meaning?|
45865|#821$#I heard that the Cube of Gaia didn't exist in Terra at first - it came from outer space!
#822$#After Terra's creation, the Cube of Gaia fell from the cosmos, no longer having the energy to keep itself up.
#821$#49 days later, the Cube of Gaia finally entered the world. Other than that, its origin is a complete mystery...|
45866|#821$#As the saying goes: "There are people beyond this person and skies beyond this sky." There are probably other heavens and other earths aside from ours.
#824$#I think you are clever enough to comprehend this idea.|
45871|I'd like to know about titles.|
45872|What are titles for?|
45873|#821$#Hmm? Does the fact that you are asking this mean that you are seeking fame and fortune?|
45874|#821$#You obtain Titles after you complete certain quests or defeat certain monsters.
#822$#They are great proof to your heroic quests!|
45875|#822$#Well, as far as I know, different Titles can enhance different abilities.
#823$#The effects of the Titlesvary wildly, so the more you collect, the better!|
45876|#822$#Rare Titles can be very hard to get, but offer excellent benefits. Don't give up hope!|
45881|I wanna know about costumes.|
45882|What's so important about costumes?|
45883|#821$#Well, I don't really know much about such things, so I can't really offer any advice...|
45884|#821$#I've heard a human saying: "Clothes make the man." Looking good gets you noticed and makes a statement!
#824$#Though, at the same time... There is such a thing as taking that too far...|
45885|#821$#Costumes must be fun; a dragon such as I doesn't know much about that though...
#823$#If you're curious, how about you talk about it with your friends? You'd be pleasantly surprised.|
45886|#821$#Well, I know there are five different categories of costumes; there are so many options with each type.
#824$#I am so amazed by the diversity you humans come up with...|
45891|Tell me about Eidolon Teams.|
45892|What are the benefits of forming Eidolon Teams?|
45893|#821$#The Eidolon Team is composed of your most loyal Eidolons. They are at your service and will fight for you.
#822$#Do remember that you cannot switch out team members during a battle, so plan wisely!|
45894|#822$#Heh, like the ancient saying goes - Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.
#823$#As long as you've formed your team to strike at your enemy's weakness, you'll be invincible!|
45895|#821$#You are brimming with talent and potential. Sooner or later you'll be famous and a favorite among all the world's Eidolons.
#824$#The thing is, when that day comes... I hope you won't forget me and all the time we spent together!|
45896|#821$#You can have a maximum of three Eidolons in your team. Frankly, with how difficult your quests are, I'm not sure it's enough!
#823$#Fortunately, you have excellent skills... Heh, I'm sure you will be fine.|
45901|You seem to have lived a very long time. Is this true?|
45902|Could you tell me your age?|
45903|#824$#Well... I'm sorry, but I can't give you an answer. 
#822$#It's not like I don't want to, it's just that I... Well, I don't know! Hah!|
45904|#822$#The King of the Triceragons is a 500-year-old dragon, but I'm sure I've lived longer...
#821$#Maybe you can guess how old I am?|
45905|#822$#Heh. You are truly curious! 
#821$#Why not make a guess?
#822$#Isn't it more fun if you were to find the answer for yourself?|
45906|#822$#The strength of Dragons is proportional to their age. The older we are, the stronger we become. 
#821$#So why don't you make a guess? Based on my strength, how old do you think I am? Pretty old, I suspect! Heh heh...|
45911|Do you have any relatives?|
45912|Do you have any siblings?|
45913|#821$#Ever since I could remember, I have always been alone. 
#822$#So... I'm really not sure if I have any actual relatives...|
45914|#822$#Dragons accept each other as one large family.
#821$#So, in a way, all Dragons are my relatives.|
45915|#821$#Hrm... Let's forget about me for a moment. How about you?
#822$#Do you have any siblings?|
45916|#822$#As far as I can recall, I don't have any siblings.
#821$#But I consider all Dragons to be my relatives!|
45921|Western Dragons are a lot like you. Do you share any similarities?|
45922|What's the connection between you and Western Dragons?|
45923|#822$#I'm not sure if there is a connection,
#821$#but I certainly hope not!
#824$#I can't bear the fact that they obsess over shiny things and gold so much....|
45924|#824$#Western Dragons... I just don't understand how they think.
#821$#Supposedly, they rest on a heap of gold coins!
#822$#That kind of greed astounds me...|
45925|#822$#I've wondered the same thing myself.
#821$#Perhaps Western Dragons are descendents of my kind... Hmmm|
45926|#822$#I... I have no idea. I hope you forgive me for providing no answer for you.|
45931|How do you take care of your scales?|
45932|Your scales are so beautiful! How do you take care of them?|
45933|#822$#Heh, kind of you to ask! I wash my scales every day with clean water to keep their luster.|
45934|#821$#You don't have any scales on your body, do you? Are you just curious?|
45935|#822$#Well... Nothing too special, actually.
#822$#I just make sure to wash them every day, that's all!|
45936|#822$#I've had centuries of learning how to take good care of my scales.
#821$#Even my diet contributes to their wonderful luster.|
45941|I wanna know some secrets about other Eidolons.|
45942|Tell me something interesting about Eidolons.|
45943|#822$#What? I am not the sort to talk about others behind their backs, so please don't ask again.|
45944|#821$#Yarnaros and I are both Dragons, but we have very different specialties.
#822$#Yarnaros is good at offense, while I excel at defense.|
45945|#822$#Sigrun is indeed worthy of the name "Champion of the Slain." She is brave as well as graceful.
#824$#She reminds me of an old friend...|
45946|#822$#Aelius's flame is quite unique as it can heal wounds.
#821$#I've never heard of a flame restoring life before - it's quite impressive.|
45951|Can I pluck your scales?|
45952|Would you give me one of your scales?|
45953|#822$#Uh, no. Definitely not!
#821$#My scales are linked to my strength. Without them, I won't be able to protect you anymore.|
45954|#821$#Am I not by your side every day?
#822$#If you want to see my scales, just look at me. Why would you need to collect them?|
45955|#821$#It's not that I can't give you one, I just don't understand why you would want them.
#822$#I've already sworn myself to be by your side. What more do you need of me?|
45956|#821$#A shed scale loses its luster and begins to crack, which is very unsightly.
#822$#But, if you insist... Sigh...|
45961|Is the legend "Carp Leaping Over Dragon's Gate" real?|
45962|Can a carp really transform to a dragon?|
45963|#822$#Heh. That's just people talking nonsense and creating inspirational tales.
#824$#If it's that easy to become a dragon, how come dragons are so rare?|
45964|#822$#That is ridiculously impossible.
#821$#Just because a carp can leap over the Dragon's Gate doesn't make it a dragon.
#822$#The strongest carp in the world is still just a carp.|
45965|#822$#Hmm, you are ever the curious one.
#821$#How about you journey to the Dragon's Gate and see for yourself?
#822$#As they say, "Seeing is believing". I'm sure it would be more convincing than whatever I say.|
45966|#821$#Well... I have heard the tales before, of course...
#822$#Having said that, I've never met a dragon that was once a carp.
#821$#So I guess "Carp Leaping Over Dragon's Gate" is just a tale for humans to strive for greatness.|
45971|What's your relationship with the Dragon Emperor?|
45972|You and the Dragon Emperor seem to be pretty close.|
45973|#822$#Heh. The Dragon Emperor and I used to go to battle together, so of course we become fast friends!
#821$#We fought in wars that raged across many realms - those were chaotic times!|
45974|#822$#The Dragon Emperor and I are indeed very close.
#821$#Back then... Cough! Hrm... It's better if you don't know about it.|
45975|#821$#Huh? Why do you mention the Dragon Emperor all of a sudden?
#822$# Ah... My guess would be that you heard that the Emperor has lent me his power.
#824$#Sigh... I miss those days when he and I fought side by side.|
45976|#822$#It's not that easy to explain the relationship between the Dragon Emperor and me.
#821$#Perhaps it is a tale I'll tell at a later time...|
45981|Can all dragons fly?|
45982|Is there a kind of dragon that can't fly?|
45983|#822$#I've never heard of a dragon that can't fly.
#821$#I suppose, however, that such a creature is not beyond the realm of possibility...|
45984|#821$#Dragons fly as fish can swim, as beasts can walk; it is in our nature.
#822$#Perhaps there are dragons that can't fly very well, but to be unable to fly entirely? I think not.|
45985|#822$#Haha, this is a joke, yes?
#821$#How is it possible for a dragon that doesn't fly to exist?|
45986|#822$#Are you saying that you've actually met a dragon that cannot fly?
#821$#Now I'm curious; could you please introduce me to this creature?|
45991|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
45992|What's your plan if we ever get separated?|
45993|#822$#Isn't it too soon to talk about parting ways?
#821$#You are still very young.  Living in the present should be most important to you.|
45994|#822$#Union begets separation, this is a rule of life.
#821$#Meeting you made me very happy; but if our parting day comes, I will solemnly accept that, as well.|
45995|#821$#You are an excellent Envoy of Gaia.
#822$#So even without me by your side, I believe you will still achieve greatness!|
45996|#822$#After our parting? Hmm...
#822$#Perhaps I will go visit old friends I haven't seen in quite some time.|
46101|Let's talk about feelings.|
46102|What are your thoughts on anger?|
46103|#823$#Emotions are like tides, they go either up or down.
#821$#Like the surge of an ocean, you should release your anger every once in a while.
#822$#If you let your anger build up inside you, it'll become too much to handle one day and you might go out of control.|
46104|#823$#Heh, you're in an interesting mood today!
#822$#Let us discuss the mysteries of emotion together.|
46105|#821$#As long as there is light, there will be shadow. It is the same with moods.
#823$#Anger is a negative mood and is the most easy to manipulate.
#822$#Hah, I hope you're not getting too bored with my musings.|
46106|#821$#...
#824$#Sorry about that, my friend. When it comes to thinking about anger, I just can't help thinking of a certain someone...|
46111|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
46112|What do you do in your spare time?|
46113|#821$#Oh, I actually do not require much leisure or rest, so don't worry about me.
#823$#No matter the case, providing you the best care imaginable is my most important duty.|
46114|#822$#I enjoy reading novels in my spare time. It's excellent to feel immersed into a world of imagination, don't you think?|
46115|#823$#When my service to you is not needed, I enjoy wandering alone through the deep sea currents.
#822$#I enjoy to calmly listen to the symphony of the ocean's currents - it is truly beautiful.|
46116|#822$#Hmm, sometimes I just like to be still when I want to relax.
#823$#How do you like to relax, when you can spare the time?|
46121|What do you think about etiquette?|
46122|What is etiquette, to you?|
46123|#821$#Courtesy is a necessary element for harmony amongst people, just like water is essential for life.
#824$#If proper etiquette is not observed, I believe people's souls will shrivel like a plant without water.|
46124|#822$#Ah, courtesy is the basis to becoming a well respected individual in society.
#823$#I believe that, if you follow my guidance, you will perform outstandingly well!|
46125|#823$#You should always be courteous and respectful, not only for others, but for yourself.
#822$#Only people who know how to respect everyone can face the world with a positive outlook.|
46126|#822$#Ah, I do believe you are already an excellent Envoy of Gaia.
#823$#If you were to somehow surpass your current level of etiquette, you will shine even brighter.|
46131|How do you keep yourself healthy?|
46132|Tell me the secret to maintaining good health.|
46133|#821$#If you want a healthy and strong body, I'd recommend swimming when you can spare the time.
#823$#I find water sports to be a spiritual activity where you can easily release stress and strengthen the muscles.|
46134|#822$#Oh, don't worry too much about your health as long as you have me around!
#821$#Just follow my guidance and you'll be happy and healthy for years to come!|
46135|#822$#Ah, about that... I have heard that some believe that the state of one's mind can affect the body.
#823$#Perhaps, if you want to be healthy, you should start with spiritual exercises.|
46136|#821$#A balanced diet is one good way to keep healthy.
#822$#Taking up cooking is a good way to try new things and keep yourself in good health.|
46141|What do you look for in a person?|
46142|What qualities do you find attractive?|
46143|#824$#Erm, is this line of conversation appropriate to have? I wonder...|
46144|#823$#Hm, what's got you wondering about such a question?
#822$#Heh, perhaps you would enjoy trying to guess?|
46145|#821$#Well, since you asked nicely, I'll level with you.
#823$#I'm honestly not concerned with such base feelings as love and attraction.
#822$#My only goals are to be honorable and well respected.|
46146|#822$#Ha... I'm flattered that you care about me so much. 
#823$#People who care about their team mates, like you do, are probably the best kind of people in the world.|
46151|What's special about the Whirlpool Abyss?|
46152|Can you tell me about the Whirlpool Abyss?|
46153|#821$# Ha... Actually, most of the time I enjoy sleeping in this oceanic trench surrounded by high-pressure water and whirlpools
#822$#The Whirlpool Abyss is the only entrance to that area.|
46154|#821$#Ah, I have many disciples who journey to the Whirlpool Abyss in hopes of meeting me.
#821$#Mortals must pass the test before they can finally meet with me, however.|
46155|#822$#The entrance to the Whirlpool Abyss is within a lake that has a giant whirlpool.
#823$#Only those who dare to jump into the whirlpool can eventually make it to the Abyss.|
46156|#823$#I've heard that there is another place out there that is very similar to the Whirlpool Abyss.
#821$#I'd like to pay it a visit, if I can only find the time.|
46161|What are some special sightseeing spots on the Helonia Coast?|
46162|Can you tell me something interesting about Helonia?|
46163|#821$#Aside from being excellent with business management, the residents of Helonia are all pro anglers.
#821$#They are especially proficient at catching tuna, the fish for people who love a challenge.|
46164|#822$#Folks living along Helonia Coast flourish from the bounty of the sea and hold it in high regard.
#823$#Their love for the sea is why I reside in that nearby whirlpool - I am drawn to their love for the mighty waters.|
46165|#821$#One of the most popular attractions of Helonia Coast is Windwhisper Meadow.
#822$#Whenever a gentle breeze blows across the plains, the imagine of a great ocean appears in my mind. It's beautiful!|
46166|#821$#There's a notorious cave that lies in the north of Helonia Coast. I've heard tales of horrendous monsters dwelling there.
#822$#Do be careful if your path leads you to that cave...|
46171|Tell me something about Adventurer Medals.|
46172|Do you have any information about Adventurer Medals?|
46173|#821$#Adventurer Medals are proof of a hard working Envoy of Gaia!
#822$#If you continue to rack up points from these medals, it'll reflect well on your character sheet.|
46174|#823$#I hear that if you can manage to obtain the highest level of Adventurer Medals you can get extremely rare rewards!
#822$#I'll give you my full support when you decide to take on these tasks, for sure!|
46175|#822$#To obtain Adventurer Medals you'll have to work hard on a wide variety of achievements.
#821$#If you want to try to collect them all, it'll take a lot of work in many different fields of expertise!|
46176|#821$#There are two different types of Adventurer Medals: the easier regular Medals and then the Grand Achievements.
#823$#If you keep completing the achievements to get the regular Medals, eventually you'll work your way up to a Grand Achievement as well!|
46181|What can you tell me about swimming?|
46182|I wanna know more about swimming!|
46183|#822$#Ah, the joys of swimming! It is a great activity for strengthening the body and the mind.
#823$#You can cultivate a strong physique while taking in the beautiful scenery. It's a great way to relax.|
46184|#821$#There are a few hidden locations that can only be found by swimming to them.
#822$#If you have some time, you should try to find those hidden places on your map.
#823$#Doubtlessly it'll be a great experience to discover something new!|
46185|#822$#Oh? Do you have an interest in swimming?
#821$#Stick with my strict training regimen and you'll be a pro swimmer in no time!|
46186|#822$#My best swimming tip is to properly regulate your breathing in a precise rhythm.
#823$#Once you establish a set rhythm and stick to it while you swim,
#821$#you'll be able to efficiently use all your strength to the max!|
46191|Do you have any dungeon tips?|
46192|Let's discuss dungeon strategies.|
46193|#822$#You must be sure to prepare all your equipment and potions before tackling a dungeon.
#821$#I find that it is absolutely necessary to be prepared for any kind of situation and react swiftly.|
46194|#823$#Before you even set foot in a dungeon you should do some research about the bosses you will encounter.
#822$#Once you have pinpointed their weaknesses, you'll be able to clear your way through the dungeon in no time flat!|
46195|#823$#When facing powerful enemies, it is important to equip gear with the correct kind of resistance.
#821$#When you seem to be incapable of defeating your enemies, check your gear and make the necessary upgrades.|
46196|#821$#Bringing along potent potions created through alchemy will momentarily increase your strength substantially.
#822$#If you use these items in battle, you'll be a definite credit to the team.|
46201|Do you have any siblings?|
46202|Can you tell me something interesting about your family?|
46203|#821$#How kind of you to ask after my family! I do have two family members, but I haven't seen them in a long time...|
46204|#821$#My eldest brother is rather cranky, yet he is an extremely brave warrior of high status.
#822$#When he is angered, I've heard that he can destroy any mountain he comes across...|
46205|#822$#Ah, now that you mention it... I haven't talked much about my family, have I?
#823$#If we ever have a chance, I'd love to introduce you to my youngest sister.|
46206|#823$#Hmm, I, too, am interested in knowing more about your family.
#821$#Let's take some time to get to know each other better, shall we?|
46211|Why are you always smiling?|
46212|How do you manage to always be in such a good mood?|
46213|#823$# Ha... I'm a professional! I'm always supposed to have a smile on my face.|
46214|#822$#My best tip for a good mood is to face everything, good or bad, with a positive attitude.
#821$#I fully believe that this is the path to leading a happy and stress-free life.|
46215|#821$#Just being with a great Envoy of Gaia such as you fills me with joy!|
46216|#823$# Ha... A smile on one's face does not always mean happiness, don't you agree?|
46221|Do you know of the Miasmic Serpent, Quelkulan?|
46222|What's your relationship with Quelkulan?|
46223|#821$#Hmm? Oh, there's nothing particularly to mention about it. We've come across each other's paths often is all.|
46224|#821$#Hah, can you believe that many people mistake me for Quelkulan?
#823$#Once, even Gigas mistook me for him...and we almost got into a terrible fight over it!|
46225|#821$#Hmm, well... I don't have the amazing poison techniques that Quelkulan has.
#822$#So, I guess, in that area I may have a bit to learn.|
46226|#822$#Quelkulan and I do seem a little alike, it's true...
#823$#I expect that he tries to support you as well as I do, right?|
46231|Where do you live?|
46232|What kind of environment do you like to live in?|
46233|#821$#I prefer to dwell in the depths of the whirlpool, hidden in the ocean deep.
#823$#I find it to be the best place to contemplate my existence...|
46234|#823$#Long, long ago, I lived in a place that I once called "Paradise."
#821$#But I ended up moving out - I much prefer my new home.|
46235|#823$#For me, being in the deepest ocean is the same as living on the ground as humans do.
#822$#I know everything happening in the world through communicating with the ocean's many creatures.|
46236|#821$#Sometimes, I'm not so sure if my current dwelling is as good as the Paradise I once lived.
#822$#However, the quiet of the sea is an excellent place for thinking...|
46241|Do you know any Eidolon secrets?|
46242|Any interesting gossip going around about the Eidolons?|
46243|#821$#I used to see Uzuriel quite often, but she has become more secretive of late.
#824$#I wonder how she is doing now...|
46244|#822$#Heh, well, Zaahir is a rude guy with an extremely high body temperature, you know?
#824$#These attributes of his remind me of my elder brother every time I see him.|
46245|#822$#Sigrun is a reliable friend full of vim and vigor.
#823$#The only problem I have with her is that she sometimes speaks a but too bluntly. As such, some people tend to keep their distance from her...|
46246|#823$#Hmm... Vermilion is a quiet girl.
#822$#She's very attached to that birt she keeps around. It's as though the two have a spiritual connection.|
46251|Do you like cold weather?|
46252|You look so pale, are you cold?|
46253|#822$#Although I may look pale, the cold doesn't really affect me at all.
#821$#Rather, I actually enjoy the cold weather quite a bit!|
46254|#823$#The Whirlpool Abyss where I live is always under high pressure and extremely low temperatures.
#821$#Once you live in a place such as that, you become accustomed to such cold climates.|
46255|#822$#Ah, do you dislike the cold?
#823$#It doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I rather love the cold weather!|
46256|#823$#Oh! This is actually the first time I've ever been asked this.
#821$#See my scales? They actually cover me so perfectly that I retain all my body heat.
#822$#Cold water is no threat to me as long as my scales are in good shape!|
46261|Do you have any hopes and dreams?|
46262|What wish would you love to come true?|
46263|#822$#I don't want too much, really. As long as I keep fighting by your side, I think I'll be happy!|
46264|#821$#Actually, I haven't seen my family in thousands of years...
#824$#I'd...really like to see them again if given the chance.|
46265|#821$#Hm? What's got you asking these questions? Do you really care about me that much?
#822$#Lately, with you, I've been pretty happy in my life. My main hope is for us to continue to succeed in all our goals.|
46266|#822$#Enough about me, how about I ask you a question?
#823$#What are your hopes and dreams? It would make me happiest if I could help you attain all your goals!|
46271|How does it feel to control the tides?|
46272|Is it difficult to be master of the seas?|
46273|#821$#Hmm, it's a bit hard to explain the feeling of becoming one with the raging seas...
#824$#Please forgive me, I just have no idea how to explain this one right now!|
46274|#821$#I don't know if humans have anything similar, but becoming one with the tide is the most amazing feeling in the world.
#822$#Just imagine being one with one of the most powerful elements in our world...
#823$#It is a truly marvelous feeling, indeed!|
46275|#822$#When I ride the tide, I feel as if I am the sea itself, as if we share a heartbeat...
#821$#Perhaps, someday, you'll be able to experience a feeling as great as this.|
46276|#823$#Sometimes I simply enjoy relaxing on top of the waves while I enjoy the rhythms of the ocean currents.
#822$#I only remember where I am when I feel a wave crashing against a rock!|
46281|Do you like the ocean?|
46282|What makes the ocean so special to you?|
46283|#821$#I'm not sure I "like" the ocean...but I do feel deeply attached to it.
#824$#After thousands of years, the sea is the only thing that stays with me and never changes.|
46284|#822$#Initially I had no particular interest in the ocean, I just came here out of obligation.
#823$#After so much time has passed, however, I've grown to feel as one with the great oceans.|
46285|#823$#Hah! I reside in the deepest oceans, how could I dislike it?
#821$#That's enough about me, what about you? Do you enjoy the deep blue oceans too?|
46286|#821$#I believe that the ocean is critical for the life of all things on Terra.
#823$#As someone who's life is intertwined with the ocean, I have a deep sense of gratitude towards it.|
46291|If we ever had to part ways, what would your plans be?|
46292|What are your plans after we part ways?|
46293|#821$#If that day ever comes, I hope that I would have at least fulfilled all your wishes and served you well on this great land.|
46294|#822$#I have experienced such things before, as I have been alive for as long as the ocean's current flows.
#821$#The day will come, of course, but when it does we should not feel sad. Let us remember the good times.|
46295|#821$#If the day comes that we finally must part ways...
#823$#Well, I'll wish for the best for you in your future endeavors.|
46296|#821$#I will retire to the deepest abyss of the ocean.
#822$#While there, I will continue carrying out my tasks as a dragon of the oceans, fulfilling my age old promises...|
46401|How do you go about training?|
46402|How can I become as strong as you are?|
46403|#822$#Strength must come from within.
#821$#You need to train the body and the mind as one.
#823$#Because of this, I spend as much time meditating as I do practicing for battle.|
46404|#822$#Even the most basic training regiment is not a wasted effort.
#821$#So long as you are pushing yourself, you will make progress.|
46405|#821$#Hmm... You must have knowledge, understanding, courage, and diligence.
#824$#If all of these attributes work in harmony, you can achieve anything.|
46406|#821$#We are all so different... I can only give you so much advice.
#822$#What works for me might not work for you,
#824$#so feel free to experiment to find the best method.|
46411|Do you have any weaknesses?|
46412|Are there things that you fear?|
46413|#821$#We all have weaknesses, and some are difficult to admit.
#824$#I carry a poison inside of my body. I can cope with it, but if it were to be released it may endanger many lives.|
46414|#822$#I fear that one day I might not be able to fly any more.
#824$#To be confined to the ground again seems a fate worse than death.|
46415|#821$#I worry that I am already the fastest dragon in the world.
#822$#Wouldn't that be just awful? There would be no one left to challenge.|
46416|#821$#I fear losing my abilities. What if I could no longer control the winds?
#822$#I suppose I would adapt after a time, but the thought still worries me.|
46421|What do you think it means to be powerful?|
46422|What is strength to you?|
46423|#821$#Ha! That you have to ask shows how different you and I are.
#822$#The answer, friend, is speed. Speed is power!
#823$#What good does all the muscle in the world do if you cannot hit your target?|
46424|#821$#I will swear by speed over outright strength.
#822$#Those who can dance around their opponents can control the battle as they please.|
46425|#821$#I am of the opinion that simply avoiding attacks is far more powerful than suffering them.
#823$#Put on some nimble gear that ups your EVA and see for yourself!|
46426|#823$#Ha! I control entire battles simply by being nimble!
#821$#How about you, friend? What is your definition of power?|
46431|What do you like doing in your spare time?|
46432|Tell me about your hobbies.|
46433|#821$#I love to eat snakes!
#823$#Few things are as wonderful as chowing down a slithering handful of serpents... Delicious!|
46434|#821$#I love the mountains. Whenever I see a tall peak, I must fly to the top and let out a huge howl.
#823$#It's wonderful stress relief! Next time I will take you with me.|
46435|#824$#Ha! Um... This is a bit embarrassing, but...
#822$#Who needs hobbies when they have an Envoy like you to travel with? I could do this all day, every day!|
46436|#822$#You know all of those adventures you and I have gone on, all those monsters we have faced?
#823$#In my spare time, I've been writing all of them into a journal!|
46441|Do you like riddles?|
46442|Are you good at word games?|
46443|#824$#Ugh! I don't see the point. I have no patience for those sort of games.|
46444|#822$#If it means that much to you, I suppose I can play along. 
#824$#But if you ask me to bet with real money, I swear I will leave and never come back. Seriously.|
46445|#821$#I really don't understand the point of them. At all.
#824$#Why waste so much energy with trivial, pointless matters? It boggles the mind.|
46446|#823$#It's difficult enough to speak clearly and concisely; why someone would deliberately obfuscate their speech is beyond me.|
46451|What's so special about Ventos Prairie?|
46452|Can you tell me anything about the Ventos Prairie?|
46453|#821$#I've been to the Ventos Prairie many times!
#823$#I love the sound of the wind as it rustles softly through the tall grass.|
46454|#821$#The Ventos Prairie is very beautiful, and is home to the strong and proud Makar tribe.
#822$#However, the Makar also seem to be quite arrogant, and don't get along easily with outsiders.|
46455|#821$#An ancient circle of stones in the Ventos Prairie is used as a combat arena.
#822$#There the Makar hold great tournaments to compete for their tribe's highest honors.|
46456|#821$#In a dark corner of the Ventos Prairie is a mysterious building called the Wrathborne Temple.
#821$#Surrounding it is a strange aura, as if there was some terrifying and otherworldly presence inside.|
46461|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
46462|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
46463|#821$#We Eidolons hold the Cube of Gaia in the highest regard.
#822$#How could we not? It created this world and all the life in it.|
46464|#823$#The Cube of Gaia created me, and gave me the powers I have.
#821$#Sometimes I do stop and think what might have happened if I was not given these powers...
#822$#What would my life be like now?|
46465|#821$#The ability to create life is so strange, almost mythical.
#824$#That is why people all across the world want the Cube of Gaia for themselves.|
46466|#822$#It's impossible to imagine what the Cube of Gaia might be like. How big is it? What would it be like to touch it?|
46471|Tell me more about Secondary Classes.|
46472|What's up with Secondary Classes?|
46473|#821$#When you reach level 40, you can learn how to use a Secondary Class.
#823$#This allows you to use a second weapon type and all of it's associated skills!|
46474|#821$#Certain combinations of classes will allow you to perform devastating Dual Skills.
#822$#Take a look through your Envoy's Path to see what ones you can learn.|
46475|#821$#Once you pick a Secondary Class, you're stuck with it!
#823$#Make sure you have carefully considered your fighting style before you choose your Secondary Class.|
46476|#822$#Choose a Secondary Class that complements your Primary Class, and you can become much stronger!|
46481|I'd like to learn more about skills!|
46482|What do you know about skills?|
46483|#821$#Some skills just deal damage, while others inflict debilitating effects. Sometimes both!
#824$#Are you saying you didn't know that? Are you sure you're qualified to be an Envoy?|
46484|#822$#There are fiends out there with truly vicious skills; some that can even wipe you out in a single hit!
#821$#Fortunately, you have plenty of skills of your own to counteract these.|
46485|#821$#Raising your SPD stat also decreases the cooldown time of all your skills!
#823$#If you want to use your big-hitting skills as often as possible, you'll need plenty of SPD.|
46486|#821$#Every Eidolon has a Combo skill that is supremely powerful, but with a very long cooldown.
#822$#You must use your head to determine the best time to use these skills.|
46491|Tell me what you know about Fame Quests.|
46492|What's so special about Fame Quests?|
46493|#821$#Such enthusiasm! I didn't know you were interested in Mirabelle's charity group. Or are you just interested in the rewards?|
46494|#822$#Fame Quests can be found posted on Mirabelle's Bulletin Board.
#823$#All sorts of interesting quests can be found there; investigations, rescue operations, treasure hunts... You should check it out.|
46495|#821$#Fame Quests get posted every day on the bulletin board in each zone.
#822$#If you don't see any suitable quests to undertake, try again the next day.|
46496|#821$#Of course, no Fame Quest would be complete without a luxurious reward from the requester.
#823$#It's even been said that occasionally someone will offer rare gear you can't get anywhere else!|
46501|How fast can you fly?|
46502|What's your top flight speed?|
46503|#822$#Some people think that I utilize the wind in order to fly.
#821$#This is not the case! I fly so quickly that I create the wind itself!
#823$#What could be faster than that?|
46504|#821$#Ha! At top speed, I am even faster than sound.
#823$#Even the sound of my roar is left behind me.|
46505|#821$#I fly so quickly, it's impossible for someone to focus on me. I appear as just a green blur.
#823$#This is how I earned the nickname of the Emerald Tempest.|
46506|#821$#Haha! Don't you worry about a thing!
#823$#My speed is more than enough to keep you safe on the battlefield.|
46511|Can you tell me the secret of your golden wings?|
46512|What is so special about your golden wings?|
46513|#822$#My wings? There are no other wings like them anywhere!
#821$#They give me the ability to launch through the sky at top speed, and then come to a stop immediately.
#823$#My golden wings give me both speed and the ability to control that speed.|
46514|#821$#Ha! Since you asked so politely...
#822$#My wings aren't just for mobility; they also let me engage many enemies.
#823$#If I flap them with enough force, they can send out shockwaves. How cool is that?|
46515|#821$#My wings can transmute some of the poison inside of my body,
#823$#then release it to power up my allies!|
46516|#824$#I can't go giving away all of my secrets, can I?
#822$#I suppose it doesn't matter. What would someone like you do with my secrets?
#823$#Ha! It would take you centuries to learn how to fly like I do!|
46521|Tell me about your claws.|
46522|Is there anything special about your claws?|
46523|#822$#Tell you about my claws? Okay...
#821$#Actually, I think you might still be too weak to understand.
#824$#My claws are infinitely profound; only the most wisened mind can grasp their true nature.|
46524|#822$#A long time ago I received a blessing from a dear friend, which allowed my claws to harness the wind.|
46525|#821$#My claws? Ha! There is nothing sharper in all the lands!
#822$#In my youth, I would fly about so recklessly...
#823$#If a mountain appeared in my path, I would just slice it in half and keep on going!|
46526|#821$#With just a turn of my palm, my claws can summon the wind to them.
#823$#That wind gives me incredible speed and strength.|
46531|Have you been surrounded by enemies before?|
46532|How do you deal with being surrounded by enemies?|
46533|#821$#Ha! If I am ever outnumbered, I will just spread my wings and fly away!|
46534|#822$#Let them try! I can stir up a ferocious wind that will blow away any number of enemies that try and surround me.|
46535|#821$#To be surrounded assumes you have let someone get behind you...
#823$#Which has yet to ever happen to me, thanks to my unbeatable speed!|
46536|#824$#I must admit that this has never happened to me.
#821$#My speed and my ability to fly has kept anyone from ever getting the drop on me.
#822$#Sometimes I wonder how I would handle it if I were to be surrounded...|
46541|Tell me about the other Eidolons.|
46542|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
46543|#821$#Sigrun is a bold and noble warrior who is completely uninterested in anything mundane.
#822$#She never beats around the bush; she laughs when she is happy and shouts when she is angered.
#823$#I appreciate her straightforward nature, and have always enjoyed our conversations.|
46544|#821$#My friend Aelius is a tremendous artist, gifted in music and poetry.
#822$#He just always looks so sad under that hood. I wonder what's eating him.|
46545|#822$#Oh, Bel-Chandra... You might want to keep your distance from her.
#821$#Outwardly she seems beautiful, and dances with an unmatched grace.
#824$#But she is truly frightening when she is angry! I still have nightmares...|
46546|#823$#Kotonoha is beautiful and kind, and in particular loves all small animals.
#822$#It's strange, though. Other than foxes, animals don't seem to like her very much.
#821$#Huh. I wonder why that is.|
46551|How does it feel to harness the wind?|
46552|What does it feel like to manipulate the wind?|
46553|#821$#Hmm... It's a unique feeling that's difficult to put into words.
#822$#How about this... When you have some free time, I'll take you for a ride up in the sky.
#823$#You can experience for yourself what it's like to fly!|
46554|#821$#To harness the winds is like ruling the world.
#823$#When you are in flight, all the creatures of the world can only watch and admire you!|
46555|#821$#It is like I have become one with the winds, and I breathe as the world itself breathes.|
46556|#821$#It is a very comfortable openness.
#822$#It is a sense of freedom unlike anything you've ever felt before.
#823$#Plus, doing loop-de-loops is an incredible amount of fun!|
46561|Where do you come from?|
46562|Where did you live before now?|
46563|#822$#I used to live in a palace on the highest peak of a steep mountain very far from here.
#821$#One wing of the palace had a tower that reached up into the clouds...
#822$#I smile whenever I think about it. Those were good times.|
46564|#822$#The palace I once lived in is far more magnificent than anything you've seen built on the ground.
#824$#The ancient sky-builders were far more advanced than any architect you have now.|
46565|#821$#It was a mysterious palace, full of huge murals inside and out.
#824$#These murals told stories of events that took place many millenia ago. I wish I'd taken the time to learn them all...|
46566|#822$#Is it really that important where I lived in the past? My life in the present is happy enough.|
46571|Do you have a partner?|
46572|Do you have many friends?|
46573|#821$#Yes, I do. My longtime friend and ally is a great and powerful king.
#822$#We have both saved one another's lives many times.|
46574|#822$#My closest friend is a powerful king of the old lands.
#821$#He's very much like you; a human with big dreams.|
46575|#821$#I had many allies in the long years of feuding and wars that preceded your known history.
#822$#It would take many months to tell you all of my stories!|
46576|#822$#You remind me of Ruyi, a friend of mine from long ago.
#821$#He passed his draconic powers onto me when he passed away, which is why I can control the wind.|
46581|Why do I never hear you roar like other dragons?|
46582|What's the secret of the dragon's roar?|
46583|#821$#My roar is unbearable. The noise is as frightening as the chilling cries of battle-field crows, only a hundred times as loud.|
46584|#822$#I cannot roar without releasing some of the poison trapped inside my body.
#824$#It would put you, and everyone else, at risk.|
46585|#821$#If I were to roar, I would release a toxic vapor.
#822$#Soon the entire world would be covered in poisonous clouds, and would become a wasteland.|
46586|#824$#It's not that I can't roar, it's that I choose not to.
#821$#If I roar, I will also release a deadly poison. I can't bring myself to do this.|
46591|What do you plan to do once our adventures together come to an end?|
46592|What would you do if we were to part ways?|
46593|#821$#Yes, one day we will no longer travel together, but we will still remember one another, right?
#822$#Just take a look up at the big wide sky... That's me waving to you!|
46594|#823$#I'll always remember our friendship, and I'll still root for you even if the whole world separates us.|
46595|#822$#I think I'll take some time to fly around and enjoy the feel of the wind before I decide what to do next.|
46596|#821$#Goodbye doesn't have to be forever, does it?
#823$#We may part, but I believe we'll reunite again at some point.|
47001|What is your favorite leisure activity?|
47002|How do you usually kill time?|
47003|#822$# I like to study the art of healing when I'm free, especially in the field of using venom to heal.  
#823$# Hsss... Venom doesn't have to hurt people. If the dosage is controlled, it can also be used to heal!|
47004|#821$# Sometimes I do nothing, and just contemplate silently.  Hssss... 
#824$# There's so much to learn from the world, if you just stop and look.|
47005|#822$# I try to develop venom's universal suitability for healing. I have been very successful to date.  
#823$# If you're interested, I can always use volunteers. I guarantee that you'll probably benefit from it!|
47006|#821$# I usually carry out research that's related to venom, a field filled with uncertainties.|
47011|Tell me about things that you hate.|
47012|What do you hate the most?|
47013|#822$# Hssss... What I hate most are people who stereotype others and throw me strange looks. 
#824$# I really don't get it sometimes - are snakes really so frightening?|
47014|#821$# Even though I can understand how others feel, I really don't wish to be hated just because of how I look.|
47015|#822$# There aren't many things that I hate. Usually it's the others who hate me.|
47016|#821$# Hsss... I really hate people who can't accept that others are different from them. 
#824$# Conflicts often occur when you have to deal with such people.|
47021|What's so good about travelling?|
47022|What can we learn when we travel?|
47023|#823$# The best thing about travelling is you are truly engaging this world. 
#822$# Hsss... Reading about it in books is not enough.|
47024|#821$# Hsss... You can make many new friends while travelling. Friends enrich your life.|
47025|#822$# Don't get hung up on the destination, or what you can get when you travel. 
#821$# As with all things, the most important thing is really the process of doing it.|
47026|#822$ Travelling gives you total freedom. You can decide your own direction, and your future.|
47031|What do you think knowledge is?|
47032|What's your definition of knowledge?|
47033|#823$ Hssss... There's a famous saying that goes, "knowledge is power." 
#822$ But have you ever considered whether power is equal to knowledge?|
47034|#821$ Hssss.... Knowledge can't be gained just by moving through life. 
#821$ You have to examine your experiences, if you want to learn from them.|
47035|#824$ Without knowledge, one is ignorant. But knowledge alone, without really living, is its own kind of ignorance.|
47036|#823$ Knowledge comes from experience, and experience is distorted by ego. Try to understand your own ego, so you can see the distortions.|
47041|What kind of climate do you like?|
47042|What kind of weather are you most comfortable in?|
47043|#823$# Hssss..... I feel most comfortable in warm, sunny weather. Cold weather makes me sleepy.|
47044|#822$# My skin is very sensitive to temperature. As soon as the temperature starts to change, I can feel it immediately.|
47045|#821$# Anyway, as long as the temperature doesn't change too quickly, I can accept all sorts of weather. 
#824$# Cold weather takes a while to get used to.|
47046|#824$# It's not that I'm weak, I just that I can't adapt to weather that fluctuates between hot and cold...|
47051|Have you heard about Pandemonium?|
47052|What's Pandemonium like?|
47053|#821$# Hssss... Pandemonium is truly another world - it's hard to describe to mortals.|
47054|#822$# It's said that Pandemonium is filled with terrifying things. I wonder if the demons who live there find Terra just as frightening.|
47055|#824$# Pandemonium is the residence of Demons. It seems to be quite turbulent recently, it could be that something has changed...|
47056|#823$# It's very difficult to go to Pandemonium from Terra. Strangely, it seems to be much easier to come here from other worlds...|
47061|Do you know that every place has its local specialties?|
47062|I hear that every place has its own unique, famous product?|
47063|#821$# The food of many areas is not only delicious, but can also give you bonus special skills.|
47064|#822$# To develop tourism, many cities and towns specially use local produce to make unique dishes.|
47065|#823$# The best way to relax from adventuring is to taste the local delicacies wherever you travel!|
47066|#821$# Hssss... Take care not to overeat when sampling delicacies. 
#824$# It's not worth it a bellyache, no matter how good it is.|
47071|I'd like to know more about casting and forging.|
47072|How do I make Enchanted Equipment?|
47073|#822$# It's said that, other than Knight Blacksmith Analisa, there's also an old man who can do it. 
#823$# I wonder who taught who?|
47074|#822$# As long as you've learned the formula, you can get forging and casting through Analisa of Navea. 
#821$# If you master this skill, all kinds of Enchanted Equipment will be at your fingertips!|
47075|#823$# Hssss... You can learn basic formulas from Knight Blacksmith Analisa. 
#821$# For the rarer formulas, you can only obtain them by defeating boss monsters in dungeons.|
47076|#821$# The greater your level of mastery with equipment casting, the better your chances of producing high quality equipment. 
#823$# If you want to have the very best equipment, work hard at improving your casting finesse!|
47081|Tell me about Full Set Effects.|
47082|I would like to know of Full Set Effects.|
47083|#823$# The Full Set Effect is not exclusive to store bought equipment and equipment that's dropped in the field. 
#822$# Equipment that's cast and forged by blacksmiths also has a Full Set Effect.|
47084|#821$# Hssss... Some equipment contains a specific Eidolons' Power of Gaia. 
#822$# If you manage to collect the full set, you will get the special protection of that particular Eidolon.|
47085|#823$# Hssss...Try to collect the full set of equipment that's dropped in an instance. 
#822$# This equipment, other than having a powerful Full Set Effect, can also be forged and cast further.|
47086|#823$# Hssss... Why do you suppose a full set of equipment it will trigger a special magic effect?
#824$# This is a question that's worth pondering over...|
47091|How can my Status be changed?|
47092|Please give me some tips on Statuses.|
47093|#821$# When one is adventuring, one will usually be affected by various statuses. 
#822$# Default status icons will show on the side of the small map. Check often.|
47094|#823$# Skills displayed by monsters will sometimes inflict very annoying negative statuses. 
#822$# If you try to avoid these, your battle will be much easier.|
47095|#822$# Hssss... Some statuses will greatly reduce your ability, and even bring you dangerously close to death. 
#823$# Always take note of your Status information, so as to improve your success in the battle.|
47096|#821$# Hssss... My venom is also a kind of status. 
#822$# Of course, it's the kind that really scares people.|
47101|Where does your Warm Mist come from?|
47102|Why is your recovery ability is so strong?|
47103|#823$# The tissues of my body are stimulated by my own venom, and heal continuously with shocking speed. 
#822$# This quick healing naturally contributes to my Warm Mist.|
47104|#822$# Hssss... This is hard to explain, as the relationship between my venom and my mist is complex.|
47105|#823$# As I'm filled with venom, my ability to recover is shocking. 
#821$# Hssss... You can understand my Warm Mist as an extension of this.|
47106|#822$# Hssss... Even though my Warm Mist is very strong, 
#824$# I still can't teach this ability to partners. What is a shame.|
47111|Have you caused trouble for others before?|
47112|Have you been a cause of trouble to others before?|
47113|#821$# Hssss... As my body is filled with venom, I easily intimidate other creatures. 
#824$# Which is why I'm very careful to maintain a safe distance with people.|
47114|#822$# Long, long ago, I once ruined a beautiful lake, in my carelessness. 
#824$# The locals suffered immensely, which is why I had to leave in a hurry...|
47115|#821$# Let's not talk about me for the moment. I guess you've also caused trouble for others before?|
47116|#822$# Hssss... The venom in my body has not only caused trouble for others. 
#824$# I even feel troubled by it myself, sometimes.|
47121|Is there a special use for your venom?|
47122|Can your venom be used for things outside of combat?|
47123|#822$# Hssss... It's said that some people will use venom to make food. 
#821$# I'm not sure it would be wise to use my venom like that...|
47124|#823$# Hssss... Venom is still venom. 
#822$# There are still few opportunities to use it outside of battle.|
47125|#823$# Hssss... You've really picked the right time to ask me this. 
#822$# I actually need a volunteer to help with some small experiments related to venom.|
47126|#823$# If my scales are ground into very fine powder, they can be made into antitoxins.  
#822$# It's just that effective dosage and fatal dosage are not that different.|
47131|Have you been almost fatally injured before?|
47132|Have you had near death experiences in battle?|
47133|#823$# Hssss... 
#821$# Actually, I don't have such strength as I had before. I  was very badly injured in a battle once... 
#822$# The flesh of my body changed, being affected by my own venom, leaving me as I am today.|
47134|#822$# Hssss... I can tell you that near death experiences aren't nice. 
#824$# You will lose your strength, slowly and surely, like a countdown to the end.|
47135|#821$# I was once very badly injured when I was fighting with other Eidolons.|
47136|#823$# In one fierce battle, my sworn enemy and I were both very badly injured, and we were both very close to death. 
#822$# However, I know that neither of us are afraid of death, as we are both fighting for our ideals.|
47141|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
47142|I want to hear gossip about the Eidolons.|
47143|#823$# Hssss... Word has it that Uzuriel once held a very mysterious, but important post in some organization. 
#822$# During that time, her nickname at the organization was "Left Hand."|
47144|#822$# Hssss... 
#824$# Gigas is the only one that I have nothing to tell you about.|
47145|#822$# Hssss... Tigerius Caesar got his title as the Feline Emperor due to his remarkable talent. 
#821$# There are still some people who are not willing to associate themselves with him. 
#823$# After all, talking to an arrogant and obnoxious person is quite an uncomfortable thing.|
47146|#822$# Hssss... The location of the underground command post of Bahadur's Army is a very closely kept secret.
#823$# Its internal passageways very complicated, which is why many people call it "the labyrinth."|
47151|How big are you?|
47152|Can you tell me how long you are?|
47153|#821$# Hssss... My length is my utmost pride. 
#822$# But I'm not sure exactly how long I really am.|
47154|#822$# Hssss... My body length? Why do you suddenly want to know this?|
47155|#823$# Hssss... My body length changes every year, 
#822$# I currently have 50 body segments, but I might have more next year.|
47156|#822$# A person's size is not a true representation of the person.
#821$# it's more important that he has substance.|
47161|How deadly is your venom?|
47162|How terrifying is your venom?|
47163|#823$# Hssss... As long as I'm willing, I can make a whole forest wither in an instant.|
47164|#821$# My venom is not only effective on living creatures.
#823$# It is  also effective against lifeless magic creatures and undead monsters.  
#822$# It can corrode their bodies till they fall apart!|
47165|#821$# Hsssss... My venom is definitely deadly.  
#822$# No matter how powerful the enemy is, he will gradually die after the venom spreads.|
47166|#824$# My venom cannot tell friend from foe. If you come across it accidentally, even I may not be able to save you...|
47171|Are you good at swimming?|
47172|Are you familiar with the water?|
47173|#822$# Hssss... I'm not afraid of water, but I will avoid rivers and lakes, so as to prevent my venom from spreading.|
47174|#823$# Hssss... I don't go near water because my scales are filled with venom. 
#822$# So I often avoid water, so that I don't cause unnecessary harm.|
47175|#824$# If there's ever an opportunity, I hope to enjoy myself to the fullest in the water.|
47176|#823$# Hssss... My movement in the water is also very fast.
#824$# I'll give you a chance to see it, next time.|
47181|How do you eat, usually?|
47182|Do you use your claws to put food into your mouth?|
47183|#821$# I simply open my mouth big and wide to swallow the food. Feeding myself is easy, even without hands.|
47184|#822$# Hssss... Have you seen animals eating with knife and fork? I think you haven't. 
#824$# So why would you think that snakes would need hands to eat? We just swallow the food directly.|
47185|#822$# Hsssss....When my lower jaw is stretched to its extreme, it can actually open to an incredible angle.
#823$# Therefore I just directly swallow my food when I eat.|
47186|#821$# Snakes are experts at swallowing food in one big gulp. Naturally, that includes me.|
47191|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what would you do next?|
47192|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what plans do you have after that?|
47193|#822$# Hssss... There's this saying, "All good things must come to an end." 
#821$# The day will come when we must finally say goodbye, but I won't forget you after we go our separate ways.|
47194|#823$# If we are separated, I'll continue to work hard at studying how venom can be used to heal.
#822$# Hopefully, one day I can bring better medicine to the people of this world.|
47195|#824$# Hssss... Separation doesn't mean that we won't ever see each other again. It's just that we both have our  own life directions.|
47196|#822$# I'll be touring around the world, contributing what I can to residents of remote areas.|
47301|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
47302|How do you kill time?|
47303|#821$# I like to lie on the grass and bask in the sun, when I've nothing else to do.
#822$# Unfortunately the grass always burns.|
47304|#823$# I train! Constant improvement can only come with persistent training!|
47305|#821$# What? I'm actually quite busy!
#822$# With what, you ask? Ha ha ha... I can't tell you.|
47306|#821$# Leisure activities? Hmm, well, I like bathing. 
#822$# I have to bathe quickly, as the water quickly turns to steam.|
47311|What is your favorite food?|
47312|Do you have a preference in food?|
47313|#823$# Strong as I am, I can eat anything, whatever it is!  
#821$# Most food is unsatisfying, though. It burns, even before I can put them into my mouth!|
47314|#822$# Hmm, well, I rather like the taste of lava! It's both crunchy and chewy.|
47315|#821$#  Aelius's flames taste good, but the texture is a bit too soft.  
#822$# Oh my, I really miss it! Gotta visit Aelius again!|
47316|#821$# As long as it's food that I can eat, I will eat it. 
#822$# It's not good to be picky with food, don't you think? Ha-ha!|
47321|What kind of weather do you like?|
47322|Any weather preferences?|
47323|#822$# Weather? For me, rainy and snowy weather are both quite troublesome! 
#821$# Rain and snow evaporate immediately, once they touch my skin. 
#822$# All the steam is irritating, but at least it gives me this mysterious look.|
47324|#821$# Do you really have to ask? My favorite weather is, of course, bright days where the sun is high and shining bright!|
47325|#822$# No matter what kind of weather it is, it'll be great if it's dry!  
#821$# Why? Steam is really very troubling....|
47326|#822$# Ha ha ha... Don't worry, don't worry. 
#823$# My fighting spirit will not diminish, just because of the weather!|
47331|What is a friend, as far as you are concerned?|
47332|What's the definition of friendship, in your heart?|
47333|#822$# A person who can share your joys and woes is a friend!|
47334|#821$# What? You have to ask something so obvious? 
#822$# Am I not your friend? Ha ha ha...|
47335|#821$# A friend is one who won't abandon you, even though he is so ashamed of you! 
#822$ Who am I talking about? I can't tell you, I'd be in so much trouble! Ha ha ha...|
47336|#822$ Whoever you think is your friend, is your friend! 
#821$ Friends are as simple as that, why over-think it?|
47341|What do you think about travelling?|
47342|Share your opinions on travelling with me?|
47343|#821$# I love to travel!
#822$# Aside from making new friends, this way I can also try new food.
#823$# Makes me hungry just talking about it! Ha-ha!|
47344|#822$# Are you going on a trip? How marvelous!
#821$# It's dangerous to go alone! Take me with you.|
47345|#821$# Travel? What's to think about? It's basically just going around, eating and drinking. 
#822$# Speaking of which, I remember this little volcano where I once spent the weekend...|
47346|#821$# Why are we talking about it, when we can just go!
#822$# The best way to know what traveling is like is to experience the adventure! 
#823$# Well? What are you waiting for?|
47351|What's special about the Infernal Abyss?|
47352|What do you know about the Infernal Abyss?|
47353|#822$# Hmm... I would think, with you and I being friends, that you would know of it already.
#823$# How can you have forgotten already?|
47354|#821$# To me, the Infernal Abyss is simply a game room, for killing... time.
#822$# For some reason, however, many Envoys of Gaia are going there to test themselves.
#823$# It certainly makes the place more interesting, ha ha!|
47355|#821$# Fine, fine... I'll tell you, but don't tell anyone else! 
#822$# The Infernal Abyss was an idea I had one day while I was bathing.
#823$# Just a little thought, haha!|
47356|#822$# It's satisfying to fight against those challengers.
#821$# I still need to take care of the fallen, though.
#824$# How terribly inconvenient!|
47361|What do you know about Pandemonium?|
47362|What is Pandemonium like?|
47363|#822$# Pandemonium? What makes you think I know anything about that place?
#824$# I am Zaahir of the Infernal Abyss, not Zaahir of Pandemonium!|
47364|#821$# Pandemonium is a place of decay and destruction.
#822$# Numerous demons and monsters live there, from what I've been told.
#824$# Life itself would be a punishment, for you, in Pandemonium.|
47365|#821$# Some people say that there is a region of Pandemonium entirely engulfed in flames.
#822$# It sounds delightful! I would love to visit there someday!|
47366|#821$# Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium are areas unaffected by time.
#822$# Physical rules in these realms are very different than they are here.|
47371|What is the Envoy's Path?|
47372|How should I choose my abilities in the Envoy's Path?|
47373|#821$# As you grow more powerful, you are able to unlock more areas in the Envoy's Path.
#822$# Different paths will give you different abilities that will be useful in battle.|
47374|#821$# If you're not sure where to go, try focusing on one area.
#822$# You are sure to improve if you keep focus on one area.|
47375|#824$# Humans are so troublesome! You have to actually accumulate EXP to grow stronger!
#821$# I would die from boredom, if I had to do the same!|
47376|#821$# You seem so lost, so I'll help you out.
#822$# If you want to be good at PvP, learn skills which decrease your critical damage you take.
#823$# Definitely a life-saver, ha-ha!|
47381|Let's talk about equipment fortification.|
47382|What do you know about equipment fortification?|
47383|#821$# Fortifying equipment is a bold move!
#823$# Powerful equipment attracts attention, and challengers!|
47384|#821$# Equipment fortification can dramatically increase the existing attributes of your gear.
#822$# You can become stronger still when your gear reaches certain fortification levels.
#823$# Such important information - Don't forget it!|
47385|#821$# Disassembling equipment can give you Fragments. 
#822$# You can use these to enhance the rest of your gear.|
47386|#821$# Your fortification failed? No worries!
#823$# Keep at it - eventually you will get what you want!|
47391|What is the ranking system?|
47392|What do you know about the ranking system?|
47393|#821$# Placing well in a ranking list is a great honor for any Envoy of Gaia.
#822$# Not only will you be noticed for your accomplishments, but you'll also be rewarded for your hard work.|
47394|#823$# If there is ever a popularity ranking, I'll definitely be in first place! Ha!|
47395|#821$# Want to place well in a ranking list? You've come to the right person!
#822$# Keep collecting materials from instances, and you'll definitely see yourself up there one day!|
47396|#821$# Keep in mind that the rankings will occasionally reset.
#822$# So, if you don't make the rankings this time around, don't fret!
#823$# There's always next time.|
47401|How hot is your breath?|
47402|How hot can your breath get?|
47403|#821$# Well... I don't know. 
#822$# Why don't you come find out for yourself? 
#821$# Ha-ha, you look so scared! I'm only kidding, of course.|
47404|#823$# Who cares about the exact temperature? Being able to burn enemies to death is enough for me!|
47405|#821$# Hmm... Five or six thousand degrees? No, I think it's seven or eight thousand?  
#822$# Anyway it's around those temperatures! Hot enough, don't you think?|
47406|#822$# Hmmm... I'm not really clear about the exact temperature of my breath. 
#821$# I am certain that there is nothing in this world can withstand my breath!  
#822$# So what do you say, how hot should it be?|
47411|What's the pearl on your tail?|
47412|What's that pearl on your tail?|
47413|#821$# Oh, this little thing?
#822$# It's nothing special. Heh-heh-heh...|
47414|#821$# This is a gift given to me by the Cube of Gaia! 
#822$# It is precious to me...|
47415|#821$# It's a lovely decoration, isn't it? 
#822$# I'm not sure I want to talk about it...|
47416|#821$# I've learned that some things are better as mysteries.  
#822$# Perhaps you'll figure it out one day...|
47421|You look really like the Dragons, are you guys related?|
47422|Your appearance is very similar to the Dragons - are you one of them?|
47423|#822$# Ha ha ha... Foolish mortal, looking alike doesn't mean that we're related!|
47424|#821$# I'm probably more closely related to sprites than I am to dragons...|
47425|#823$# Oh? I don't want to be associated with those greedy good-for-nothings.|
47426|#822$# No worries. I'm no relation to the Dragons.
#821$# I was born of air and fire, not some mundane egg-hatching.|
47431|What's that on your back?|
47432|What's that behind your back?|
47433|#821$# This is my propeller! 
#822$# It looks good, right? Ha ha ha...|
47434|#821$# Oh, this? This is... uh...
#822$# I'll tell you later!|
47435|#822$# Eh? You don't know? 
#821$# Well, it's what it is. No more, no less!|
47436|#821$# This? It helps me to fly. 
#822$# Flying isn't my strong suit, eh-heh...|
47441|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
47442|Tell me some interesting tidbits about Eidolons.|
47443|#821$# Oh! I know something juicy about...someone...
#822$# Now, who was it...? 
#821$# Eh... Wait, let me think, who was it...?|
47444|#822$# Abraxas is a dashing young man with fine skills. 
#821$# But... He's a bit self-centered. Don't pick that up from him.|
47445|#822$# Nalani is very clever and kind - she's a good girl. 
#821$# Too bad she's so shy; to this day, I haven't heard her speak at all!|
47446|#822$# Tsubaki... I've come to a deep understanding of these words, thanks to her.  
#821$# "Better to offend a villain than a woman".  
#822$# When a woman takes revenge, she is far more formidable than a villain.....|
47451|Do you get hurt by your own breath?|
47452|Is your breath useful to you?|
47453|#822$# Hahaha! You amuse me, human. A warrior whose own techniques harmed them would be a chief among fools!|
47454|#821$#It is a useful attack precisely because it hurts others but is harmless to me.|
47455|#822$#Ghahaha...it is to me as your saliva is to you.
#821$#Were it harmful, I would have burned my face off long ago.|
47456|#822$#Have you happened to look at the rest of my body? Fire is what I do, young one.|
47461|What's the purpose of the horns on your head?|
47462|How do you use the horns on your head?|
47463|#821$#Mmm... Yes, they are a symbol of my virility!
#822$#Gyahaha...you really will believe about anything an Eidolon tells you.
#821$#Perhaps later I'll explain their cultural significance.|
47464|#822$#My horns are not just dashing! 
#821$#They make for a gruesome headbutt none would care to be on the receiving end of.
#822$#That's how you get a-head in life!|
47465|#821$#My horns can sense heat. Even in total darkness, they help me pinpoint an enemy's location.|
47466|#822$#Their purpose? Do you question the purpose of your own hair? It is better to simply see me in action.|
47471|Is your body temperature always so high?|
47472|Does your body temperature ever drop?|
47473|#822$#A  high body temperature is good - it means I am alive and well.|
47474|#822$#A high temperature is healthy for me.
#821$#If my temperature makes a sudden drop, my death may be close at hand.
#822$#On that day, I insist that you give me a spectacular funeral pyre.|
47475|#821$#Am I...too hot for you?
#822$#Alas, I can do little about my hotness.|
47476|#822$#Too hot already? You'd better grab some water, because things have only just begun to heat up!|
47481|What's the purpose of your tail?|
47482|What is your tail for?|
47483|#821$#Functional purpose aside, it makes me look quite dignified.
#822$#I am a handsome devil, am I not?|
47484|#821$#As you've seen, my weight is centered in my upper body.
#822$#My tail is there to provide balance, allowing me to move this heft with ease.|
47485|#821$#It's surprisingly long, which means I can crack it into enemies.
#822$#There have been times, however. Times. In which I may have...hit myself...|
47486|#821$#It is a back scratcher unequaled in this realm or the spirit realm.
#822$#Wait...you did not actually fall for my jape, did you?|
47491|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
47492|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
47493|#821$#What is there to worry about?
#822$#Wherever I go, I shall live well.|
47494|#822$#There are many things the future may hold; many desires.
#821$#Tomorrow will worry about itself; I will focus on the present.|
47495|#821$#Hah! As though you would cast me away, with all the trouble you went through to make a pact with me.
#822$#We are here together like this because we are conquerors, both of us.|
47496|#822$#Do not worry yourself for my sake. I have survived eons.
#821$#I live well, and if not, I conquer until I do.|
47601|How do you like to spend your leisure time?|
47602|How do you usually kill time?|
47603|#821$# I am the best at tracking and hunting.
#822$# My greatest hope is to defeat the creatures of evil around the world and bring peace to all.|
47604|#822$# As a knight, helping those in need is my duty.
#821$# I constantly train myself by fighting against evil.|
47605|#821$# When I have time to spare, I often travel to different cities and towns.
#823$# Future trips will be more interesting with you by my side!|
47606|#821$# My only goal is to serve you as a dutiful knight.
#823$# If there are any leisure activities that you like, I'd be happy to try them with you.|
47611|Have you ever joined any clubs?|
47612|Do you participate in any groups?|
47613|#822$# Once I was the leader of the Knights Templar.
#823$# All of our members excelled in their duties and had a strong sense of justice!|
47614|#822$# For a long time, I led the undefeatable Knights on many campaigns.
#821$# Countless evil creatures fell under our swords...|
47615|#822$# Hmm... sometimes I miss the days when I fought side by side with my fellow warriors...|
47616|#822$# Every time I join arms with you in battle, I'm reminded of those days.
#821$# There's nothing more reassuring than the mutual trust of letting someone watch your back.|
47621|Something incredible|
47622|A fantastic story.|
47623|#822$# It is said that there is a mysterious lake in a faraway land.
#821$# I've heard that someone once saw a woman's graceful arm emerge from the surface of the water.
#824$# Don't you think that's incredible?|
47624|#822$# Once I heard that there's a place in Terra called 'The Pure Land'.
#821$# Living creatures have to abandon everything to enter and obtain eternal happiness. 
#823$# What an amazing place... I'd like to see it with my own eyes.|
47625|#821$# It's rumored that beautiful fairies live in a lake surrounded by marshland and mysterious forests.
#822$# The fairies are gifted with magic and protect a legendary sacred sword.|
47626|#822$# As an Envoy of Gaia, you must have traveled to many different places, right?
#823$# Tell me something interesting in return, then.|
47631|How would you define justice?|
47632|What is justice to you?|
47633|#821$# Justice is chivalry, and chivalry is justice.
#823$# Aid for the helpless, mercy for the unfortunate - that's justice.|
47634|#824$# Justice means treating everyone equally.
#821$# Justice means helping the disadvantaged fulfill their true potential.|
47635|#822$# Justice means keeping an upright, uncorruptable heart.
#821$# Sticking to one's principles no matter what - that's the true meaning of justice.|
47636|#822$# Justice means promoting the good and punishing the bad. 
#823$# Treating everyone without discrimination is the highest form of justice - something we can all aspire to.|
47641|What should I do when facing strong enemies?|
47642|How do I deal with powerful enemies?|
47643|#821$# One should show one's true colors in battle, and fight the fight of the brave.
#823$# Only in doing so can one fulfill the honorable destiny of a knight!|
47644|#821$# Even the strongest of enemies have their weaknesses.
#823$# All you need to do is find the right strategy to beat them.|
47645|#822$# If you are pitted against enemies that exceed your ability, reply with courage and determination.
#823$# The victory always favors those who stick it out to the very end.|
47646|#822$# Retreating is also an option, when faced with overwhelming enemies.|
47651|Have you ever heard of Ventos Prairie?|
47652|What's Ventos Prairie like?|
47653|#821$# Ventos Prairie is a perfect place for hunting.
#823$# Its open fields and flat terrain can be crossed at a swift gallop.|
47654|#821$# Apart from the Makars, who have been living there for generations,
#822$# a group of cunning Gnomes have also made it their home.|
47655|#822$# Not far from the Makar Tribe, there's a network of underground caves.
#821$# There lies the flame-drenched Infernal Abyss created by Zaahir.|
47656|#822$# Ventos Prairie... it's a beautiful place that reminds me of my homeland...|
47661|What do you think of Terra?|
47662|What can you tell me about Terra?|
47663|#821$# Not everyone in Terra is kind... but there are a great number of helpful people.
#822$# Humans as a whole aren't such a bad lot.|
47664|#821$# There're a lot of places in Terra that haven't been discovered by humans.
#821$# Those places will be the key to unlocking the secret of the Cube of Gaia.|
47665|#821$# Because of the shackles of time placed on Terra by the Cube of Gaia,
#822$# all living things have to face the ravages of illness and death.
#823$# But it's precisely because of mortality that numerous cultures can coexist in Terra.|
47666|#822$# Terra was created by the Cube of Gaia.
#821$# Aside from Terra, there are also the Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium.|
47671|What's the Mirabelle Group?|
47672|Have you heard of the Mirabelle Group?|
47673|#822$# The Mirabelle Group was founded a group of just and charitable explorers.
#821$# Their mission is to help anyone in need.
#823$# As a group, they share much in common with my code of chilvary.|
47674|#821$# The Mirabelle Group has branches in every village.
#822$# You can find out who is in need simply by looking at the Mirabelle Bulletin Board.|
47675|#821$# You can accept all kinds of quests from Mirrabelle Bulletin Board.
#823$# A splendid reward is given to those who help complete these quests.|
47676|#822$# The Mirabelle Group seems to be a very resourceful organization.
#821$# Judging from the number of quests they post every day, they must also have a huge membership.|
47681|Tell me about Guild Instances.|
47682|What do you know about Guild Instances?|
47683|#821$# As more and more evil creatures began to appear on Midgard,
#822$# The Church issued an order that all guilds take up arms.|
47684|#822$# Your Guild must reach Level 4 to participate in Guild Instances.
#821$# You can register through the Guild Interface.|
47685|#821$# Personal contribution points can be accumulated by completing Guild Instances.
#823$# Rare loot can be obtained by those who accumulate enough contribution points.|
47686|#821$# More and more Guilds are participating Guild Instances.
#822$# You should consider joining a bigger Guild. The more members there are, the easier it is.|
47691|What's the Sky Tower like?|
47692|Have you heard of the Sky Tower?|
47693|#821$# The Sky Tower is the central landmark of Navea.
#822$# It is said that all kinds of rare treasures are stored at the top of the tower.|
47694|#822$# The Holy Spirit Potion is the first thing people think of when the Sky Tower is mentioned.
#821$# Rumor has it that the Holy Spirit Potion cures all illnesses; some people even say that it can bring the dead back to life.|
47695|#821$# The Sky Tower is under the strict control of the church. It is crawling with legends and secrets. 
#822$# What on earth could it have been built for? It's such a fascinating place!|
47696|#821$# The entrance to Sky Tower is normally sealed by an impenetrable magic seal.
#822$# The seal will only be removed at a preordained time, allowing the selected Envoy of Gaia to enter.|
47701|What is chivalry?|
47702|How does one become a real knight?|
47703|#822$# Self-discipline is the key premise of becoming a knight.
#821$# A knight does not fight without a meaningful reason.|
47704|#821$# Knights are honorable and chivalrous toward ladies.
#822$# Learning how to help a lady in distress resolve her problem is the very first lesson for every knight.|
47705|#821$# True chivalry cannot be defined in a few words.
#822$# A dutiful knight must watch his behavior and live by his word.|
47706|#822$# Nothing can keep you from becoming a knight. All you need is a merciful heart.|
47711|Did you receive any guidance from others?|
47712|How did you become so wise?|
47713|#824$# Heh, heh... I was once reckless and impulsive, too.
#822$# Fortunately, I received many lessons from an elder, who was well-versed in magic.|
47714|#821$# The one who taught me the real meaning of chivalry was an elder who treated me like a family member.
#822$# He saved me from danger many times.|
47715|#824$# Sigh... I wonder where he is now...|
47716|#821$# My teacher was a very famous old mage.
#822$# It's said he had demon blood coursing through his veins, allowing him to use all kinds of magic.|
47721|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
47722|What makes your weapon special?|
47723|#821$# My weapon is called Sword in the Stone. It represents justice.|
47724|#821$# Sword in the Stone can make short work of any evil or obstacles in my way.
#824$# If, however, it is not used for just ends, the sword will immediately break in two.|
47725|#822$# The Sword in the Stone was not originally of this world.
#821$# It only arrived here after the Cube of Gaia created Terra.|
47726|#821$# The Sword in the Stone was once firmly inlaid in the Cube of Gaia.
#823$# When I extracted it from the cube, I gave it its name.|
47731|Do you normally sit down to rest?|
47732|Do you sit down when you're tired?|
47733|#822$# As a knight, it's essential to be courteous.
#821$# So I always stand, even when I'm exhausted.|
47734|#822$# A knight must be vigiliant.
#821$# I even sleep standing up!|
47735|#822$# I don't need to sit down to rest.
#823$# The strength of my resolve in protecting my companions is enough to keep me upright!|
47736|#822$# A knight like me doesn't need to sit down to take a break.
#822$# You've been taking longer breaks recently... are you a bit overworked?|
47741|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
47742|I want to hear gossip about the other Eidolons.|
47743|#822$# I heard that Kusanagi's true form is a sword.
#824$# Perhaps... perhaps she could communicate with the Sword in the Stone...|
47744|#821$# Serif is the one I like the best. He understands the true meaning of chivalry.
#822$# He keeps a respectful distance from both Endora and Merrilee.|
47745|#821$# Bealdor's Claymore emits a pale light with even the gentlest of movements. 
#822$# Well... my Sword in the Stone will have to concede to him... on this point...|
47746|#822$# Nazrudin is modest and erudite.
#824$# He never fails to remind me of my own teacher.|
47751|Are there any wishes you would like to see fulfilled?|
47752|What do you desire most?|
47753|#822$# My wish is to fulfill your wishes.
#823$# My wish is to serve you well as a knight possibly can.|
47754|#821$# I've heard that many places in Terra are still suffering from the invasion of monsters.
#822$# One of my wishes is to eliminate those evil creatures so people can live in peace.|
47755|#822$# It is said that an artifact called Holy Grail exists in Terra. Supposedly, it can bring peace and happiness to the world...
#824$# If I could find it... I'd be able to help even more people.|
47756|#823$# My wish is to help as many people as I can.|
47761|Do you have friends you really trust?|
47762|Who do you trust the most?|
47763|#821$# You, of course!
#823$# I am proud to fight by your side!|
47764|#821$# Once I was part of a group of reliable knights.
#822$# Even today, I fondly recall the days we spent traveling the world, fighting for justice.|
47765|#821$# Once upon a time, I was one of the knights of justice.
#823$# We endured countless trials together.|
47766|#823$# A knight learns to place all his trust in his friends!
#821$# He who hopes to find true friendship must learn to place his trust in others.|
47771|Are you really a lord of the Round Table?|
47772|Are you really a lord?|
47773|#822$# Heh, heh... my comrades-in-arms call me "lord".|
47774|#821$# Indeed, all the members of the my group used to call me "lord" when I was their commander...
#824$# The title stuck, and many call me "lord" to this day.|
47775|#822$# There was an interesting story about the Sword in the Stone:
#821$# "The one who can extract it from Cube of Gaia will become a lord."
#824$# The title stuck, and many call me "lord" to this day.|
47776|#822$# Maybe I was once a lord who led many knights.
#823$# However, now I am just a knight who wants to fulfill your wishes.|
47781|How do you train yourself normally?|
47782|What's your training regimen?|
47783|#822$# Apart from practicing my sword technique, I often look for those who need my aid.
#821$# Implementing chivalry in every part of one's life is the best way to train oneself.|
47784|#821$# Chivalry is a good training method unto itself.
#822$# Doing everything, every day, with a merciful and righteous heart: that is how I train myself.|
47785|#822$# The path of justice is not easy.
#823$# However, as a knight, every step I took was a part of my training.|
47786|#822$# Why, are you also interested in self-improvement?
#823$# How about a practice battle with me?|
47791|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
47792|What's your plan after we part ways?|
47793|#824$# If one day we must separate... I'll continue on my path of justice.|
47794|#822$# It's always fine if you want to select another path.
#823$# All the adventures we've experienced won't be forgotten.|
47795|#822$# A knight doesn't feel bad about parting ways.
#823$# It's a necessary step for our eventual reunion!|
47796|#823$# I'll travel around and see everything the world has to offer.|
47901|Is there any food that you especially like?|
47902|What's your favorite food?|
47903|#822$#Mmm... I'll never say no to inarizushi and fried tofu. Let's have some!|
47904|#821$#And what better way to wash down my inarizushi than with a hot bottle of sake?|
47905|#821$#Well, you look like a pretty tasty meal yourself!
#823$#Oh dear, did you just flinch? Haha, you're so precious.|
47906|#822$#If it's something you like, I can learn to like it too.|
47911|What's your favorite season?|
47912|Do like any particular season most?|
47913|#822$#I'll tell you what I don't like - summers!
#824$#I get so hot and sweaty, I just want to stay indoors all day.|
47914|#821$#Winter is my favorite.
#822$#On a cold winter day, I can snuggle up in a blanket with a bottle of boo- er, hot chocolate!|
47915|#822$#Well, as long as it's not summer, I enjoy all the seasons.
#821$#But being sweaty is really the worst.|
47916|#821$#Autumn has a certain elegance to it.
#822$#Sometimes, it just seems like food tastes more flavorful in the fall.|
47921|Do you like animals?|
47922|What do you think of animals?|
47923|#821$#What could be more adorable than soft, furry fox kits?|
47924|#824$#Lamest animal? Dogs, of course. The way they fawn over humans; it's so embarrassing.
#824$#It's hard to believe we noble foxes are distantly related to those canines!|
47925|#821$#I like foxes the most...but I may be biased.
#822$#What about you? Are you a fox fancier like me?|
47926|#821$#Little fox kits are just the cutest!
#822$#Their little soft, furry bodies all curled up in a den...it almost makes me want to have kits of my own someday.|
47931|What do I do when I run into a strong enemy?|
47932|Tell me the best strategy for facing a powerful enemy.|
47933|#822$#You will bravely face the enemy, while I go hide behind a rock!
#823$#Oh, c'mon, I was only kidding!
#821$#I'd never leave you behind, you know.|
47934|#824$#Hmm...that's a toughie.
#822$#What do you think? Maybe a dash of trickery?|
47935|#822$#I'm all in favor of a two-pronged attack.
#821$#You hit 'em in the front, and I'll zap 'em from behind!|
47936|#822$#What if I swooned during the fight? Would you dash in bravely to save me?|
47941|What kind of person do you like?|
47942|What kind of person would you want to date?|
47943|#823$# Oh gosh, way to ask something embarrassing! I thought you already knew.
#821$#The kind of person I like is...well...someone like you.|
47944|#823$#Ohmygosh. My mind just went blank.|
47945|#824$#Why would you ask something like that?
#824$#Don't you realize? You're the one I like most.|
47946|#821$#My ideal date would have awesome skills, good looks, and most importantly, they can't let me go hungry.
#822$#Haha, you say I'm being too picky and I'll never find anyone like that?
#821$#Don't YOU meet all those conditions?|
47951|What's special about Port Skandia?|
47952|Can you tell me about Port Skandia?|
47953|#822$#Eh? Isn't Port Skandia your hometown? What would I know about it that you don't?
#824$#Are you teasing me again?|
47954|#822$#It seems like a quiet little town, but Port Skandia must be a nice place.
#821$#You grew up there, and you turned into a pretty good human, if I say so myself.|
47955|#822$#There's a beautiful lighthouse in Port Skandia where you can look far off toward the horizon.
#823$#Next time we're there, let's go see the sun setting on the sea.|
47956|#822$#How long has it been since you've been back to Port Skandia, anyway?
#821$#Maybe you should go back more often, if you have to ask Eidolons what's happening in your hometown.|
47961|What do you know of the Aura Kingdom?|
47962|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
47963|#822$#The spirits who come from there say the Aura Kingdom's beauty far outshines the most picturesque vistas of Terra.
#821$#It's known as a realm filled with unending joy and peace.|
47964|#823$#I've never been there myself, but I like to think  you can take a little bit of heaven with you by keeping a positive attitude.|
47965|#821$#They say time functions much differently in the Aura Kingdom. It passes very slowly there, and nothing ages.
#822$#It sounds pretty profound, like contemplating my rock garden!|
47966|#821$#Sometimes Uzuriel or Abraxas will tell me about the Aura Kingdom, but I've never been there before.
#822$#If you go there someday, be sure to take me with you!|
47971|I want to know more about Masteries.|
47972|What do you know about Mastery?|
47973|#822$#Masteries strengthen skills you have, or give them additional abilities.
#821$#They're like the frosting on the cake of battle techniques!|
47974|#822$#In Navea, there's a group who can teach Envoys the secrets of Mastery.
#821$#If you can collect these special tokens, you can exchange them for advanced training in your Masteries.|
47975|#822$#Mastery? Boooo-ring. Let's talk about how I can break into the Terran scene as an idol singer!|
47976|#822$#I've heard that only those people with an excellent command of the original skill can really grasp the key to Mastery.
#821$#You're a good fighter, right? It shouldn't be any problem for you.|
47981|Is it true that every region has unique culinary specialties?|
47982|I heard that every region has its own famous dish.|
47983|#822$#We're talking about food now? Are you hungry?|
47984|#821$#If you DO happen to take a world food tour, I'm the #1 choice to accompany you, right?
#824$#I have hands that can hold tableware, and not every Eidolon can say that!|
47985|#821$#If you're looking to try good regional cuisine, I recommend going to the street vendors.
#823$#Or, I could prepare them for you personally! That kitchen fire last time was just a freak incident.|
47986|#822$#Can we go somewhere where the regional specialties include inarizushi and fried tofu?
#821$#Next time we're sightseeing, I'll be on the lookout for those!|
47991|How can we find the magic in everyday life?|
47992|What's interesting out there in the world?|
47993|#824$#A...are you saying every day with me isn't magical?
#824$#*sniff* I've tried so hard...|
47994|#821$#I have no doubt that we'll make something interesting happen wherever we turn up!|
47995|#822$#If we pay attention to others and help them out, the richness of their lives will enrich ours.
#821$#Also, y'know, when we help people, that might be a quest! And quest-givers tend to give rewards.|
47996|#821$#It's really interesting to listen to people's conversations. You can feel like you're experiencing a little sliver of their lives.
#822$#Of course, if you dig up something really scandalous, be sure to tell me first!|
48001|Why do you like inarizushi and fried tofu so much?|
48002|Are inarizushi and fried tofu really that delicious?|
48003|#821$#Y'know...I don't know why. 
#822$#As far back as I can remember, I've always thought they were delicious.|
48004|#822$#Don't you like inarizushi and fried tofu?
#824$#If you don't like them...well, there's no accounting for taste. You can eat your "ham bargars" and I'll have my tofu.|
48005|#822$#I think it's because people often made offerings of inarizushi and fried tofu to me when I was just a guardian spirit.
#821$#I guess I got so used to eating them that now they're like my comfort food.|
48006|#822$#They really are delicious - I'll make you try them one of these days.
#821$#...now that you got me talking about them, I'm totally hungry.|
48011|Your ears are so cute...can I touch them?|
48012|Can I...touch your ears?|
48013|#822$# I've never allowed anyone to touch my ears! 
#821$#It's...it's only because you're my Envoy that I'll allow you to touch them.|
48014|#822$#W-what kind of question is that?!
#823$#Right here? Right out in the open? It'd be indecent.|
48015|#821$#Normally I'd shoot down anyone who asked, but for you...I guess I'll acquiesce - but just this once!|
48016|#821$#If you really have your heart set on touching them, I suppose I'll allow it.
#822$#But you can only touch them for a moment! Any longer and I'd start to feel embarrassed.|
48021|Do you know Tsubaki?|
48022|I heard that you're related to Tsubaki.|
48023|#821$#Hmm? Who's that?
#822$#I have no idea what you're talking about. *wink*|
48024|#821$#Ohhhhh, Tsubaki?
#822$#Never heard of her... tee-hee...|
48025|#822$#Is she a new friend of yours?
#821$#She sounds adorable...maybe second to me.|
48026|#821$#Welllll, the name sounds familiar, now that I think about it.
#822$#I think I've heard of her somewhere before, but I just don't know where. *snicker*|
48031|What's your real fox self like?|
48032|You're really a nine-tailed fox, right?|
48033|#822$#Why the sudden interest in foxes?
#821$#Don't you like the way I look now?|
48034|#822$#To tell the truth, no one alive has seen my fox form.
#821$#Those who did kinda got turned into a little snack, you dig?|
48035|#822$#The number of tails a fox has represents the amount of magical power they possess. I have nine tails, and you've seen my magic!|
48036|#822$#My real form is an enormous, golden nine-tailed fox.
#821$#Hee hee...is it hard to think of me like that?|
48041|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
48042|Dish me up some real dirt on the other Eidolons!|
48043|#821$#I've heard Yarnaros can fly faster than the speed of sound.
#822$#If he yells something as he flies, does it only catch up to him later?|
48044|#822$#Sigrun is really cool.
#821$#Even on hot days, she's never without her full suit of armor. That's professional dedication right there!|
48045|#822$#Aelius has many talents you wouldn't expect someone like him to have - like music!
#822$#But he always gives me a weird vibe, covering up his face like that. What has he got to hide?|
48046|#821$#Bel-Chandra does a beautiful, mesmerizing dance that totally locks your eyes on her.
#822$#Maybe I should get some tips from her, then try out my new dance on you.|
48051|Is nine tails the most a fox can have?|
48052|How many tails can you get?|
48053|#822$#Oh, looks like you've done your homework.
#821$#I got all nine of my tails before I became an Eidolon.|
48054|#822$#You reeeeally want to know? Well...I'm not gonna tell you.
#821$#We ladies have to keep a few good secrets, right?|
48055|#822$#Mmm, that's right.
#821$#Care to guess how many tails I have?
#822$#This is to see if you've been paying attention!|
48056|#822$#Can a fox wear a fake tail? You can take a guess...
#821$#...but if you're wrong, I'll zap you!|
48061|Where's your tail, anyway?|
48062|Why can't I see your tail?|
48063|#821$#Teehee... I've hidden it away.
#823$#If I have it out, I feel like everyone just stares at my butt.|
48064|#822$#Oh? You want to see my tail?
#821$#Well...I can't let you see it right now. It might count as flashing if I showed you in public.|
48065|#821$#Only smart people can see my tail, mwahahaha!|
48066|#822$#A fox never exposes their tail when transformed.
#821$#That would totally give us away when we play pranks on others.|
48071|Isn't it hard to walk in such high heels?|
48072|Do you get tired walking with those high heels?|
48073|#822$#No one said being a fashionable fighter is easy, you know.
#821$#But if you think I look nice, I'll take the compliment.|
48074|#822$#Haha! You should pay a little more attention.
#821$#Most of the time, I'm floating, so it doesn't bother me at all.|
48075|#821$#It doesn't tire me out at all, but it's sweet of you to be concerned.|
48076|#821$#Aren't these shoes great? They're my favorite pair.|
48081|What's the blue jewel around your neck?|
48082|Can you tell me about that blue ornament you wear?|
48083|#822$#I use this crystal to store energy. It helps me manifest easily in your realm.|
48084|#823$#Ahem...my eyes are up here.|
48085|#822$#This crystal was a gift from the Cube of Gaia. All Eidolons have something like this. Do you want a matching pendant?|
48086|#822$#Why don't you make a guess as to what it does?
#821$#If you're right, I'll give you a reward.|
48091|Have you thought about your life when we're no longer together?|
48092|What do you plan to do after we part ways?|
48093|#822$#When we go our separate ways?
#824$#*sniff* Are...are you tired of me?|
48094|#822$#Part ways? What are you talking about?
#824$#Haven't I been your #1, best, prettiest Eidolon?|
48095|#824$#Until the day you say you don't want me, I won't leave your side.
#821$#But that day will never come, right?|
48096|#822$#I don't want to talk about that. Just thinking about it hits me with the depression stick.|
48201|Is there anything that's troubling you?|
48202|What gives you the biggest headache?|
48203|#821$# Troubling stuff? Why would someone like me have any troubles? 
#821$# But if I were to be truthful...
#823$# It would be that I'm too popular with women, which can cause real trouble, ha ha.|
48204|#824$# Sigh, why is a cat like me so perfect? 
#822$# You mere mortals are destined to indulge yourselves in my incomparable charm forever. 
#823$# This can be a real bother...|
48205|#821$# I think you might not be able to understand...
#824$# However, when you are always invincible, in battle or love, the lack of challenge can be pretty boring!|
48206|#822$# Heh heh, don't lie to yourself, your eyes have betrayed you...
#824$# One more captive, who can't resist my charm... Is being beautiful a mistake, too?|
48211|What is your favorite food?|
48212|What do you normally eat?|
48213|#822$# Hey, I'm not a tame kitty... Don't ever think of patronizing me with things like grilled fish.|
48214|#822$# I'm a cat who loves his meat, I think you can easily see that. 
#823$# What I like, of course, is to take huge bites of meat in luxury!|
48215|#821$# I only eat the freshest, thick cut steaks, with no seasoning at all. 
#822$# They are tightly wrapped in coals of high temperature, which completely char the surfaces in an instant, locking the juices.   
#823$# When you finally tear it open with your mouth, it's like conquering virgin territories! Such a joyous feeling!|
48216|#822$# A player as sentimental and affectionate as me certainly can't go without romance for a day. 
#823$# Encounters with beautiful women, all around the world, are the sweetest food!|
48221|What do you think honor is?|
48222|What does honor mean to you?|
48223|#821$# Honor is the most important thing in the world; it's a truth that you should protect with your life. 
#824$# That's because if a person doesn't protect his honor, he certainly can't be trusted to take responsibility for himself, either.|
48224|#822$# Honor? It's an invisible medal that you put on your coat. 
#823$# You can only get other people to worship you if you have these medals, just like me!|
48225|#822$# Honor is a necessary weapon for realizing your own ambitions; 
#821$# it can turn your enemies into friends, and your disadvantaged position into an advantageous one!|
48226|#821$# It's like how birds cherish their feathers and how beasts cherish their fur. 
#823$# For a cat like me, honor is my most magnificent coat - Its brilliance must be maintained at all times!|
48231|What do you think is admirable?|
48232|What kind of people are considered admirable?|
48233|#823$# Hehe, what are you trying to hint at? A cat like me will definitely take your compliments with pleasure!|
48234|#821$# An obstinate adherence to the good in your goals, as well as being forthright and generous in how you handle things - these are the basic criteria to being admirable. 
#823$# However, I don't think anyone in this world can be as admirable as me, haha.|
48235|#822$# People who are really admirable do not need any tricks to embellish themselves; 
#823$# they can mesmerize people just by breathing. Just like me!|
48236|#822$# What is admirable? Heh heh, isn't this a very simple question? 
#823$# As long as you continue to stay by my side, you will very quickly understand the real meaning of "admirable."|
48241|What type of girls are you into?|
48242|What type of girl are you attracted to?|
48243|#823$# A woman who's pretty like a flower and passionate like fire is my natural favorite, hehe!|
48244|#822$# Haughty, rich young ladies who dare to shower me with affection, like I'm a kitten are not bad either; 
#823$# they are like flowers that bloom generously on the highlands - valuable conquests!|
48245|#821$# Graceful beauties who have both intellect and beauty are most elusive. 
#823$# Having a passionate battle of wits with them is... Heh heh, just thinking of it get me excited.|
48246|#822$# As long as you display confidence and respect yourself, you'll be show yourself at your most attractive. 
#823$# Women that match these criteria are the most charming, in my heart.|
48251|What's special about Candeo Marsh?|
48252|Can you give a brief introduction Candeo Marsh?|
48253|#822$# There's a vicious Bandit Gang formed by Werewolves in Candeo Marsh; 
#823$# if I were in charge of that place, I'll definitely not let them wreck havoc!|
48254|#821$# It's said that a tribe of Sarpa has been living in the underground waterways of Candeo Marsh since ancient times. 
#822$# Even though I don't really like damp and slippery water banks, I do hope to see these snake-people.|
48255|#821$# Even though there have been rumors about terrifying blood-sucking creatures lurking in Candeo Marsh, 
#824$# a cat like me doesn't believe in such superstition, there must be some secret behind this.|
48256|#821$# Candeo Marsh is a dark and damp place; I don't really want to go near there.|
48261|Please tell me about monsters.|
48262|What should I take note of, when fighting monsters.|
48263|#822$# When you are surrounded by difficult monsters, escape as fast as you can; they'll give up as long as you've gotten a certain distance away from them. 
#821$# Of course, a cat like me would never run away, ha ha.|
48264|#821$# Some monsters are very good at camouflage, so open your eyes wide, and be careful when you are walking about in the wilderness.|
48265|#821$# Do not be too hasty to attack monsters upon first meeting. 
#822$# You should click and select the Monster Info Interface first, to get an idea of your opponent's skills and its monster drops, to get the upper hand.|
48266|#821$# The habits of monsters are ever-changing, you'll never be able to predict their abilities. 
#822$# Even if some monsters look very similar, they might still have completely different characteristics.|
48271|I'd like to know about casting and forging.|
48272|How can I forge and cast Enchanted Equipment.|
48273|#821$# Heh heh, forging and casting is the best way that mere mortals can obtain Enchanted Equipment. 
#823$# As long as you persist in your effort, you'll be able to make the highest quality equipment!|
48274|#822$# Heh heh, let me divulge an absolutely critical piece of information to you: 
#823$# the higher the quality of the materials you use to cast, the higher the possibility of getting the best results!|
48275|#821$# As long as you've learnt the formula, you can then look for blacksmiths of Navea to forge and cast.
#822$# Equipment that's cast and forged is very useful!|
48276|#822$# The army under me consists of over ten thousand people, and I have hundreds of blacksmiths under me, too. 
#824$# However, none of them has workmanship that's comparable to Analisa of the Templars...|
48281|I would like to know about allocating character points.|
48282|Give me some tips on character point allocation.|
48283|#822$# Character points can be divided into attack and defense points, and will increase as you advance in level. 
#821$# As long as you've opened the Character Info Interface, you'll be able to allocate the points according to your preferences.|
48284|#821$# Certain attributes have an upper limit; for example, the upper limit of speed attribute is 50%. 
#822$# Therefore, please verify your equipment and skills bonus carefully first before allocating points. 
#823$# Otherwise, don't blame me for not having reminded you, ha ha.|
48285|#821$# Character point allocation will greatly affect your fighting ability, therefore you have to allocate carefully, before a battle.|
48286|#821$# Heh heh, if I were to help you in your allocation, I'll definitely allocate all of them to HP. 
#824$# Otherwise, how would you be able to fight enemies, considering what a weak constitution you have.|
48291|What's the function of the Community System?|
48292|I wanna know tips about the Community System.|
48293|#822$# Heh heh, you can set lots of information on your Personal Profile, including your interests and hobbies. 
#821$# Go try to share it with your good friends.|
48294|#821$# You can get loyalty points after greeting good friends online everyday, 
#821$# and exchange them for items in the Item Mall when you've accumulated enough of them - it's killing two birds with one stone. Ha ha.|
48295|#821$# You can speedily connect with your good friends, or form parties, though the Community System.
#824$# I don't want to admit this, but even my army isn't able to exchange information so speedily...|
48296|#823$# Get to know more friends during your journey. I think that will definitely be of help to you.|
48301|What's the demeanor of a gentleman?|
48302|How do I become a gentleman?|
48303|#821$# You must treat a lady with impeccable manners and look your best, 
#823$# in order to have the bearing that a qualified gentleman should have.|
48304|#822$# You don't just speak well, to have a gentleman's demeanor, 
#821$# you must also put words into action by always treating the lady with respect, just as I do.|
48305|#821$# To be a true gentleman, one must be cultured and filled with knowledge; 
#823$# of course, if he has excellent combat abilities - like me - that will be even more perfect.|
48306|#821$# To become a gentleman, one must be exposed to art and culture for a long period of time; it's not something that you can do overnight.|
48311|Can I touch your tail?|
48312|Your tail looks like it would be nice to touch.|
48313|#823$# Are you kidding me? I'm a great cat, why would I let you touch my tail?|
48314|#823$# I never let anyone touch my tail! 
#824$# Are you taking me for a house cat?|
48315|#821$# I've only let a cute young lady touchd my tail before; 
#824$# hers was such an innocent and naive request - how could I bear to reject her?|
48316|#822$# What a bold and rude request! 
#823$# How dare you ask a cat like me such a question? You've got to prepare yourself for this!|
48321|How did you get your alias?|
48322|Why does everyone call you Emperor?|
48323|#821$# I got my alias, "Emperor," naturally, due to the army of cats that I command, of course. 
#823$# As everyone is in awe of my capability, they gave me this title, ha ha.|
48324|#821$# The title "Emperor" is used for me, by people that I'm not familiar with.  
#822$# Only people that I really trust can call me by my name. Of course, that includes you.|
48325|#821$# When you have superior capabilities, this world will of course submit to you in awe. 
#822$# They do that, and give you a title, to remind themselves that this person is extraordinary. 
#823$# In this way, these people put their egos aside, and follow your commands.|
48326|#823$# My alias, "Emperor," is certainly the best title that I've won with my glorious victories!|
48331|Is there any secret to wooing the opposite sex?|
48332|Can you teach me how to woo the opposite sex?|
48333|#823$# The secret to wooing the opposite sex? Haha, I think you've got your emphasis wrong. 
#821$# The emphasis should always be on whether you're a person of value, and that will attract the other person.|
48334|#823$# You've found the right person to ask this, I'm an expert in this area. 
#821$# Try to cater to the other's likes. Start with the topics that the other person is interested in, so as to close up the gap between you and them.|
48335|#824$# Don't be discouraged if the other person doesn't want you, or do something to hurt the other person. 
#821$# Be generous, mature and face it with a smile; being friends is a great option too, isn't it?|
48336|#822$# Even though I'm suave and romantic, I'm very serious when it comes to women. 
#821$# As long as you're sincere, the other person will slowly come to appreciate your sincerity.|
48341|I wanna know some gossip of other Eidolons.|
48342|Tell me some interesting tidbits about the Eidolons.|
48343|#821$# Gigas is a warrior with mighty strength. Word has it that he once fulfilled twelve difficult quests. 
#823$# However, I'll put him under my control one day and take him in my army, ha ha.|
48344|#822$# Hmmph, according to what I observe, Uzuiel is a deeply shrewd Eidolon. 
#821$# Also... she seems to be always covering something with her behavior....   
#823$# She was never just a simple nobody in the past, so you gotta beware of her!|
48345|#821$# Quelkulan is an ally who's good at both attack and defense; he can hurt and save people with his venom. 
#824$# It's a pity that he's rather eccentric, so a generous and gracious cat like me can't really get along with him.|
48346|#823$# Hahaha! Talking about Bahadur makes me want to fight so much! 
#822$# The underground army that he leads is rather secretive - they've never confronted me directly. 
#823$# If there's a chance... No, I must have 300 rounds of battle with him, before I'd call it quits!|
48351|Have you lost a battle before?|
48352|Do you have much experience with losing?|
48353|#822$# How could a warrior like me lose a battle? Even if I retreat, it's just a tactical trick!|
48354|#824$# Looks like you don't really know how the world works, let me share with you famous words. 
#822$# I come, I see, I conquer. 
#823$# Bear this in mind; this is my only and constant way, ha ha ha.|
48355|#823$# Ha ha ha, I'll never fight a losing battle!|
48356|#822$# When I was on an expedition to a kingdom in the desert once, I met a...
#824$# No... That wasn't a failure! It's just that I have not conquered... Yet!|
48361|Will you be happy if I rub your belly?|
48362|Do you like to be caressed on the belly?|
48363|#822$# Shut, shut up... Stop saying that...
#824$# Just mentioning the word "belly" makes me itch all over!|
48364|#823$# Oh my god, please do not mention the word "belly" again, it makes me itch all over!|
48365|#824$# Where do you get such a horrifying idea?! Is caressing a furry belly so pleasurable?|
48366|#822$# Please do not derive pleasure from another's pain...
#824$# I'm not a kitten, so please do not think of touching my stomach all day long...|
48371|Who's your biggest enemy?|
48372|Who's your strongest foe?|
48373|#822$# Whoever dares to block my way will be trampled! 
#823$# Ha ha, who'll dare oppose me still after hearing this?|
48374|#824$# Looking at the line of graves behind me,
#822$# what foe would dare to stand against me?|
48375|#821$# If there's really someone like this, I'd like to call on them personally, ha ha!|
48376|#824$# Other than that woman... Hmmph. I'll subdue her, sooner or later!|
48381|What constitutes your empire?|
48382|What are your goals?|
48383|#821$# Heh heh, the goals I pursue are not things that ordinary people can easily understand...|
48384|#824$# A lot of people misunderstand me. They think that I'm a fool, that I only go after power and desires. 
#821$# Actually, these are extras that come in the process of establishing my empire. 
#822$# As long as I can reach my goal, I don't really care if I have power or not.|
48385|#823$# The empire that I would build is a kingdom larger than any before, 
#821$# one that allows all creatures to live, free of evil, as nature dictates!|
48386|#821$# One must be a great cat before he can accomplish something big. 
#822$# You can see that even as a feline emperor, I haven't yet realized my dreams; 
#823$# which is to say that my empire is an enormous plan, ha ha ha!|
48391|If the time to say goodbye should come, what what will you do after that?|
48392|What are your plans for if we ever have to part ways?|
48393|#823$# Ha ha ha, do you think you'll be able to escape from me, at some point? 
#821$# Looks like you've not come to as deep an understanding of the world as I'd hoped.|
48394|#822$# Don't worry, my information network pretty much covers everything. 
#821$# Therefore, even if I go away, for a time, your will still be in my grasp.|
48395|#822$# Saying goodbye is part of life, so don't be sad over it. 
#823$# Look at the big picture. When you can see the whole world, we'll meet again.|
48396|#821$# I'll continue my conquests after we go our separate ways, and build the greatest empire in history.|
48501|How do you manage your anger?|
48502|What do you do to resolve your anger?|
48503|#823$# Ha! There's no need to manage anger. During times like this, it's best to fight it out!|
48504|#822$# You have to find a way to vent your anger, of course. 
#823$# I think the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in combat.|
48505|#821$# When you're angry, you must find a way to release it. 
#824$# You'll become sick if you hold such strong emotion inside!|
48506|#822$# Even if you're going to explode, you can't vent your anger on just any person you find. 
#821$# Think carefully about the reasons for your anger, and its proper target.|
48511|What do you think discipline is?|
48512|According to you, what's discipline?|
48513|#822$# Discipline is necessary for the maintenance of any organization. 
#823$# Governed by steely discipline, the organization will definitely have great power!|
48514|#821$# Discipline protects the rights of the public. 
#822# The will of the people must be carried out smoothly. 
#824$# It's sometimes necessary to make hard sacrifices!|
48515|#823$# Being able to accomplish any order of the leader!  
#821$# This is my ideal sort of discipline!|
48516|#823$# Ha ha ha, my orders define the only discipline!|
48521|What do you think a team is?|
48522|According to you, what makes a team?|
48523|#822$# What? Team? 
#823$# What you probably mean, is a group of my loyal subordinates. Ha!|
48524|#824$# I usually fight by myself. I don't need a team.|
48525|#821$# Teams are just games for children. 
#823$# Capable people do not need teams at all!|
48526|#821$# With my invincible power, I'll be able to defeat all enemies in my way. 
#822$# Things like teams will only slow me down.|
48531|Do you like to talk to people?|
48532|Do you usually chat with people?|
48533|#822$# I'm a lone wolf, I never talk to people!|
48534|#821$# Do I look like someone who likes to "chat?"|
48535|#822$# I don't usually chat with people.
#821$# Why waste time doing that, when I could be strengthening my skills?|
48536|#823$# I don't need to talk to people; they should just follow my orders!|
48541|What's the thing that shocked you most?|
48542|What left you with the deepest impression?|
48543|#821$# When I led my troops galloping across the land for the first time, the mortals in the area were shocked to death.
#823$# Heh, that was only one of the things in my life that worth bragging about!|
48544|#823$#I've been through so much that nothing surprises me anymore!|
48545|#822$#Not too many things have shocked me, in my long lifetime.
#824$# However, when I first entered the Underground Labyrinth, its deep darkness really took me aback.|
48546|#821$# Ha! When I first saw you, you actually caught my attention.
#823$# Looks like you are a diamond in the rough - fulfill your potential, and don't disappoint me!|
48551|What's special about the Star Sand Desert?|
48552|Can you please give an overview of Star Sand Desert?|
48553|#822$# Star Sand Desert is full of dust and sand, and looks very wild. 
#823$# Every time I'm galloping in a wasteland, I'll always think of this place.|
48554|#822$# The world's biggest Trading Guild can be found in Star Sand Desert.  
#821$# It's said, to make business travelling more convenient, they often pay high wages for mercenaries. 
#823$# Ha! This might be a great chance for you to make money!|
48555|#821$# Why? I'm a warrior, not a tour guide!|
48556|#821$# There are Ancient Ruins, sealed by a mysterious power, in the Star Sand Desert. 
#822$# It's said that uncountable Secret Treasures are buried deep within the Ruins, and their value is enough to buy a whole kingdom.|
48561|What is Eidolon Energy?|
48562|What do you know about Eidolon Energy?|
48563|#821$# Eidolon Energy comes from the Cube of Gaia, and flows throughout the world.|
48564|#824$# How much must I teach you? Have you no general knowledge at all?
#821$# Listen, Eidolon Energy is the same power that flows from the Cube of Gaia.
#823$# After you've collected a certain amount, the altar will resonate with power, calling out to the Eidolons!|
48565|#822$# Eidolon Energy can be put into any of the ruined Eidolon Altars, awakening an Eidolon.
#821$# Awakening Eidolons enables you to fight with them, as long as sufficient power is accumulated within a short time!|
48566|#822$#  You can only get Eidolon Energy in a place where it's been gathered, like a dungeon.
#823$# Try to defeat the monsters in the dungeon - you will definitely not be disappointed!|
48571|I would like to know about skills.|
48572|Please tell me about skills.|
48573|#822$# Monsters will be temporarily resistant to the negative status inflicted by your skills, after recovering.
#821$# For example, when a monster removes a Stunned Status, there will be a short time when you can't stun them again. 
#823$# Keep this in mind!|
48574|#821$# Some monsters' skills are limited in direction and scope. 
#823$# So if you take note of effects on the ground, and avoid accordingly, it will help you greatly in battle!|
48575|#822$# The strength of a skill and the skill's level are directly related. 
#823$# Apart from that, the skill can also be strengthened through Masteries and adding magic effects to equipment. 
#821$# Spend more time studying this - it'll make your fights easier.|
48576|#821$# If you want to know more about skills, you will definitely have to experience them for yourself! 
#824$# Do you think I achieved the skills I have today, just by sitting here and talking about it?|
48581|I wanna know about titles.|
48582|What are titles for?|
48583|#823$# Humph! I don't care for worldly things like titles at all!|
48584|#822$# Even though titles are not attractive to me, personally... 
#821$# You do get bonuses after you've obtained a title. 
#823$# That is rather interesting!|
48585|#821$# It's said, that if you continuously defeat enemies in the arena, you'll get the Hit Man title. 
#823$# Heh, I'm actually itching to try because of this!|
48586|#823$# Hmmph, I don't care at all for fame! The main thing is being able to test my skills!|
48591|Give me some tips about delving into dangerous dungeons!|
48592|I would like to know about your dungeon strategy.|
48593|#822$# Dungeon strategy is no worry for me at all; it's even more relaxing than eating, for me. 
#821$# As for you, kid... You better find a group of skilful partners before taking on the challenge.|
48594|#821$# Being in a tough dungeon is not as convenient as being out in the world, where you can escape home to look for merchants and get supplies. 
#822$# If you take up the challenge rashly, without preparing yourself, you will have no one to blame but yourself!|
48595|#823$# Heh, if you really encounter a dungeon that you are unable to surpass, try fortifying your equipment. 
#821$# For mortal Humans like yourself, this can be pretty efficient.|
48596|#824$# If my Underground Labyrinth is also a dungeon to you, none of you will be able to get through, that's for certain!|
48601|What is it like to lead an army?|
48602|How does it feel, being a leader?|
48603|#823$# Ha! That's definitely the most wonderful feeling, other than battle!|
48604|#821$# As the leader of an army, apart from needing the ability to make the best decisions...
#822$# One must also have the ability to any of one's subodinates in battle.|
48605|#823$# The social characteristics of leadership are innate, hard to explain in words.|
48606|#821$# It's rather difficult to lead an army.
#821$# If you do not have real power over your subodinates, you'll be replaced very fast!|
48611|Do you take a rest by sitting down?|
48612|Do you sit down when you are tired?|
48613|#823$# What a joke! How can I get tired? Ha!
#821$# I will definitely not sit down, even when I'm taking a rest!|
48614|#822$# Why would I take a rest by sitting down? I'll stand properly, and maintain vigilance at all times!|
48615|#822$# As long as I can find an opponent to fight, I won't rest!
#823$# I can't say the same for those who are fighting me - most of the time, they rest forever. Ha!|
48616|#823$#Rest? It's something that only the weak need! What I need is constant battle!|
48621|I hear that you live in the labyrinth?|
48622|I'd like to know about the labyrinth.|
48623|#822$# Ha! You may not know this, since you're just an ordinary Envoy of Gaia.
#821$# The place where I live is no ordinary labyrinth - it's the command post of my Underground Army!|
48624|#821$# Who told you that I live in the labyrinth? 
#823$# That's where the command post of my army is - don't you let this secret out!|
48625|#821$# My Underground Command Post is built deep within the labyrinth.
#822$# The passageways there are very complicated, and filled with deadly traps.
#823$# Even if an enemy breaks in, they will never be able to get out!|
48626|#821$# That labyrinth was designed by a legendary architect.
#822$# He used natural terrain, coupled with ingenious tricks, to make the place such that people who enter it will be trapped by the illusions.
#824$# That labyrinth turned out to be so complicated, that after it was constructed, even he almost couldn't get out of it!|
48631|Who designed your Battle Armor?|
48632|Where does your Battle Armor come from?|
48633|#821$# Hahaha, you've got taste, I made this Battle Armor myself.
#823$# I made it especially tight-fitting, so as to maintain my mobility - and looks great, doesn't it!|
48634|#822$# I made this Battle Armor when I was practising my battle skills in the labyrinth. It's pretty durable.
#823$# Therefore, even though it was made some time back, it still looks as good as new.|
48635|#822$# Why? You have something to say about my outfit?
#821$# This is actually made with rare metals found in the underground labyrinth. It's not available for sale!|
48636|#821$# Hmmph, this piece is desired by collectors, and only I have it.
#822$# You have to wash it when it's dirty,  don't be careless with it!|
48641|Tell me of other Eidolons.|
48642|I want to know the gossip of Eidolons.|
48643|#821$# At the moment, my most interesting opponent is Gigas.
#823$# I hear that he's very confident of his strength - I really wish to meet him and test his ability.|
48644|#822$# Even though Uzuriel speaks and moves like a gentle and graceful girl...
#821$# She hasn't fooled my sharp eyes.
#823$# Judging from her skills and movements, she was definitely an assassin once.|
48645|#824$# Quelkulan's venom is pretty hard to handle; it's quite hard to escape unharmed, if you fight with him.
#822$# Looks like I have to find a way to deal with his venom...|
48646|#822$# Even though I hate to admit this, Tigerius Caesar is an admirable opponent.
#821$# His command strategy and talents in battle are almost second to none.
#823$# I'd really like to drink and chat with him, if I have the chance!|
48651|Do you like to fight on your own?|
48652|You like to fight alone, right?|
48653|#823$# Hmmph, this isn't just fighting single-handedly, it's my fighting style!|
48654|#821$# Let me tell you, I'm definitely stronger when I fight alone, compared to having people like you tagging along, slowing me down.
#824$# I would have trampled you long ago, if not for your potential!|
48655|#822$# Team battles build upon individual skills as their foundation.
#821$# You must keep this in mind.|
48656|#821$# Even if you have thousands of soldiers on your side, you can't rely on anyone on the battlefield.
#823$# If you want to survive through every single battle, you can depend only on your own combat ability!|
48661|Have you participated in competitions before?|
48662|Have you competed against others before?|
48663|#823$# Ha! I wouldn't call it competition, more like one-sided trampling and crushing.|
48664|#821$# I'm still alive today, due to my constant victories in battle.
#823$# Maybe I don't respect my opponents, but I certainly don't take their skills lightly.|
48665|#824$# Hmm, competition? What a naive way of thinking.
#821$# All battles require you to gamble with your life. You can only triumph if you think of it this way.|
48666|#821$# Hmmph, competitions are for children!
#823$# I will only appear in life or death battles.|
48671|Have you carried other people before?|
48672|Do you let people ride on your back?|
48673|#824$# Can you please get this clear... Letting someone ride on your back is the biggest humiliation of all.|
48674|#821$# Even if it's a wounded person, in need of help that we are talking about, I'll still not let him ride on my back.
#822$# The biggest exception I can make, is to hold him tightly in my strong arms.|
48675|#822$# As a warrior, it's a taboo to have someone on your back.
#822$# It might be fatal if someone takes that as an opportunity to sneak attack!|
48676|#821$# The back, which can't be easily reached, is often the weakest point, as it's the easiest part to attack.
#823$# That's why I'm very firm about not letting people ride on my back - it's only reasonable!|
48681|How do you train in battle techniques?|
48682|How do you hone your combat skills?|
48683|#822$# I'll put myself alone in an underground labyrinth to train my sixth sense.
#821$# Fighting in the dark like that sharpens my combat intuition.
#823$# is what wins you victory on the battlefield!|
48684|#821$# The only effective way to train up battle techniques is to take risks with your life.
#823$# The immense will to live can stimulate your full potential!|
48685|#822$# Being familiar with your weapons is very important.
#821$# I always keep my musket by my side, using it is as natural as breathing to me.|
48686|#824$# Someone like you wants to discuss battle skills with me? You should prove you're worthy, first.|
48691|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what would you do next?|
48692|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what plans do you have after that?|
48693|#821$# Hmm, what kind of answer do you want? I won't cry too hard.|
48694|#823$# Ha! I'll continue to lead my underground army and fight wars everywhere of course!
#822$# Of course, I'll carry out these activities secretly... Forget it, I've already said too much...|
48695|#822$# Everything changes. After we part ways, we might next meet on the battlefield.
#821$# If we meet again as enemies, you must definitely show your true strength.
#823$# Do not disappoint me! Ha!|
48696|#824$# What's the point of asking this? Just focus on facing the moment, together with me!|
48801|What would you do if you did something wrong?|
48802|If you did something wrong, what would you do?|
48803|#821$# I'd apologize of course, if I did something wrong! I know my manners...
#822$# One time I accidentally seduced Zaahir, I actually went to him with a gift to apologize!
#821$# However, Zaahir came to me with a gift to apologize after that, strange...|
48804|#821$# Why? Did you do something wrong?
#822$# I think that if I did something wrong, I should apologize... And if I bring a gift that's even better!|
48805|#824$# Hmmph... You think too little of me, if you question my manners like that!
#821$# You definitely have to apologize, if you do something wrong - how would I not understand something like that!|
48806|#822$# I know my manners best - I always bring a gift with me to apologize!
#821$# But it's really strange; everyone seems to be afraid of me going to say sorry to them?
#821$# Do you know why?|
48811|If you quarrel with your friends, what would you do?|
48812|What would you do if you got into a quarrel with your friends?|
48813|#824$# What quarrel? I would not quarrel with Nalani!
#821$# Mmm... However, it would be hard for Nalani to get into a quarrel even if she wants to, no?|
48814|#821$# Mmm.... I don't know...
#821$# Because I've never quarreled with Nalani...
#822$# I get along really really well with her!|
48815|#821$# Mmm... I've never quarreled with friends before, to be honest.
#822$# However, if I really did, I'll go apologize!
#821$# It's a small thing, and it helps to start get things settled.|
48816|#821$# Huh? Did you quarrel with your friends?
#821$# Mmm... I don't know who's in the wrong, but I think it's better for you to reach out first!
#822$# You don't want to lose friends... Right?|
48821|How good a cook are you?|
48822|Do you know how to cook?|
48823|#821$# Hmmph... My cooking skills are the best!
#822$# I'll cook for you, if there's a chance!|
48824|#823$# I love to cook most! It's fun, cooking for everyone...
#821$# However, people don't seem to like that I'm cooking, why's that?|
48825|#821$# I cook REALLY well!
#822$# When I cooked for Zaahir the other time, it was so good that he fainted!|
48826|#821$# Eh? Are you interested in cooking?
#822$# If you want to learn cooking, I can teach you!|
48831|What do you do when you aren't in a good mood?|
48832|When you're in a horrible mood, what do you do?|
48833|#821$# Mmm... I'd go look for Nalani for a chat!
#822$# As long as I see her smiling, I'll feel really really good...|
48834|#821$# Mmm... Cook for everyone?
#822$# When I watch everyone's faces while they eat, I find it very interesting!|
48835|#821$# Everytime I feel really, really lousy, I'll go look for Zaahir!
#822$# What do I do with Zaahir? That's our secret...|
48836|#821$# When I'm in a terrible mood, I'll sometimes visit Abraxas.
#822$# Why? Because I hate him so much, a bad mood doesn't feel wrong around him!|
48841|Is there anything you dislike?|
48842|What do you dislike?|
48843|#821$# Things I dislike? Mmm... let me think...
#821$# It would be Abraxas, Abraxas and Abraxas!|
48844|#821$# I hate people who look down on women - Zaahir was like that, in the past!
#821$# Luckily, after my efforts, Zaahir will never look down on women again...
#822$# Now Zaahir is my good friend!|
48845|#821$# Well, I simply hate young people who think they're Gaia's gift to the world! 
#822$# Eh? No, I'm not speaking of anyone specific. You're thinking too much...|
48846|#821$# Mmm... There are many things that I dislike, too many to list.
#822$# What about you? Do you have things that you dislike?|
48851|Let's talk about some of the different races in this world.|
48852|What do you know about some of the world's races?|
48853|#821$# Hmm... There are these little people that live in Cactakara Forest. I believe they call themselves Dwarves.
#822$# They care for the forest, and build magnificent robots!
#821$# I don't quite know how they make robots. Do you know?|
48854|#821$# Races? There are many of them!
#822$# I know of the Dwarf, the Avian, the Giant, the Sarpa...
#821$# Who do you want to know about?|
48855|#821$# I've always wondered...
#822$# Why do Avians not fly about?
#821$# Are they unable to fly?|
48856|#822$# Giants are very very tall! Almost twice as tall as me!
#821$# Be very careful if you encounter one!|
48861|What do you know of the Aura Kingdom?|
48862|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
48863|#822$# I heard that the Aura Kingdom is a place far more beautiful than Terra. 
#821$# All things that reside there are filled with joy and laughter.|
48864|#821$# Supposedly, residents of Aura Kingdom sport white wings.
#821$# Perhaps they are an offshoot of the Avian race?|
48865|#821$# Hmm... I've heard about Aura Kingdom, but I've never actually been there.
#821$# Please don't forget me, if you go there someday!|
48866|#821$# I don't really know much about the Aura Kingdom...
#821$# Perhaps you should ask someone else?|
48871|How do you keep life interesting?|
48872|What sorts of interesting things in life have you discovered?|
48873|#823$# Travelling with you keeps life interesting!|
48874|#823$# I'm so glad you asked me this question!
#822$# Sometimes it's important to chat with someone while travelling.
#821$# You gain so much knowledge that way.|
48875|#821$# Life is all about the details.
#821$# Pay attention to what you see around you.
#822$# You never know what could happen, if you miss something important!|
48876|#822$# You'll have to discover that for yourself!
#823$# Hmmm... I will support you on this.|
48881|What is the purpose of the social function?|
48882|What tips do you know about the social function?|
48883|#821$# The social function can inform you when your friends are online.
#821$# I think this is amazing! But how does it work?
#822$# Perhaps there's someone constantly watching us from the shadows?|
48884|#821$# I recall that you can contact your friends directly this way.
#822$# You can even obtain Loyalties by using it!
#821$# I wonder what a Loyalty is, however... Must be an Envoy thing.|
48885|#822$# You can easily contact your friends with this system!
#821$# I wish I could use it, too. Then I could contact Nalani...|
48886|#821$# Well, friends are quite important while adventuring.
#822$# So, make as many friends as you can!|
48891|Do you know of the local specialties of certain places?|
48892|Is it true that each village has its own unique product?|
48893|#822$# Oh, you're hungry! I shall cook for you!
#821$# O-oh, no need...? But I thought you were hungry!
#822$# Don't worry, I am a very good cook!|
48894|#821$# Hmm... I would love to try whatever is out there!
#822$# Don't forget to save some of what you try for me!|
48895|#821$# I have a fantastic memory; I can identify a dish with only one bite!
#821$# Which village's local specialty do you like? I can make it for you!|
48896|#822$# There are so many excellent chefs around the world; there are so many delicious specialties!
#821$# This inspires me to become an even better cook!
#822$# One day, you will taste my best dish!|
48901|Why do you always wear a mask?|
48902|Why are you always wearing a mask?|
48903|#821$# Mask? This is because...
#822$# It's a secret! Hee hee hee
#821$# I could tell you, but...|
48904|#822$# That's because if someone sees my face, I will have to marry that person!
#821$# Hee! I'm just kidding! 
#822$# I'd actually have to kill them... Hee hee...|
48905|#821$#Huh... I have been wearing this mask since the day I became a ninja.
#821$#As for the reason, I remember it being... Wanting to be more mysterious?|
48906|#821$# Oh my... That's because I'm shy...
#822$# If someone saw my face, I'd be very, very, very, very shy...|
48911|What are the requirements to be a ninja?|
48912|What kind of people can be ninja?|
48913|#821$# A ninja must be able to tolerate what cannot be tolerated!
#821$# Mmmm? Of course I'm not talking about you.
#822$# Oh my, I'm just kidding, of course! Hee hee...|
48914|#821$# Huh? How to become a ninja?
#822$# I think that, as long as one puts one's heart into it, anyone can be a ninja!|
48915|#821$# Do you want to be a ninja, too?
#823$# I think that if you were a ninja, you would be the best ninja ever!|
48916|#821$# A ninja must be quick and silent and strong!|
48921|What did you tie on your thigh?|
48922|What is that weapon do you have tied on your thigh?|
48923|#821$# This? It's a Kunai - a ninja's must-have weapon!|
48924|#821$# Eh... Don't you know?
#821$# I can't believe that you don't know about this!|
48925|#821$# These? These are kunai!
#822$# Kunais are very sharp. Do you want to try it? Hee hee...|
48926|#822$# The one on the left is the Kunai, the one on the right is the Kunei. 
#821$# What's the difference, you say? I figured you'd be smart enough to know by now! 
#822$# The one of the left is actually the same as the one on the right, haha!|
48931|Your hairband is so special!|
48932|The hairband that you use to tie your hair is very special!|
48933|#821$# Oh my... This isn't a hairband, it's a Shuriken!|
48934|#821$# Hmmph... Of course it's special!
#822$# I made this Shuriken myself!|
48935|#821$# Eh... Don't you know that this is a Shuriken?
#822$# How could you not know... You're supposed to be intelligent, right?|
48936|#822$# Hehe... It looks very good, doesn't it? Only I have this!|
48941|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
48942|Tell me some interesting tidbits about Eidolons.|
48943|#824$# I haven't met anyone as detestable as Abraxas!
#821$# That narcissistic sham! He thinks that every woman in this world likes him!|
48944|#822$# Nalani is very cute!
#821$# I love Nalani's blushing face most - it's so cute that I'd like to take a bite!|
48945|#821$# Mmm.... I think that Zaahir is very strange!
#822$# When I gave him a gift the other time, he came to apologize to me instead.
#821$# Why would anyone say "sorry" when they receive a gift? Don't you think that's very strange?|
48946|#821$# Mmm... I must say, I don't know what kind of tidbit you wants to hear.
#821$# Do you want to hear things like "Abraxas doesn't wear underwear at all?"
#821$# Or things like "Zaahir has always been running naked?"|
48951|Your thighs seem to be a bit thick!|
48952|Your thighs look muscular!|
48953|#821$# Wait... What? Hey, you're really rude! 
#824$# I can't be bothered with stuff like this! Hmmph!|
48954|#824$# You've got a way with words. A really bad way! Humph!
#821$# My thighs are not too thick. They're just the right size for kicking annoying people!|
48955|#824$# Perhaps you should find Eidolons with thinner legs, then!
#821$# I don't see why it matters to you, anyway! Hmph!|
48956|#821$# Utter nonsense! There's nothing wrong with my thighs!
#824$# You're the one with a thick problem! You're thick in the head!|
48961|What do ninja do?|
48962|What do ninja need to do?|
48963|#821$# Ninja need to learn many things!
#821$# Ninjutsu alone is already a lot to learn!|
48964|#822$# Other than Ninjutsu, ninja also need to learn magic, athletics, and more!
#821$# People without determination can't be ninja!|
48965|#821$# Eh? Do you want to be a ninja too?
#822$# Mmm... The thing is, a ninja needs to learn a lot!
#821$# Is there anything wrong? Tired of being an Envoy?|
48966|#824$# Oh... I didn't think I was that good at invisibility!
#821$# Don't you notice what I've been doing, at all?
#824$# Mmm... I'm angry!|
48971|What do you do when you're not adventuring?|
48972|Do you have things you like to do in your free time?|
48973|#821$# Nothing much. Life is boring when I'm not with you.|
48974|#821$# I like to spend time with Nalani, when I can!
#821$# She's my favorite friend.|
48975|#821$# I spend a lot of time practicing my technique.
#821$# Being this graceful isn't easy!|
48976|#821$# I have so much to do, it feels like I'll never get caught up!
#821$# If only I could be two places at once, I could get it all done and never have to leave your side!|
48981|Doesn't your scarf interfere in battle?|
48982|Does your scarf get in the way when you're fighting?|
48983|#821$# Of course not! I'm very good at what I do!|
48984|#824$# Mmm... You must not think very well of me, at all!
#821$# Clothes will not hinder my performance!|
48985|#822$# My scarf has a purpose! Only my enemies will be hurt by it.|
48986|#821$# Of course not! A scarf can come in handy, lots of different ways!|
48991|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
48992|What's your plan after we separate?|
48993|#821$# Mmm... I don't know...
#822$# Do you have any suggestions?|
48994|#821$# Eh... Do you want to leave me?
#824$# Then... then I don't want you around, either, hmmph!|
48995|#821$# Mmm... I would go hang out with Nalani!
#822$# Nalani is my very best friend!|
48996|#821$# Mmm... I hadn't thought so far ahead.....
#822$# Let's talk about it when the time comes! It's years away, anyway....|
49101|What kind of food do you like most?|
49102|What's your favorite food?|
49103|#823$#Carrots! I like carrots most!|
49104|#821$# I like carrots, but radishes are also delicious.|
49105|#821$# Aside from carrots, I also like sweets.
#822$# Candies, cakes... I love all of them|
49106|#822$# Anything from you, I like.
#823$# Carrots from you are my favourite!|
49111|Do you like books?|
49112|Do you like reading?|
49113|#824$# I don't like books. Books give me a headache.|
49114|#821$# I don't like reading... Will you like me less, now?|
49115|#822$# This is not a book. This is... is...Whatever! But it's not a book!|
49116|#821$# Huh? I don't like reading... What about you?|
49121|Do you have a crush on someone?|
49122|What kind of person do you like?|
49123|#823$# Of course it's you! I have a crush on you, now!|
49124|#824$ I liked someone very much, once, but he is dead because of me...|
49125|#822$# Uhh... I don't know...
#821$# What about you? You tell me, first!|
49126|#823$# I love rabbits and carrots!|

#823$# But still, bunnies are my favourite!|
49136|#821$# What about you? I want to know about you, first.|
49141|What's your favorite season?|
49142|Do you have a preference among seasons?|
49143|#821$# Serena likes winter, because the nights are longer!|
49144|#821$# I don't like summer, because it's hot and wet.
#824$# And we have to sleep late in summer! Bad!|
49145|#821$# Uhh... I like spring!
#821$# Because there are plenty of carrots!|
49146|#821$# I also want to know your favorite season! You first!|
49151|Tell me about the Creation Myth?|
49152|What's the story of  how the world began?|
49153|#822$# Uhh... I don't know...
#821$# Do you know? Tell me!|
49154|#822$# I heard that the Cube of Gaia is the source of everything.
#821$# But no one knows where the Cube came from.|
49155|#822$# Terra, the Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium were all created by the Cube of Gaia.
#821$# I don't understand why the Cube of Gaia created terrible places like Pandemonium.|
49156|#821$# The Cube of Gaia is the mother of life.
#822$# Me and the other Eidolons are also from the Cube of Gaia!|
49161|What's special about Port Skandia?|
49162|Can you give me an introduction to Port Skandia?|
49163|#822$# Are you testing me? You are from here!
#821$# I don't like tests.|
49164|#822$# I remember there's a huge lighthouse!|
49165|#822$# Port Skandia is your hometown, right?
#821$# I know everything related to you!|
49166|#821$# Do you miss home? I'll go there with you, don't be sad.|
49171|Do you know that every place has its local specialties?|
49172|I hear that every place has its own unique, famous dish?|
49173|#824$# You never bring me along. I don't know!|
49174|#821$# Are you hungry? I'm hungry, too.|
49175|#822$# Is there any cuisine cooked with carrots?
#821$# If there is, you must bring some for me!|
49176|#821$# I often smell something nice. I imagine it must also taste delicious.|
49181|What function does the auction house have?|
49182|I would like to know information about the auction house.|
49183|#821$# I know a place where you can buy a lot of carrots.|
49184|#822$# Hmm... I remember that you can sell the items you don't need anymore to others.
#821$# Is there a carrot seller?|
49185|#821$# Find anything you want in the auction house!
#824$# But nobody sells carrot cake...|
49186|#822$# You have to pay first, to sell anything from auction house.
#821$# But I have never tried it, so I have no idea.|
49191|I would like to know about Fame Quests.|
49192|What's so special about Fame Quests?|
49193|#821$# Uhh... I heard that it is run by a girl called Mirabelle.
#822$# They seem to offer commissions for services to help people who have problems. I don't remember very clearly.|
49194|#822$# Hmm... I don't know. What do you know?|
49195|#822$# I know! Fame Quest Bulletin Boards in different regions have various fame quests.|
49196|#821$# After finishing a fame quest, a reward will be given!
#821$# I would like to have a carrot gift box...|
49201|Do you know the Goddess of the Moon?|
49202|Have you ever seen the Moon Goddess?|
49203|#821$# I have never met the Moon Goddess. But I know she is a goddess, living in the eastern world.|
49204|#822$# I heard that she lives on the moon. Is the moon of the eastern world habitable?|
49205|#821$# I heard that she has a pharmacist rabbit!
#823$# I really want to see that rabbit! It must be very very cute!|
49206|#821$# I have never met her. But I really envy her.
#821$# I also want a rabbit! a pharmacist rabbit!|
49211|Why won't you meet Aelius?|
49212|Aelius is looking for you, do you know that?|
49213|#1$# Did. You. Mention. Aelius?
#821$# How dare such a despicable and shameless pest want to see me?|
49214|#821$# Didn't I tell you not to mention him in front of me?
#1$# I will forgive you this time. Just don't do it again...
#821$# We will need to think about what to do with your tongue again...|
49215|#821$# Didn't I tell you not to mention him in front of me? 
#1$# Is something is wrong with your ears?
#821$# If they don't work, then there's no reason to keep them...|
49216|#821$# I know he is looking for me, but why should I meet with him?
#1$# I have made an unforgivable mistake because of him.
#821$# What qualifies him to meet me? And why should I meet such a guy?|
49221|I want to touch your ears.|
49222|Can I touch your tail?|
49223|#822$# Uhh... The Mother Goddess said they are untouchable...
#821$# But if it's you... I guess it would be fine.|
49224|#821$# Uhh... But I'm very ticklish...
#821$# If you really want to touch it... I'll allow you, but just this once!|
49225|#822$# The Mother Goddess said only the one who will take care of me forever can do that!
#821$# You will take care of me forever... Wouldn't you?|
49226|#821$# Well... Then I get to touch you!|
49231|I heard that you are quite old.|
49232|How old are you?|
49233|#821$# Well...That's a secret.|
49234|#821$# Huh? I'm not old at all!
#822$# I am as old as you!|
49235|#821$# Hmm... Did Kotonoha put you up to this?
#824$# It must be her! She likes playing jokes on me!|
49236|#821$# I don't know your age! You tell me, first!|
49241|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
49242|Tell me some interesting tidbits about the Eidolons.|
49243|#823$# Grimm is so tiny and cute! I want him as my own Eidolon... can I do that?|
49244|#821$# Tigerius Caesar is my good friend. Some times he carries me to catch the wind!|
49245|#823$# Uzuriel often gives me candy. I like playing with her most.|
49246|#824$# I don't like Kotonoha, hum!|
49251|When do you normally go to bed?|
49252|Do you always go to bed late?|
49253|#821$# I go to bed very early, everyday! As soon as the sun rises!|
49254|#821$# Don't you remember? Eidolons don't need to sleep!|
49255|#821$# Hmm... I'm tired...|
49256|#822$# I don't know... I am going to bed.|
49261|What is the book in your hand?|
49262|What's in the book?|
49263|#822$# Huh? ! It's... it's a dictionary!
#821$# The dictionary is very, very boring... You won't be interested in it!|
49264|#821$# I don't want you to know about it. Stop peeping!|
49265|#822$# This is not an ordinary book, it's my sketchbook.|
49266|#821$# I should let you see it, if it is your wish...
#824$# But I don't want to...|
49271|Are you and Aelius siblings?|
49272|I heard that Aelius and you are brother and sister.|
49273|#821$# Brother? I have no brother! After that shot, my brother was already dead.
#821$# The guy you're talking about was only someone who looks like my brother.|
49274|#821$# Younger Brother? What kind of brother would mislead his own sister making such a horrible mistake?
#821$# I don't have such a brother! And I don't want to!|
49275|#821$# Who are you talking about? Is it that the coward, who covers his face with a cloak all the time?
#821$# That is not my brother. Just a pathetic, dirty worm...|
49276|#821$# Remember to never, ever mention Aelius in front of me.
#1$# If your brain doesn't work well... Then I will help you remember it. With pain.|
49281|May I sit on your moon?|
49282|Would you allow me to sit on your moon?|
49283|#824$# Hmm... I think...There is not enough space for you...|
49284|#821$# Huh? You want to sit on my moon?
#821$# But... It's only designed for me!|
49285|#824$# You're too big for it. I worry it will break.|
49286|#821$# Huh? This moon is totally un..uncomfortable!
#822$# And... and it hurts your bottom!|
49291|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
49292|What's your plan after we part ways?|
49293|#821$# You don't like me anymore? You don't want me be with you any longer?|
49294|#821$# I'll do whatever you say! Please don't leave me!|
49295|#821$# I just want to stay with you.|
49296|#824$# Uhh... I will be a good girl, please, don't leave me...|
49401|What do you desire most?|
49402|Do you have a dream?|
49403|#821$#Don't worry about me for once, let's talk about your dreams! I'm really curious.|
49404|#822$Don't compare me with any ordinary woman; 
#822$#as the great pharaoh of my nation, I, personally, can grant any wish.|
49405|#821$#Aspirations...? No one has asked me such a thing in ages;
#822$#they all seem to think that women like me have no ambitions, and I will not abide it!|
49406|#821$#I'm no plain girl, only seeking to find her true love.
#822$#My dream is even more ambitious - I will rule and have the love of an entire people.|
49411|Do you have a favorite animal?|
49412|What do you think of animals?|
49413|#823$#Wild pheasant is rather delicious, although they do have quite a bit too many feathers...
#821$#Oh, you didn't mean it that way? What was the question, then?|
49414|#821$#Animals? Hmm, I bet you like little fuzzy animals.
#822$#Are you wondering how I know? Hehe... 
#821$#Well, let's just say that you aren't the first to be captivated by my beautiful fur.|
49415|#821$#Since we're on this subject, can you tell me why so many humans wear delicious tanukis on their heads?
#822$#Could it be that....they want to seduce me? Ugh! I will not fall for such a thing!|
49416|#823$#I like animals that are a bit plump, with a lot of meat and not too many feathers or thick fur.
#822$#What? You're not talking about food?
#821$#Are you not going to assist me in preparing a lovely meal?|
49421|What kind of person are you interested in?|
49422|What kind of personality is important to you?|
49423|#822$#I prefer mature men who are independent and possess great ambitions. They are the most charming, no?|
49424|#821$#Huh? Why do you suddenly ask this?
#822$#Has Tigerius put you up to this?
#823$#Sigh, he just won't give up...|
49425|#821$#As the queen, do you think I should be afraid of not finding the perfect one for me?
#822$#I am looking for an equal who can stand at my side always.|
49426|#821$#Before replying, I'd like to hear your response first.
#822$#Certainly you don't like those humans who look great but have no brains, right?|
49431|What's your favorite weather?|
49432|Do you have a favorite weather?|
49433|#822$#I love bright, sunny days the best.|
49434|#821$#Even though the rain moisturizes the earth, I still don't like like it. 
#824$#I really hate it when my fur is all wet.|
49435|#821$#My kingdom doesn't have much rain in a year. 
#822$#What I'm most accustomed to are bright sunny days.|
49436|#821$#Naturally, I love a bright and sunny day.
#823$#When the weather's good, the most comfortable thing is to lie flat on the rooftop, basking in the sun.|
49441|Do you have any wisdom to share about art?|
49442|To you, what do you think is the most beautiful?|
49443|#821$# Huh? Don't you already have the answer after seeing me?|
49444|#821$#I...can't seem to put it into words. You'll understand more the longer we spend time together.|
49445|#821$#Beauty is rather subjective, don't you think?
#822$#If you don't think I'm beautiful, then that's ok - your sense of beauty is just different from everyone else.|
49446|#821$#Beautiful things always make people happy. 
#822$#Very few people remain unhappy after seeing me!|
49451|Let's talk about the races of Azuria.|
49452|Can you tell me about other races?|
49453|#821$#Most of the Dwarves live in Cactakara Forest.
#824$#They are enthusiastic about studying strange machines and devices that I can't understand at all.|
49454|#821$#Sarpa are not friendly towards humans at all, so don't you go provoking them!
#823$#I...am a bit curious as to how they might taste, though...|
49455|#821$#The giants live in Triatio Highlands. Even though they're incredibly slow, their strength should not be ignored.
#822$#If you don't have the agility I do, you had better avoid getting too close to them.|
49456|#821$#The Makar who rule over the Ventos Prairie are very prideful and their strength is incredible.
#823$#I sometimes think that Makar a bit similar to someone I know...
#822$#However, he doesn't have a mane like the Makar do.|
49461|What's unique about the Star Sand Desert?|
49462|Can you tell me all about the Star Sand Desert?|
49463|#821$#Everytime I see Star Sand Desert, I long to see my own kingdom.
#822$#The wide desert sands and brilliant shining sun remind me of home...|
49464|#823$#Star Sand Desert is bright and sunny nearly every day. I would love to relax in the sun some time.|
49465|#821$#There are some gigantic skeletons in the Star Sand Desert that are quite amazing to behold.
#822$#Oh, how I wish to see what those people were like when they were still alive...|
49466|#822$#The grand Ozymand Temple of the Star Sand Desert has a very long history.
#821$#It seems to be home to creatures that do not belong in the realm of Terra...|
49471|What's special about the Sky Tower?|
49472|Can you tell me anything about the Sky Tower?|
49473|#821$#I have heard that there's a mystical potion at the very top of the tower than can return the dead to life.
#823$#While I am interested in reincarnation, I'm not so sure about this...|
49474|#821$#Many different kinds of strong, magical weapons can be found on every level of the Sky Tower.
#821$#As long as you can pass every checkpoint, you'll be able to get the weapons you long for.|
49475|#821$#Many dangerous traps lay in wait within the Sky Tower.
#822$#If you plan to traverse its dangerous halls, you should take a cunning lady like me along.|
49476|#821$#You can only enter the Sky Tower at specific times,
#822$#and if you miss the opening, you won't be able to enter.|
49481|I'd like to have some information about Stat Points.|
49482|Do you have any tips on Stat Points?|
49483|#822$#When you have earned enough experience, you will receive stat points that you can allocate.
#821$#You can assign the points to wherever you think is best for your role.|
49484|#821$#If you want to be swift and agile as I am,
#822$#you should try allocating your points into speed. This will speed up your attacks!|
49485|#822$#Hmm, looking at your fragile frame and broken armor,
#821$#I would suggest that you allocate some more points into defense in order to increase your chance of survival...|
49486|#822$#If you're not satisfied with how you've spent your Stat Points, you can spend some coin to reallocate them.
#821$#However, you have better have your finances in check beforehand - I definitely won't lend you any money!|
49491|What are the benefits of salvaging equipment?|
49492|Do you have any information about salvaging?|
49493|#821$#When you salvage equipment you don't want, you'll obtain fragments.
#822$#These fragments can be use to fortify your own equipment.|
49494|#821$#If you find yourself running out of space, you can simply salvage the equipment that you don't want.|
49495|#822$#When you salvage fragments from gold quality equipment that's above level 50, you will have a chance of finding items that can altar your equipment.
#821$#You can use these items on your own equipment and tailor them to fit your needs.|
49496|#821$#Be absolutely sure that you want to salvage the equipment before you do it! There's no reversing the process.|
49501|Can you tell me about your kingdom?|
49502|What's unique about your kingdom?|
49503|#824$#My kingdom is very, very far from here...
#821$#Hopefully, someday, I'll be able to show you around.|
49504|#822$#My kingdom is a very hot land with no winters, only endless summers!
#821$#It's pretty similar to Star Sand Desert, actually.|
49505|#821$#There's a river in my kingdom that people call the Mother River. Everyone depends on it for survival.
#822$#Every time the river overflows, we hold a great ceremony.
#821$#We celebrate the generosity and kindness of the Mother River, as well as the upcoming harvest year.|
49506|#821$#When the Mother River overflows, it covers a huge are with nutrient rich water - it looks really beautiful.
#822$#I've been gone for so long... I really do miss seeing that impressive sight.|
49511|Do you know Tigerius Caesar?|
49512|What kind of Eidolon is Tigerius Caesar?|
49513|#821$#Tigerius Caesar is a very brave fighter. He's incredibly courageous and actually very charismatic.
#822$#It's a pity that... Sigh, I think I'd better hold my tongue for now.|
49514|#821$#Handsome and dashing, whenever Tigerius wins a glorious battle he is always surrounded by adoring women.
#822$#How can anyone ignore such a charismatic person?|
49515|#821$#Everyone knows of the great Tigerius Caesar!
#822$#Does he really need an introduction?|
49516|#821$#Tigerius? I kind of miss the time we spent together. 
#822$#Everytime he flies off the handle, I chuckle for the entire day.|
49521|Can I pat your head?|
49522|Do you like people patting you on the head?|
49523|#822$#What? How could I just let people go around touching my elegant head as they please?|
49524|#821$#I am very picky about the select few who I will allow to pet my majestic head.
#822$#Do you think you are qualified to do so?|
49525|#822$#Don't compare me to those lowly cats you keep as pets - 
#822$#not just anyone can touch my head!|
49526|#823$#Want to pet me on the head, do you? Then you will have to pay the price!|
49531|How do you maintain your soft fur?|
49532|What do you do to keep your fur soft and smooth?|
49533|#821$#When I wake up in the mornings I brush my fur very carefully.|
49534|#823$#I frequently brush my fur so that it always looks perfectly soft and smooth.|
49535|#821$#Why do you ask? You don't have fur, so I don't see why...
#822$#Ah! Is Tigerius trying to get my secret again?!|
49536|#822$#I'm naturally beautiful! My fur is soft and smooth almost without any maintenance at all.|
49541|I wanna know if other Eidolons keep secrets.|
49542|Do you know any interesting Eidolon gossip?|
49543|#821$#Tsubaki always keeps her face hidden. No one has ever seen what she really looks like.
#821$#Aelius also uses a scarf to obscure his face, nobody knows what he looks like either...
#822$#I wonder if these two are related somehow?|
49544|#821$#Endora is always a bother to me!
#824$#Every time she sees me, she runs up and tries to pet my head!|
49545|#823$#Serena is young and cute - she looks like she might be delicious...
#822$#Ah! Errr, I didn't say anything! Definitely nothing about eating someone!|
49546|#821$#Everytime I see Kotonoha, my claws somehow feel itchy... I'm really not sure why!|
49551|Why did you want to rule?|
49552|How did you end up as queen?|
49553|#821$#I feel as if I was born to rule, so it is just natural...|
49554|#821$#Why is it that people think a woman can't rule just as well as a man?
#822$#I make it clear to all that I am just as good, if not better, than any other ruler I know.|
49555|#821$#It's rule or be ruled, don't you think?
#822$#Such a simple question that was. Do you have any other inquiries?|
49556|#821$#To survive in my world, to be at the top is the best way.|
49561|You're very fond of Tigerius Caesar, aren't you?|
49562|Do you like Tigerius Caesar or not?|
49563|#821$#Tigerius? I don't remember mentioning him to you before - have I?|
49564|#821$#What does it matter if I like or dislike him?
#823$#Tigerius will do what he wants, regardless of anyone else's opinion on him.|
49565|#822$#Ah... You know, Tigerius Caesar is handsome, dashing, and a gentleman with women.
#821$#Who wouldn't like a man like that?|
49566|#821$#Why do you bring him up all of a sudden? Do you have some news?
#822$#Oooh, did he send you to ask these questions? Haha!|
49571|What's it like to conquer a kingdom?|
49572|Can you tell me what it's like to rule?|
49573|#821$#Ah...That's a tricky one to explain.
#822$#It's definitely no small feat to conquer a realm. The hard part is how to rule with kindness and caring.|
49574|#821$#The conqueror and the conquered need not be at odds. I find it is best to rule benevolently.|
49575|#821$#When you rule a kingdom, you have to remember that it is your responsibility for the happiness, health, and comfort of your people.
#822$#What's the point of ruling if everyone hates you?|
49576|#821$#If your people love you, then you can claim that you can rule them.
#824$#If the people don't love you, then sooner or later you will be overthrown.
#824$#And if your people really despise you...it can be even worse.|
49581|Your eyes seem very different from the other Eidolons.|
49582|Your eyes are mesmerizing...|
49583|#821$#Don't stare into my eyes too long, or you might become charmed...
#822$#I can't follow you if you're trying to be my follower!|
49584|#821$#Ah, yes. Many people fall at my feet when they look into my beautiful eyes.|
49585|#822$#Not many people in the world have eyes like mine. I can bewitch someone with a single glance.|
49586|#822$#It's true, isn't it? Once upon a time, because of these entrancing eyes, Tigerius also...hehehe...|
49591|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
49592|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
49593|#821$#If we do part, I will finally return to my kingdom.
#822$#I will stretch out in the hot sun and watch the Mother River flow across my lands.|
49594|#822$#Do you dare to cast me aside? Are you somehow not satisfied with me?|
49595|#821$#This is not for you to worry about. With my cunning capabilities, is there any place I could not go? Any thing I could not do?|
49596|#822$#Ha, maybe I'll go catch up with Tigerius... Just kidding!|
49701|What sort of person interests you?|
49702|What do you look for in a partner?|
49703|#822$#Ha! As if I'd tell you! Just having to ask shows you're not qualified for the job.|
49704|#821$#I don't understand why guys go for girls with ridiculous pink pigtails. Ugh! It just makes me want to yank on them!
#822$#And yank, and yank, and keep on yanking...|
49705|#821$#(Sigh...) My heart belongs to a young boy who doesn't know I exist.
#822$#To make up for it, I just play dumb around all of my fans who adore me!|
49706|#824$#Arrogant people are the worst!
#822$#How can they pretend to be the best when I'm obviously far better than they are at everything?|
49711|Do you have any weaknesses?|
49712|Is there anything you aren't good at?|
49713|#821$#What? How could you even say such a thing? Of course there isn't anything I'm not perfect at!
#822$#I'm offended that you've underestimated me!|
49714|#824$#It can be annoying dealing with people from...  "The Organization."
#821$#What? Of course, yes, THAT "Organization." Why do you even need to ask?|
49715|#823$#Ugh! This again? For your birthday, I'm going to buy you a dictionary.
#821$#Look up the entry for "perfect" and you'll find "Endora" written right there!|
49716|#823$#My only weakness is that I'm just TOO beautiful!
#824$#That must by why the stupid boy always blushes and runs away...
#822$#Hm? Oh, nothing. Didn't say a thing. Nope.|
49721|What do you do when you're in a bad mood?|
49722|What cheers you up?|
49723|#822$#Of course I'm going to make a scene if I'm unhappy!
#821$#But I have to be careful, otherwise "The Organization" will find out.
#824$#Those people give me the creeps!|
49724|#821$#When I'm in a bad mood, I cheer myself up by punching Serif until he passes out.
#823$#Why? Duh! Everyone says that if you like somebody, you should hit on him and take him out. Right?|
49725|#823$#My scythe always cheers me up when I'm unhappy!
#821$#Only problem is it's a bit on the small side... Don't you think?|
49726|#821$#I didn't realize you cared so much about me!
#822$#Now that I know, I've designated you as my personal stress-reliving punching bag!
#823$#Oh relax, I won't hit too hard... It'll be like a massage. We both win!|
49731|Do you have any amazing stories to tell?|
49732|What's the most amazing experience you've ever had?|
49733|#821$#Ha ha! I'll share one story with you... But first you need to fall asleep!
#823$#I love sneaking into people's dreams at night!|
49734|#822$#Ugh! What amazes me is that the stupid boy sees anything at all in the little pink brat!
#824$#This world is just too much sometimes...|
49735|#821$#A goody two-shoes like you could never appreciate my amazingnessitude!
#823$#I sneak into people's dreams and discover all of their dirty little secrets!|
49736|#823$#I know all kinds of juicy stuff! More than you could ever imagine!
#821$#If you choose to serve me well...
#822$#Maaaybe I'll share some with you. Maybe. If I'm in a good mood.|
49741|Have you ever joined any groups or clubs?|
49742|Do you ever participate in group activities?|
49743|#821$#Hehe, well, if you really wanna know, I'll tell you one...
#822$#When I was in school... I was a cheerleader! That's right, cheerleader.|
49744|#821$#Haven't you noticed how absolutely perfect and wonderful I am in every single way?
#822$#I am the most popular, fabulous, shining star that any Social Club could ever hope to have! I still can't believe they never let me join!|
49745|#821$#When I was a cheerleader, I stole the hearts of millions and millions of cute boys!
#821$#Some of them still don't leave me alone, so I started transforming them into things. That's where my little pumpkins come from!|
49746|#822$#Group activities? You mean, like, after-school stuff, right?
#821$#Okay, phew. You had me worried there for a second.|
49751|What's so special about the Sky Tower?|
49752|What can you tell me about the Sky Tower?|
49753|#821$#The Sky Tower, huh? Supposedly it's chock-full of fearsome baddies and fabulous treasure!
#823$#What, are you scared? Hmph! Not me! I want to go check it out!|
49754|#821$#I wonder how tall the Sky Tower is... And I wonder how much damage a coin would do if I dropped it off the top?|
49755|#821$#The Sky Tower? The ol' G.B. had it locked up a long time ago.
#823$#I wonder why? What sort of freaky business is inside?|
49756|#821$#Guess what? I snuck into the Sky Tower once!
#823$#I'll bet you want to know what's in there, don'tcha?
#822$#You do? Haha! I'll never tell!|
49761|What do you know about the Star Sand Desert?|
49762|Is there anything interesting in the Star Sand Desert?|
49763|#822$#Bleh! Why are you interested in that dull, dry place?
#824$#Don't you know that all that sun and sand is bad for your skin?|
49764|#823$#A little birdie told me that there are a lot of CRAAAZY treasures hidden in the Ozymand Temple.
#821$#You want to get them, don't you? I sure do! Get out the sunblock and let's go-go-go!|
49765|#821$#There are a lot of mercenaries looking for work in the Star Sand Desert.
#823$#Hmm, maybe if I hired some of them, they could knock some sense into that stupid boy...|
49766|#823$#There's a camp built around an oasis in the Star Sand Desert.
#821$#I guess water is pretty important when the sun threatens to melt your face off every day.|
49771|Can you tell me a little bit about Alchemy?|
49772|What do you know about Alchemy?|
49773|#821$#Alchemists can supposedly turn stone into gold, which seems kinda cool.
#822$#But then they just sit around mixing potions and bottles and junk... Bo-oring! Who has time for that?|
49774|#822$#Pfft! I could never wrap my head around such a boring subject.
#824$#The most fun I had in Alchemy class was dreaming up excuses to get out of tests...|
49775|#821$#(Yawn) You'll put me to sleep if you keep talking about Alchemy.
#824$#There are a bunch of Alchemist nerds hanging out in Navea; why don't you go talk to them?|
49776|#2$#Alchemy, huh... I wonder if they can cook up a love potion...
#822$#Uh... What? No, I didn't say anything!|
49781|What's the deal with fishing?|
49782|What do you know about fishing?|
49783|#821$#Yeah, fishing can be interesting, I guess. If you've got nothing better to do with your time...
#823$#I usually just wait for other people to catch something, then beat them up and take it from them!|
49784|#821$#Fishing? In school, the cool kids like me never had time for boring junk like fishing!
#823$#But... Well... Actually... I kinda like fishing. Don't you dare tell anyone! I'll kick your butt!|
49785|#821$#Fish have all kinds of uses! You can fry them, poach them, sashimi them...
#823$#There are even some that can give you XP bonuses! Neat!|
49786|#821$#If you think you've got good fishin' chops, you can challenge those King Fish that rule each area.
#823$#You'll earn big, huge, stupefying rewards if you can bag them!|
49791|What do you know about monster conquests?|
49792|Do you have any tips on monster conquests?|
49793|#822$#Pfft! There are weak monsters, there are tough monsters, and then there's me!
#824$#If you can't win by yourself, then just hide behind me and I'll do all the work. Like always!|
49794|#821$#Every baddie has a weakness. Some don't like fire. Some don't like status effects. Others can't handle criticism.
#823$#Study your enemy until you know what makes them tick, and then CRUSH THEM!|
49795|#821$#What? It's easy! Just avoid getting hit while doling out as much damage as you can.
#823$#Even a noob like you can manage that, right?|
49796|#821$#Make sure you have a proper meal before going into battle!
#823$#A lot of cuisine has beneficial effects that can help you win.|
49801|Where do you live?|
49802|Where did you live before now?|
49803|#822$#You see this? This is my annoyed face.
#824$#I used to live in a crummy place. I'm never going back!|
49804|#822$#Stupid "Organization" and it's stupid rules... There was never any fun to be had there, ever!|
49805|#822$#That place sucks!
#824$#It's hard to believe that amazing people like myself and Ser - I mean, that stupid boy - came from there!
#822#Oh, and the pink brat is from there, too. But that's about what I'd expect.|
49806|#822$#I hate that place! But the stupid boy seems to like it, so maybe I'll try and find him there...|
49811|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
49812|What makes your scythe special?|
49813|#821$#What, this old thing? It has served me well in many battles.
#823$#But... Oh, I just don't know... I think I might need something bigger, don't you?|
49814|#821$#I got this scythe from the same place the pink brat got her silly little twig.
#823$#I'd say I got a much better deal, wouldn't you?|
49815|#823$#My scythe? I've named her Justine, and sometimes we have deep conversations. That's not weird, is it?|
49816|#821$#Be careful what you say! Justine will kick your butt if you aren't nice to her!
#823$#Sometimes we'll find someone who is sleeping and cut their dreams up into pieces, and then rearrange them!|
49821|Where did you get your kitty backpack?|
49822|Does your kitty backpack have a name?|
49823|#822$#He's no ordinary backpack! His name is Serifinho!
#824$#Oh, look, you've made him nervous. It's okay, little Serifinho, they didn't mean it...
|
49824|#824$#A backpack? Can't you use your eyes?
#821$#How could you mistake my little kitty Serifinho for just a backpack?|
49825|#824$#Hmph! How rude!
#824$#Asking me if Serifinho is a backpack... Look, you've gone and made him upset!|
49826|#822$#Serifinho, this silly Envoy thinks you're just a backpack! Ha! I know!
#822$#Don't worry, Serifinho! Just ignore them like anyone else who doesn't know what they're talking about.|
49831|Do you think you're attractive?|
49832|Do you get compliments about your figure?|
49833|#823$#Took you long enough to notice!
#821$#Face of an angel and the body of a devil! That's Endora for ya!|
49834|#823$#Of course! I have the best figure out of all the Eidolons!
#821$#And if we're being honest here, I'm a little miffed that you even had to ask!|
49835|#823$#Of course! I'm cute and popular!
#821$#Just look at all this fan mail I write to myself... I mean, that my adoring fans send me!
#824$#Why would anyone want to hang out with those other dumpy Eidolons?|
49836|#823$#Ha! I knew this was coming. You, just like everyone else in the world, has fallen for me!
#821$#It's tough being super cute and popular, but somehow I manage to survive.|
49841|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
49842|Have any good rumors about other Eidolons?|
49843|#822$#Have you ever tried talking to Eligos? ZOMG! Such a bore!
#824$#He's always like 'Oh, I'm rich and powerful, but I'm sad all the time.' Gag me with a spoon!|
49844|#822$#Uzuriel is the highest ranking member of the Super-Hyper-Awesome Endora Fan Club.
#821$#She's the perfect Number Two; almost as skilled, but nowhere near as cute!|
49845|#821$#Nazrudin is SO annoying! He's always like, 'Sit up straight! Shoulders back! Your salad fork goes on the left!'
#823$#That eel drives me crazy! I'm glad he lives underwater so I don't have to deal with him.|
49846|#823$#I like Alessa. You know why? We both share a deep hatred of the pink brat.
#821$#Alessa plays a crucial role in my plan to get rid of the pink brat for good. Do you want in on it as well?|
49851|How well do you know Serif?|
49852|What do you think about Serif?|
49853|#2$#Serif? Ooooh, where is that stupid boy?|
49854|#821$#Just so you know, the stupid boy is mine. Got it?
#822$#He's off limits! Forbidden! Don't even think about it!|
49855|#822$#OH MY GAWL! That stupid boy is obsessed with the awful pink brat!
#824$#Outrageous, right? What can he possibly see in her?|
49856|#2$#Serif and I had a breakthrough today! At long last the stupid boy will be all mine!
#822$#What? I did NOT drug him! How could you even think that? Although... it's not a bad idea...|
49861|Do you know Merrilee?|
49862|Do you have a problem with Merrilee?|
49863|#822$#Barf! I hate the pink brat so much I can't even think straight!
#824$#And yet the stupid boy is obsessed with her! It just isn't fair...
|
49864|#821$#Have you ever tried to talk to her? She only knows three words: snakes, apples, and 'loooooove.' Blech!
#822$#I'm a hundred times more interesting than she is! A thousand! A kajillion!|
49865|#821$#Merrilee? Just saying her name is enough to make my skin crawl!
#822$#(Sigh...) I need some chocolate.|
49866|#821$#Seriously? You're not comparing me to that pink brat, are you?
#823$#No? Good. Trust me, you don't want to be on my bad side.|
49871|What's your insight into fashion?|
49872|Do you get compliments on your outfit?|
49873|#821$#I was the most popular girl in school!
#823$#The socialite, the trend-setter, Miss Popular; everyone copied my style.|
49874|#823$#You like my style, too, right? What am I saying... of course you do! I look great in everything!
#821$#I could turn up in a garbage bag and still be Prom Queen! Or worse... denim!|
49875|#823$#The centerpiece of my ensemble is my adorable kitty...
#821$#Serifinho is a hundred times better than any other cat in the world!|
49876|#824$#You bet! Everyone loves kickin' it with Endora!
#822$#...except the stupid boy. He runs away whenever he sees me. It makes me so mad!|
49881|Wow, that's a, uh, 'great' dance!|
49882|Where did you learn to dance like that?|
49883|#821$#Right? I'm the best dancer there ever was and ever will be!
#823$#I used to be the captain and president and CEO of the cheerleading squad. I've got the moves!|
49884|#823$#There's a song that goes along with this dance. Want me to sing it?
#821$#...hey, wait! Where are you going?|
49885|#824$#Dancing is just one of my many amazing talents. That's why everyone loves me!
#823$#I'm just so talented, and popular, and beautiful, and awesome, and smart, and cool, and down-to-earth, and...|
49886|#821$#I got some hot moves, right? You want me to teach you how to dance?
#823$#Of course, you'll never be as good as me, but don't let that get you down!|
49891|If we had to part ways, where would you go?|
49892|What would you do if we parted company?|
49893|#823$#Oh, I'll totally be fine, I swear. I have all sorts of stuff to keep me busy.
#822$#There is still a lot of stalking... uhm, I mean 'quality time,' with Serif to be had!|
49894|#823$#I'll never forget you. I always remember each and every one of my fans!
#821$#...just so long as you keep sending me fan mail.|
49895|#821$#Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?
#822$#The pink brat put you up to it, didn't she? Ooooh! I'm gonna throttle her!|
49896|#824$#As if I'd let one of my adoring fans leave me!
#821$#Be careful if you do ever manage to slip away, though...
#823$#I'll sneak into your dreams at night and make mischief!|
50001|What kind of people do you like to date?|
50002|What do you look for in a partner?|
50003|#821$#Dates? You mean like...the fruit?|
50004|#822$#I'm looking for a partner who values me as I truly am, not only as they perceive me to be.|
50005|#824$#Dating seems to be a very important ritual among humans.
#821$#Tell me more about it! What do you do on a date?|
50006|#824$#In the past, I was courting someone and...
#822$#Oh snap, I wasn't going to mention that!|
50011|Do you like to travel?|
50012|What are your thoughts on traveling?|
50013|#823$#Travel is fun! I haven't done too much traveling, and that's part of the reason I decided to go on this adventure with you.|
50014|#821$#When you're saving the world, danger doesn't usually show up on your doorstep.
#822$#You've gotta travel to find the danger, then hit it with your fists of fury!|
50015|#821$#I've come to enjoy traveling with you.
#823$#It makes me so happy when each day brings new sights and sensations.|
50016|#824$#We saw so much sadness while on the road.
#821$#My other self is reminded frequently about how little of this world she knows about.
#823$#Fortunately, I assured her that the world is not yet beyond saving.|
50021|What's a good way to train?|
50022|How do you train for battle?|
50023|#821$#Traveling seems to be doing the trick. You never know what this adventure will throw at us next - it's excellent physical and mental preparation!|
50024|#821$#Keeping to my diet is a feat in itself! Every time I have to step on that scale, it's like psyching up before a big battle!
#822$#Crap...did I just say that aloud?|
50025|#824$#It's hard to say. What works for me might not be as effective for you.
#821$#Developing your self-discipline and critical thinking will help you prevail in any endeavor, though, so stick with those for sure.|
50026|#822$#Practice does not always make perfect - perfect practice makes perfect. Be sure not to rush - the purpose of training is to learn the right way.|
50031|Do you have any tips for getting along with people?|
50032|Any advice for me about relationships?|
50033|#824$#I don't quite understand your meaning.
#821$#I always thought we got along pretty well, you and I...|
50034|#821$#It's easier to get along with birds than humans.
#824$#A bird acts as their heart directs, but the words of a human are often very different from their actions.|
50035|#821$#The world has in it many bad people, but there are many who are good as well.
#821$#Wherever I go, my calling is to protect the innocent from those who would do them harm.|
50036|#821$#It's important to be open to new experiences, even if you're a bit afraid at first.
#823$#I didn't know quite what I was getting into, but then I came to this world and met you. Worth taking a chance on, wouldn't you say?|
50041|What animals do you like?|
50042|What do you think of animals?|
50043|#823$#Oh, I love little birds so much!
#821$#When they're about to make their first flight, I always cheer them on!|
50044|#823$#Animals don't lie, so it's comforting to talk with them.|
50045|#821$#I feel like all birds are weird second and third cousins.
#823$#My little pal here is my favorite bird, though.|
50046|#821$#When I'm feeling down, birds always tend to come around to cheer me up.
#823$#I try to return the favor by helping them out wherever I can.|
50051|What's it like in Navea?|
50052|What do you think about Navea?|
50053|#821$#Navea is full of motion and splendor, like a kaleidoscope! It's like there's always something going on there.
#824$#The first time we went there, my little feathered friend here got so wound up, she actually fainted.|
50054|#821$#Navea's always so full of life and laughter.
#823$#Truly, it must be a holy city, to bring peace and joy to the lives of so many.|
50055|#824$#I felt a little awkward walking around the streets of Navea.
#822$#People stared at me a lot. Young men's eyes seemed to double in size when I walked by.|
50056|#824$#Humans seem to like living very cozily, with many coexisting in a small space.
#821$#My palace is actually much larger than the city of Navea.|
50061|What can you tell me about the Avians?|
50062|I'd like to know more about the Avians.|
50063|#821$I was taken aback the first time I saw the Avians.
#824$To be birds, and yet incapable of flight...honestly, I felt a bit sorry for them.|
50064|#824$In spite of being a bird-lover, I'm none too fond of the Avians.
#821$If I see them, I avoid them if I can.|
50065|#821$I heard before that the Avians were strange creatures, but I didn't understand how until I saw them for myself.
#824$Now I can see why many races don't have a high opinion of them.|
50066|#824$Why DID the Avians give up their ability to fly?
#821$#Have your world's scholars chronicled how it happened?|
50071|What can you tell me about PvP?|
50072|Tell me about the Arena.|
50073|#821$#The Arena provides a good opportunity to train.
#821$#Better to make your mistakes there than on the battlefield, right?|
50074|#821$#I fought some battles in tournaments long ago.
#823$#They called me the Scarlet Whirlwind for my punishing kicks of fiery awesomeness!
#822$#In fact, this one time, there I was, down to my last HP...|
50075|#823$#If you're going to the arena, clad yourself in purple-quality gear.
#821$#Ultimately it's about skill, but good equipment makes you that much more effective.|
50076|#821$#I've heard that if you want to test your skill, the Arena is the place to do it.
#823$#I think you're good enough to come out a champ. Let's see some gold medals!|
50081|I want to know more about archaeology.|
50082|What can you tell me about Archaeology?|
50083|#821$#Archaeology is a great way to learn about who - and what - came before us.
#823$#You're very fortunate to have the opportunity to unearth the treasures of the past.|
50084|#821$#I just remembered, there are merchants in Navea who specialize in collecting artifacts of archaeological importance.
#823$#If you dig up anything interesting, I'll be they'd take it off your hands for a good price.|
50085|#823$#The humans of old have gone to the great beyond. They can't spend mortal wealth, so you might as well benefit from it.
#821$#For example, I've heard you can exchange artifacts for fortification items. But...what is this "fortification"?|
50086|#821$#You can find ruins and other archaeological sites in almost every area of the world.
#821$#If you're looking for artifacts, it's best to go straight to the source!|
50091|What's the point of joining a guild?|
50092|What are your thoughts on guilds?|
50093|#821$#I've heard of these "guilds" - clandestine organizations where members gather together to plot assaults and eat ice cream...|
50094|#821$#Can I join a guild?
#824$#An Eidolon should be able to join a guild if they want to, I think.|
50095|#821$#I'm told that if a guild becomes prestigious enough, they'll gain their own tract of land.
#823$#What kind of place do you suppose it is? Is it as big as my palace?|
50096|#822$#I've heard guilds are a good place to get to know others.
#824$#Joining one could be nice, but for now, I'll take getting to know others one person at a time.|
50101|How do you meditate?|
50102|What's the secret to successful meditation?|
50103|#2$#It looks very serene, right? So serene that I've fallen asleep meditating before.
#822$#It's like my own mind betrayed itself!|
50104|#821$#Whatever you do, don't fall asleep while meditating. If you do, people might try to draw things on your face.|
50105|#821$#You know, whenever I meditate...
#824$#My little birdie here will just quietly fall asleep.|
50106|#821$#Before meditating, you should clear the area of clutter and distractions.
#824$That way, your mind won't become fixated on what's around you.|
50111|Your pet is so cute!|
50112|What's your pet's name?|
50113|#824$#She doesn't like being called a pet, honestly - says she prefers to be known as my "valued and esteemed partner".|
50114|#822$#She says "I'm a deity! How could you call me a pet!"|
50115|#821$#Sometimes I think it'd be fun to have a pet.
#824$#But if I had one, my friend here would think I wasn't giving her enough attention!|
50116|#824$#I've raised Suzaku here since she was just  a little chicklet.
#821$#She might seem kind of weird...and maybe a little lumpy,
#823$#But before you, she was my only real companion.|
50121|Are you not really the talkative type?|
50122|You're always so quiet.|
50123|#824$#I'm not sure I get the question.
#821$#Is there something I'm misunderstanding?|
50124|#821$#Well, you know what they say - "Something something, blah blah, speak no evil!"
#823$#Now, how did the rest of that go? It sounded so wise when I heard it...|
50125|#821$#Where I'm from, I don't get many visitors - not even other spirits.
#824$#I suppose I still feel a bit awkward with conversation, but don't give up on me!|
50126|#823$#You seem to be able to talk to anyone. Maybe I should be asking for YOUR secret.
#821$#Can you teach me how to talk to anyone with bold confidence?|
50131|If you could have one wish granted....|
50132|What's your greatest wish?|
50133|#821$I wish to take to the sky; to just soar at amazing speeds and feel lighter than air.
#823$I could sail through the sky all day and never come down.|
50134|#821$#It would be super great if I could stop drooling every time I fall asleep...
#822$#Oh crappers, you weren't supposed to know about that!|
50135|#821$#I'd like to see others be at peace with themselves, and with others.
#823$#If you've got that, you can make remarkable strides as an individual.|
50136|#823$#Me and the fuzzball love adventuring with you!
#821$#Tacky as it might sound, I'm living my dream right now.|
50141|Tell me a secret or two about the other Eidolons.|
50142|Can you tell me some interesting Eidolon facts?|
50143|#821$#I have known Vayu for a very long time.
#824$#But each time we meet, we seem to get into a spat. I guess even the sky isn't big enough for the both of us.|
50144|#821$#Spending time with Nalani puts my mind at ease.
#823$#She's like a deep wellspring of peaceful vibes that leaves anyone she talks to feeling refreshed.|
50145|#821$#Yarnaros has such a booming voice! When he speaks, it always catches me off-guard.
#821$#At least he has interesting things to say, though! It would truly be a curse to be both booming and boring.|
50146|#824$#It doesn't seem like Bel-Chandra likes me much.
#821$#Ever since I became interested in dancing, I think she sees me as "the competition".|
50151|Where do you come from?|
50152|Where do you live?|
50153|#823$#My palace floats high in the Southern Skies, though you'd have to travel to the realm of spirits to see it.
#821$#Few venture there, aside from those of my tribe.|
50154|#821$#The palace that is my home rises above the clouds. It shimmers in the sunsets like a fiery mountain.|
50155|#822$#I come from the Southern Sky. Even in the realm of spirits, where distances are harder to calculate, it is quite remote.|
50156|#824$#I live in a palace, of course. I'm enjoying my time out in the world, but I think my little friend here misses her nest.|
50161|What style of martial arts do you study?|
50162|What makes your martial art style unique?|
50163|#823$#The full name is the "Southern Phoenix Radiant Ascending Fist"
#821$#That's kind of long, so I just call it the Phoenix Fist Style.|
50164|#821$#I've tempered my martial art style around the idea that I'm not hurting enemies so much as I'm saving allies.|
50165|#823$#I mix a lot of my attacks with fire, as I'm sure you've noticed.
#821$#That's a phoenix for you - the flame of death is also the flame of rebirth!|
50166|#821$#Maaaaybe if you stick with me long enough, I'll teach you a few things.
#822$#But always remember: knowing a martial art is a responsibility, not just for looking really cool - though that IS a nice side-effect.|
50171|Your outfit looks really good on you.|
50172|Tell me about your outfit.|
50173|#824$#I decorated this outfit with feathers donated by members of the phoenix tribe.
#821$#It's quite fetching, don't you think?|
50174|#821$#It's a surprisingly comfortable outfit.
#823$#Loose enough in all the right places, and snug enough in all the right places.
|
50175|#823$#When I created these clothes, I was inspired by martial arts clothing and dancewear.
#821$#It allows freedom of movement while still showing off all my best plumage.|
50176|#823$#Oooh, is that a compliment?
#821$#I'm glad you like it! I put lots of thought into the design.|
50181|You're always with that bird.|
50182|Do you and your bird have a special connection?|
50183|#824$#This little gal had no one to hatch her, so I hatched her egg myself.
#821$#We've been with each other so long that we can understand each other's feelings without words.|
50184|#824$#Sometimes I get so absorbed in everything going on around me, but when I look at my friend, I remember where I come from and why I'm here.|
50185|#821$#She looks so adorable, you know, but in reality, she's proud and a bit sensitive, as phoenixes tend to be.
#822$#Only I can call her a fuzzball without retribution!|
50186|#821$#She's my only real family. Well...before I had you, anyway.
#823$#She's been enjoying this journey a lot, just as I have.|
50191|If we had to part ways, what would you do next?|
50192|If we were to separate one day, what would your plans be?|
50193|#824$#I suppose I would continue exploring this mortal realm with my little friend.|
50194|#821$#You've been so kind, taking me along, teaching me all kinds of things about this realm.
#824$#Even if we were to part, I would never forget your kindness...|
50195|#821$#There's so much sorrow in this world.
#823$#I think I might like to keep traveling and helping others, putting a smile on many faces.|
50196|#821$#We've had our good times and bad times, but I'd miss them all if we parted ways.|
50301|How do you like to spend your leisure time?|
50302|What do you do when you have free time?|
50303|#823$# Oho, are you implying we ought to spend more time together?
#821$# I shall be content as long as you appreciate a good song and story.|
50304|#822$#I... prefer not to be left alone with my thoughts.
#824$# Idling away in the cold robs one of warmth.|
50305|#821$# When you're resting, I often compose new poems and songs.
#822$# I'm thinking of writing a ballad based on our piraresque adventures.|
50306|#821$# In order to keep my panoply of skills honed, I often practice them when I have no other pressing matters.|
50311|What's your favorite season?|
50312|Which season do you like best?|
50313|#824$# When winter's chill has run its course, the winds of spring paint the land with color. I look forward to that season each year.|
50314|#821$# I hail from the northerly realms, where winter's grip seldom fades.
#823$# That is why experiencing spring, summer, and autumn here is quite inspiring.|
50315|#822$# Despite the frozen nature of my powers, I do not particularly like the winter.
#824$# Standing in the snow, looking ever to the gray horizon...it is a lonesome existence.|
50316|#821$# There is something about the vivacity of spring that has always held my fancy.
#823$# And what of you? Which season do you favor?|
50321|So...what's your type?|
50322|What kind of person do you find attractive?|
50323|#823$# Ara ara~ Looking at brave wanderers has sometimes filled my mind with improper notions.|
50324|#821$# One who will keep the vows they have made; one who will look into your eyes and not turn away.
#823$# From a person of that steadfastness I shall not turn away.|
50325|#824$# At times, I ponder whether I have lingered so long in the cold that my heart has frozen over.
#822$# Perhaps that is why I eagerly await the thaw of spring.|
50326|#823$# Ara ara~ It seems you're interested in more than simply poetry and song.
#821$# But now I am curious - what manner of person do YOU favor?|
50331|What do you think it means to have tenderness?|
50332|What is tenderness to you?|
50333|#821$# Tenderness encompasses being receptive to the feelings of one's partner.
#822$# Of course, allowing enemies to die a cold, peaceful death could also be said to be tender...|
50334|#821$# Be mindful - those that treat you with greatest tenderness and gentleness are not necessarily those with your best interest at heart.
#823$# Tenderness can be used subversively, to weaken one or cause one to lower one's guard.|
50335|#822$# Tenderness is more often found in deed than in appearance.
#821$# A woman with a visage frosty as snow may have a tender heart,
#824$# just as a man who burns with outward zeal may be cold as ice within.|
50336|#821$# The way you go out of your way to help others, even when it inconveniences you...
#823$# There is certinly something of tenderness in you, no?|
50341|What do you think about traveling?|
50342|Care to share your thoughts on traveling?|
50343|#821$# Traveling with you, I have met a colorful array of people in the mortal world.
#823$# It has been quite the educational experience - and of course, an amusing one.|
50344|#822$# When traveling, having companions is best.
#824$# To travel alone is a tiring affair.|
50345|#822$# Some who chase dreams head away to the frontiers in search of adventure, but most return to their hometown from time to time.
#824$# It gives me cause to wonder if you'll one day return, or if you'll live your life as a wanderer.|
50346|#821$# Though traveling alone can be tiring, it allows one the opportunity to truly know themselves.
#822$# Being alone in an unfamiliar environment will quickly show your strengths and weaknesses both.|
50351|What's special about the Oblitus Wood?|
50352|Could you tell me something about the Oblitus Wood?|
50353|#821$# Walking through those enchanted woods can make one forget their melancholy.
#823$# If you have any cares that rest greatly on your shoulders, perhaps you, too, can visit there.|
50354|#822$# I've heard that some traveler saw the silhouette of a demon deep within the woods.
#821$# Perhaps that is the cause of the forest's current condition...|
50355|#824$# The Oblitus Wood... I wonder if, perhaps, I have forgotten something within its depths...|
50356|#821$# I had heard tell from other spirits about the beauty those woods once possessed.
#822$# One day, when that forest returns to its former self, perhaps we may tarry in its shade.|
50361|Have you heard of the "Otherworld" Dungeons?|
50362|What do you know about these "Otherworld" places?|
50363|#821$# I have heard that some Eidolons hide themselves within these Otherworlds.
#822$# If you strike down the bosses within, perhaps you'll receive a challenge from an Eidolon.|
50364|#822$# The Otherworld is not unlike a separate dimension mirroring your own.
#821$# But where this world's energy is positive, the Otherworld's is negative. If you explore there, be wary.|
50365|#821$# The enemies who reside in the Otherworld are more difficult than you might think based on their appearances.
#823$# However, the rewards for defeating them are also proportionally greater. To the victor, the spoils, as they say.|
50366|#821$# The rhythm of the Otherworld is fixed, like the ticking of a clock.
#822$# If you can calculate when the dimension resets itself, you can challenge it when it is more convenient for you.|
50371|Tell me about Quests.|
50372|Do you have any info about Quests?|
50373|#822$# I've heard of an organization called the Mirabelle Group, which specializes in helping people in need.
#821$# As you may know, their clients pay well for the services of adventurers such as yourself.|
50374|#821$# If experience is what you seek, you will find quests well worth your time.
#823$# Many give notable rewards that would be of use on your journey.|
50375|#823$# I see you have no lack of enthusiasm when it comes to completing them, that is certain.|
50376|#821$# Some areas possess special "Daily Quests" for you to do.
#822$# Some are straightforward, some not, but most seem worth your while.|
50381|What do you think of Terra?|
50382|What can you tell me about Terra?|
50383|#824$# I have spent my life in the winter lands, so my knowledge of Terra is, unfortunately, limited.|
50384|#822$# It is said in the spirit realm that Terra was brought into being fully-formed by the Cube of Gaia.
#821$# To paint such varied landscapes, such diverse people - the Cube truly has a power beyond compare.|
50385|#821$# Most of Terra's races seem to have seen the benefits of peace, but as always, some warmongers yet remain.
#824$# These warlike tribes have been quite active as of late. One cannot help but feel that a greater conflict is inevitable.|
50386|#821$# Terra is a world unto itself, but it sits within the mortal realm.
#822$# The Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium likewise sit as antipodes in the realm of spirits.|
50391|I'd like to know about Dragon Points!|
50392|What can you tell me about Dragon Points?|
50393|#821$# The strong beasts of this world have within them the energy of Gaia.
#821$# If you strike them down, you will be able to accumulate this energy. "Points" are the traditional measurement for those who harvest this energy.
#823$# And when you've gathered enough energy, you can convert it into interesting items.|
50394|#821$# It is said that by defeating certain powerful monsters, the energy of Gaia within them will flow to you.
#822$# If you collect enough of this energy - these "points" - you can convert it into items.|
50395|#821$# Ah, those. They can be acquired by besting monsters in combat.
#823$# Fishermen have also said that defeating the Fish Kings around the world bestows such points.|
50396|#821$# I am given to wonder what kinds of rewards these points may be redeemed for. 'Tis a bit exciting to guess at!|
50401|Wow, your pet is really cute!|
50402|Is that your pet?|
50403|#821$# Oh, you noticed? Yes, this is my Pipe Fox, Momiji.
#822$# I brought him with me from the spirit realm's winter lands to keep me company in my travels.|
50404|#2$# Come on out, you naughty little thing. Don't be shy.|
50405|#821$# Ah, you must be referring to Momiji.
#822$# He's a small pipe fox - they're a rather shy sort around strangers. Normally, he stays curled up in my sleeves.|
50406|#823$# Momiji is a small pipe fox who accompanied me from the spirit realm. 
#822$# He's rather shy, so you don't see him poke his head out that often.|
50411|What special skills do you have?|
50412|What would you say is your best talent?|
50413|#821$# Of talents I have many - dancing, poetry, calligraphy, ice magic, singing, and I am often told I am quite the shamisen player.
#823$# Remind me later and I shall favor you with a fine folk-tune.|
50414|#821$# I know a dance, called "Cherry Blossoms Scattering Upon the Snowdrifts", that can entomb all those before me in solid ice. 'Tis quite the sight!|
50415|#822$# I have picked up a few skills here and there - being multifaceted is the hallmark of a good entertainer.
#2$# What would you say? Are you not entertained?|
50416|#821$# When one is snowed in by the storms of midwinter, one quickly learns how to spin an engaging tale.
#823$# With a fine story and a song, the hours can fly by, so I have found.|
50421|Wow, your skin is really pale.|
50422|Do you have to keep out of the sun to stay so pale?|
50423|#823$# Oh? Do you think the pallor of my skin draws attention?
#822$# Though you are far from the first to admire my complexion, I am pleased you seem to find it appealing.|
50424|#822$# I grew up amidst the ice and snow - naturally, I tend toward being pale. Don't be too passionate, or I just might melt away!
#823$# Ahaha, is that a blush I see?|
50425|#821$# In truth, I would like to enjoy the warmth of the sun.
#823$# However, when one produces one's own snowstorms, that prospect becomes difficult...|
50426|#824$# Snow-white skin to tanned bronze - there are many shades, and people who delight in each. So have we all our tastes.|
50431|Could you sing a song for me?|
50432|I'd like to hear you sing.|
50433|#821$#Ara ara~ Quite the affectionate request today, no?
#823$# What would happen if you were moved to tears by my song?|
50434|#824$# Gladly would I oblige, but I am...hesitant.
#822$# At times my song is as a siren's, lulling people to a final, quiet rest upon the snow.|
50435|#821$# When I play my shamisen and sing, wind and snow oft accompany the performance.
#824$# As such, most of my entertaining is done out of doors. Be sure to dress warmly!|
50436|#824$# When I sing, I sometimes think of those who loved my songs in times past, who are now gone. It is a melancholy reflection, as you might expect.|
50441|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
50442|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
50443|#822$# Do you know of Kaiser Zeta? The spirits say his soul is full of burning justice.
#821$# Quite a passionate individual, it would seem - apparently, he tries to teach energetic youths the power of 'combining'.|
50444|#824$# Vermilion makes her dwelling far in the southerly lands of the spirit realm. She seems an erudite soul - I would like to take tea with her someday.|
50445|#822$# It's said that in her mortal life, Cleopawtra ruled over an expansive desert kingdom.
#824$# Do you think the traces of that empire can still be found somewhere in this world?|
50446|#823$# Tsubaki just exudes style and flair with her choice of outfit!
#821$# I wish I could try on her garments someday...|
50451|What's your hometown like?|
50452|Tell me a bit about where you're from.|
50453|#821$# I hail from the Winter Lands, in the northerly reaches of the spirit realm. All year long, the snow does not depart from them.|
50454|#823$# As you can tell, I am from the far north.
#822$# When I first appeared in your world, every type of weather felt hot - I was sweating even on nice days!|
50455|#821$# I and my pet Momiji came from a land of ice and snow.
#2$# Yet, oddly enough, he still dislikes the cold. I think he has grown attached to these balmier climes.|
50456|#824$# Although my homeland is ever-blanketed in white, I pray for the kiss of spring to alight upon it one day...|
50461|You sure do like that umbrella, huh?|
50462|What's so special about your umbrella?|
50463|#824$# I promised someone dear to me that, when he returned from his wandering, I would welcome him under this same umbrella.|
50464|#821$# This umbrella is one of my most treasured belongings.
#822$# Wherever I travel, I always take it with me.|
50465|#821$# When one lives in a land of year-round winter, one quickly comes to appreciate a quality umbrella.
#822$# It would not do to have my clothes dampened by snow, would it?|
50466|#822$# The cherry blossoms on my umbrella serve as a reminder.
#824$# They remind me of my desire to see the cherry trees in my hometown blossom one day.|
50471|Sometimes it looks like something's got you down...|
50472|Did something sad happen in your past?|
50473|#821$# I do appreciate your concern for my well-being. Right now, I am doing fine.|
50474|#822$# Oh? It must just be the paleness of my face. Do not be worried for my sake.|
50475|#824$# I was thinking of how I once made a promise... A promise that could only be fulfilled when spring comes to my homeland.|
50476|#824$# I...do not feel like discussing the past right now. Perhaps at a later time...|
50481|Do you have friends you really trust?|
50482|Who's your best friend?|
50483|#824$# Where I come from, I have fans of my music, and many admirers besides, but sadly, none I can call a friend...|
50484|#823$# Other than Momiji here...just you, I suppose.
#2$# At least one of you doesn't constantly crawl around inside my clothes.|
50485|#821$# I was closest to my pipe fox, Momiji - so I brought him with me when I came here.
#2$# See? He seems quite pleased with your realm.|
50486|#823$# Acquaintences without number, yes, but there are few I would call "friends".
#821$# And yourself? I would like to meet your friends someday.|
50491|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
50492|What would you do if we separated?|
50493|#822$# I have always known that one day we would have to say goodbye, but I will not forget your many kindnesses to me.
#824$# I would hope that you, too, keep a warm memory of me in your heart, in spite of my cold.|
50494|#821$# When we must say our last goodbyes, I will dance an ancient dance of prayer for you,
#824$# so that the will of the spirits might always look kindly upon your path.|
50495|#824$# Even if we are separated, I will think of you whenever I sing the ballad I wrote chronicling our adventures.|
50496|#824$# I will wait for the day when warm breezes bring the touch of spring to my homeland. Such a day will be a day of rejoicing for me.|
50601|What is your dream?|
50602|Do you have a dream?|
50603|#824$#Don't be afraid if I tell you...
#821$# My dream is to fly to the sun, and get as close as I can to the Aura Kingdom!|
50604|#821$# Of course I have dreams! People have to have dreams!|
50605|#821$# My dream almost came true once. I was so close to the sun I could almost touch it...
#824$# But then I heard an alarm: "Warning! System Overheating! Catastrophic Failure!"
#821$#The sun's heat nearly destroyed me, and my former master fell and died.|
50606|#821$# Flying! I want to soar through the sky, and feel the unbearable heat of the sun!|
50611|Who do you have feelings for?|
50612|Who do you like?|
50613|#821$# That kind of pointless thing means nothing to me. My dream trumps all!|
50614|#824$# Is this more important than my dream? If not, why are we still talking about it?|
50615|#822$# I like you! You're my companion, so of course I like you!|
50616|#821$# Until my dream comes true, I'd rather not talk about it.|
50621|What is your favorite food?|
50622|What do you normally eat?|
50623|#821$# C'mon! Use your brain!
#824$# Look at me! Do you really think I still need to eat?|
50624|#821$# Before I became like this, I liked Crispy Roasted Chicken and Flavorful Herbal Tea!
#822$# Sadly, if I eat those now, my robot body will be damaged.
#821$# But hey, even if I'm just a robot, it's still good to be alive.|
50625|#821$# In my current state, I can only eat things like Eidolon XP Crystals.
#821$# If I eat anything else, I might end up in a repair shop.
#824$# Maybe someday I can be made into a robot that can eat real food...|
50626|#821$# My favorite food is... people!
#822$# Ha! Relax, I'm just messing with you. Why would I eat people?
#823$# You should have seen how scared you looked!|
50631|What's your favorite season?|
50632|Which season do you like best?|
50633|#821$# They're pretty much the same to me, though I do hate rain.
#824$# It's not that big of a deal, but until I get more waterproof parts, I may get rusty if I get too wet.
#821$# I might as well be dead if I'm too rusty to move!|
50634|#821$# Real men don't care what season it is.|
50635|#824$# I can't feel heat or cold, so the seasons are all pretty much the same to me.|
50636|#824$# Why should I care what season it is? I just live my life.
#821$# I spend every day working toward my dreams!|
50641|Do you have a favorite animal?|
50642|What do you think of animals?|
50643|#821$# I like hawks. The way they soar through the sky is a sight to behold!|
50644|#821$# Promise you won't laugh... I kinda like little birds.
#824$# Though it does bother me a bit when they build their nests on my body...|
50645|#821$# I like strong animals! Why? Because strong means more meat!
#823$# I was kidding. You should've seen the look on your face!|
50646|#821$# I used to keep small animals, like squirrels and foxes, as pets...
#824$# But I don't keep pets anymore - it's too hard to wash their hair.|
50651|Have you heard of the Aura Kingdom?|
50652|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
50653|#824$# I've heard the Aura Kingdom is different from Terra. For one thing, it's unrestrained by the shackles of time.
#821$# The angels don't get old - they look the same forever.|
50654|#824$# The Aura Kingdom... That's somewhere humans can never go.
#821$# My dream is to fly to the sun, and get as close as I can to the Aura Kingdom!|
50655|#824$# No one from Terra has ever been to the Aura Kingdom. Even angels who come to Terra by mistake can't go back.
#821$# You shouldn't have such unrealistic dreams, they'll only make you sad.|
50656|#824$# The Aura Kingdom is said to be beautiful. The trees stay green forever, and the flowers never die.
#821$# Wait, trees that stay green? Those sound like artificial trees! My old man used to make those!|
50661|What can you tell me about the Avians?|
50662|I'd like to know more about the Avians.|
50663|#821$# A foolish race that gave up flying!|
50664|#821$# They could've flown, but they chose to walk on their feet!
#824$# Stupid, stupid! They don't deserve their wings!|
50665|#821$# Sad creatures... they have wings, but have forgotten how to fly.|
50666|#821$# Avians? They can't fly and have bad tempers. What are you asking about them for?|
50671|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
50672|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
50673|#824$# Everyone says the Cube of Gaia created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium, but who was the first to say it?
#821$# Don't you think people's beliefs about the Cube of Gaia are a bit strange?|
50674|#821$# It's just a cube, yet it creates life.
#821$# Don't you find that magical?|
50675|#821$# The Cube of Gaia saved my life once.
#824$# I don't remember it, but my dad told me that, when I was young, I was gravely injured in an accident.
#821$# He used the cube's energy and his mechanical skills to save me. That's how I became what I am today.|
50676|#821$# The Cube of Gaia created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium, as well as all the creatures living in those realms.
#821$# But where did this all-powerful cube come from? No one knows.|
50681|What's the point of joining a guild?|
50682|What are your thoughts on guilds?|
50683|#821$# Well, you get to to fight alongside like-minded people. Just thinking about it makes me excited!|
50684|#821$# Each guild has its own Hall, where you can find various merchants.
#821$# Also, strangely, various Eidolons will appear frequently in the Guild Halls.
#824$# I don't get it, showing up just to be beaten. Who knows what those Eidolons are thinking?|
50685|#821$# There's also a Guild Warehouse in each Guild Hall. You can use it as a trash can.
#822$# If someone has a problem with that, just tell them I told you it was okay to throw trash there. Haha!|
50686|#821$# Traveling alone is boring. If you join a guild, you'll have more friends.|
50691|I'd like to know more about Dragon Points.|
50692|What can you tell me about Dragon Points?|
50693|#821$# Well, it's just another name for the energy of the Cube of Gaia.|
50694|#824$# How could you not know about that? Go bother someone else with these dumb questions!|
50695|#821$# Once you collect enough Dragon Points, you can create certain items.
#821$# Creating something from nothing - ain't that amazing!|
50696|#821$# Stronger creatures have the Cube of Gaia's energy in them. And this type of energy is called Dragon Points.|
50701|You weren't always a robot. What happened?|
50702|How did you become a robot?|
50703|#821$# Well, this is my dad's greatest creation! He built me like this with help from the Power of Gaia.
#821$# But why a robot? You'll have to ask my dad about that.
#824$# After all, I was dying when it happened, so I didn't have much of a say in the matter.|
50704|#824$# The last thing that I do remember is the system warning: "System Overheating! Catastrophic Failure!"
#821$#After my master died, I was so sad. I gave up on life, and nearly died too.
#821$# But with help from the Power of Gaia, my master's memories and behavior patterns were cloned, and I regained the will to live.|
50705|#824$# Well... it was an accident. I don't remember it, I've only heard about it from my dad.
#821$# He told me that I was dying. My injury was so severe that it couldn't be cured.
#821$# He used the cube's energy and his mechanical skill to build this body for me.|
50706|#821$# Long story short... there was an accident.|
50711|Do you ever need to rest?|
50712|Do you ever need to sleep?|
50713|#821$# Not really - but out of habit, I still take a nap every day.|
50714|#824$# I suppose I could live without sleeping, but it would be very strange.|
50715|#821$# C'mon! Use your brain!
#824$# Look at me! Do you really think I still need to sleep?|
50716|#822$# Have you ever seen a sleeping robot? What a dumb question! Haha!|
50721|Daedalus is a famous architect!|
50722|Daedalus is a famous inventor!|
50723|#821$# My old man is amazing! Have you heard of Minotaurus's labyrinth? My dad built it!|
50724|#821$# Of course he is! He also built my robot body.
#821$# A perfect combination of the Power of Gaia and mechanical skill saved my life. How many people could do what my dad did?|
50725|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$# ...He has a wealth of knowledge, innovative ideas, and the ability to put those ideas into action.
#821$# I was created to help my master achieve his dreams.|
50726|#821$# It's true! Thanks for speaking highly of my dad.|
50731|What do you think of Minotaurus?|
50732|Do you know Minotaurus?|
50733|#824$# Before I met him, I thought he was just a weirdo with horns.
#821$# But later I found out he and I actually have a lot in common. Hahaha!|
50734|#824$# You mean the guy who paid my dad a fortune to build a labyrinth?
#821$# I don't get it. Who'd want to live in a labyrinth? Isn't he afraid he'll get lost in his own home?
#821$# After all, my dad built that labyrinth, and even he almost got lost in there!|
50735|#824$# I heard that Minotaurus doesn't allow anyone to ride on his back... which really makes me want to try it.|
50736|#821$# Word has it that Minotaurus has his own army inside the labyrinth...
#822$# I wonder if they ever get lost in there. That would be funny!|
50741|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
50742|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
50743|#821$# Don't underestimate Alucard just because he looks frail. He's actually a dragon!
#821$# I once saw him turn into a dragon and take flight - that was truly amazing!|
50744|#824$# Aelius is the God of the Sun... But since Aelius is here with us, who's the sun in the sky?|
50745|#821$# Bealdor is the God of Light and Aelius is the God of the Sun...
#824$# Doesn't the sun bring the light? What exactly is the difference between them?|
50746|#821$# I heard that Shirayuki lives in the Winter Lands, where it's always snowing.
#821$# I've never seen snow before. I hope I can see it someday!|
50751|Do you miss Daedalus?|
50752|I heard Daedalus misses you a lot.|
50753|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$# ...Even though I contain my master's memories and behavior patterns human feelings are foreign to me.
#821$# Missing someone... I could never understand this feeling, nor have I ever felt it.|
50754|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$# ...Missing someone? I'm afraid I do not know this feeling.
#821$# But I do sometimes replay Daedalus's videos. Is that what you'd call "missing?"|
50755|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$ ...Daedalus misses my master's memories and behavior patterns, not me...
#824$# Am I sad? I think you misinterpret - these aren't tears, it's just machine oil...|
50756|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$#¡K My chip seems to be partially damaged, so the videos of Daedalus sometimes play automatically even when I don't want to.
#824$# You call this "missing"? I don't think so. It's just a damaged chip. I'd never have human's feelings.|
50761|Do you cry?|
50762|Have you ever cried?|
50763|#821$# Real men don't cry. I wouldn't mind bleeding, but I'll never cry!|
50764|#824$# These aren't tears. They're... what do you call it... cleaning fluid?|
50765|#821$# I was a very bad kid. And I used to cry my eyes out when my dad yelled at me!
#824$# But now? I'm a man, for god's sake! 
#821$# And even if I did cry I'd never tell anyone - it would be so humiliating.|
50766|#821$# Speaking of which, the only time I saw my dad cry was when I nearly died.
#821$# When I woke up, he didn't know how to react, but soon he started crying.
#824$# Maybe those were happy tears? I'm not sure, but I have a feeling they were.|
50771|Why were you created?|
50772|Why did Daedalus create you?|
50773|#824$# Create? Oh, you mean my body.
#821$# To save my life! My old body was destroyed; only my brain was intact.
#821$# I gotta hand it to my dad - saving me when I was in that condition. Haha!|
50774|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$ ...My former master's dream was to fly to the sun and get as close as possible to the Aura Kingdom!
#824$# Daedalus created me to help my master achieve his dreams.|
50775|#822$# Haha! That's an interesting way to put it. But you may be right - I was basically "created" by my dad.|
50776|#821$# You're right! Giving birth is also a kind of creation.|
50781|What type of energy do you run on?|
50782|Do you need to recharge your energy?|
50783|#821$# Must you ask? The Cube of Gaia's energy, of course!|
50784|#821$# You forgot what my dad used to make me? It was the Cube of Gaia!|
50785|#821$# Haha! Don't underestimate me - I have the Cube of Gaia's energy inside me!
#824$# If the Cube's energy runs out, I'm afraid I'll shut down permanently.|
50786|#821$# You've gotta hand it to my dad - not everyone could have harnessed the Cube of Gaia's energy.
#821$# The Cube created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium, so imagine how powerful it is!
#821$# I'm pretty sure you don't need to worry about my energy running out.|
50791|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
50792|What would you do if we separated?|
50793|#822$# Haha! Don't you worry...
#821$# Even if we part ways, I'm sure we'll meet again someday!|
50794|#821$# To pursue my dream! That's the whole point of living!|
50795|#821$# Have you heard the saying "we'll cross that bridge when we come to it"?
#821$# Let's not worry about that yet, it won't do us any good.|
50796|#821$# I'd love to visit my dad... I wonder if his hair has turned grey.|
50901|Do you like to travel?|
50902|How do you feel about traveling?|
50903|#821$# I love traveling, and looking at all the beautiful scenery!
#822$# I like traveling as much as I like you!|
50904|#822$# I like traveling, but sometimes I can't find my way back to Hellheim.
#821$# Gram used to find me when I got lost...
#824$# I miss him so much...|
50905|#821$# Aren't we traveling right now? Or would you not call this traveling?
#823$# Or maybe... Is this what my brother would call eloping?|
50906|#822$# I love traveling with you!
#821$# What about you? Do you like traveling with me?|
50911|What kind of person do you like?|
50912|What kind of person would you want to date?|
50913|#821$# My oldest brother wants me to date someone smart; my second-oldest brother wants me to date someone strong; and my father says...
#824$# He says... actually he's said a lot of things... I can't remember them now.
#821$# But my second oldest brother told me that I should just ignore my dad. So I guess that only leaves the first two conditions.|
50914|#823$#Gram says he'll find me whenever I get lost and take me back to Hellheim, 
#821$# he also says he'll convince my dad and my brothers, 
#821$# he also says... Huh? You don't want to hear any more? But there's still so much I want to tell you...|
50915|#821$# I like Gram, and my two brothers... My father? Uh...
#824$# If my my father gave me more freedom, I'd like him more.
#822$# Ah, I also like you! You're like my big brother!|
50916|#821$# Hmm... The things I like are shiny and cold...
#821$# You mean the people I like? I like snowmen!|
50921|What's your favorite color?|
50922|Any preferences about color?|
50923|#821$# Black, red, yellow, purple... I like them all...
#823$# But my favorite color is shining gold!|
50924|#2$# Well... Should I dye myself so we're the same color?
#821$# Your face looks so red. Are you unwell?
#824$# My second-oldest brother said that this would make you happy. He didn't tell me that you might get sick.|
50925|#822$# What color do I like? I like your color!|
50926|#821$# Uhh... Let's just say I do NOT like your color...
#824$# It kinda reminds me of my second-oldest brother's vomit. I don't like it.|
50931|What's your favorite season?|
50932|Which season do you like best?|
50933|#821$# We don't have seasons in Hellheim. The weather is always the same...|
50934|#823$# I like all four seasons in Terra, and their different sceneries.
#821$# Flowers in spring, summer breezes, falling leaves in autumn and snow in winter - I like them all!|
50935|#823$# Gram always hated winter.
#821$# A lot of people die every winter, so it's always busy.
#821$# Gram always complains about how much he works in the winter.|
50936|#823$ Hmm... My second-oldest brother also hates winter.
#821$# He says that he always feel exhausted during winter - all he wants to do is go find a warm place to sleep.|
50941|Do you have a favorite animal?|
50942|What do you think of animals?|
50943|#821$# I like deer, wild boars and pheasant - they're all delicious!
#821$# Oh, you didn't mean to eat? Then what was your question again?|
50944|#821$# Gram once had a huge ox twice his size.
#824$# Then, one day, my oldest brother came to visit, and we never saw the ox again.
#821$# I still remember how happy my oldest brother was that day.|
50945|#2$# If you were my pet, I could discipline you...
#821$# Not interested? But my second-oldest brother told me it would make you happy...|
50946|#821$# Gram once had a beautiful golden python.
#824$# Then, one day, my second-oldest brother came to visit, and we never saw the python again.
#821$# My second-oldest brother was so angry when he left.|
50951|What's the Sky Tower like?|
50952|Have you heard of the Sky Tower?|
50953|#821$# It's the tallest building in Navea. Word is, it has 100 floors!|
50954|#822$# I wonder what it's like inside the Sky Tower. Let's go have a look together!|
50955|#821$# I hear that there's a mystical potion at the very top of the Sky Tower that can cure any illness.
#823$# I never thought humans could make such an amazing potion. I'm impressed!|
50956|#821$# Hmm... I've heard there's lots of weapons and armor inside the Sky Tower.
#821$# If you want some new equipment, you should go have a look!|
50961|What's the Cube of Gaia?|
50962|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
50963|#821$# You don't know? The Cube of Gaia is what created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium.|
50964|#823$# I don't know... You should ask Gram, I'm sure he knows.
#824$# ¡K Ah, I forgot again... Gram is gone...|
50965|#821$# The Cube of Gaia created everything. So it's fair to say the cube is the mother of all of us...
#822$# If you think about it that way, you and I are siblings!|
50966|#821$# Lots of people want to use the Cube of Gaia's power for evil...
#823$# Just like the other Envoy of Gaia you were chasing, remember?
#821$# It was that guy with white hair who always wears black and rides a black horse!|
50971|What's the Mirabelle Group?|
50972|Have you heard of the Mirabelle Group?|
50973|#821$# Hmm... If I recall correctly, the Mirabelle Group is a "problem-solving" agency.|
50974|#821$# There are Mirabelle Group Bulletin Boards in nearly every town and village.
#821$# If you're feeling up to it, you should help out some people in need!|
50975|#821$# Hmm... All the Mirabelle Group's customers seem to be young humans... 
#821$# That used to give me the impression that young humans were frail and helpless. But now, I know that's not the case!|
50976|#824$# Uh... I remember Gram once said...
#821$# The Mirabelle Group is an agency that "dumps" people's problems onto other people...
#824$# That's not true? But Gram told me so...|
50981|What's "Connecting to Gaia"?|
50982|What purpose does "Connecting to Gaia" serve?|
50983|#821$# Hmm... According to Gram, it involves me asking the Cube of Gaia for gifts.|
50984|#824$# Connecting to Gaia is a wonderful feeling. Mmm... I don't know how to explain it...
#821$# Once you become an Eidolon you'll see for yourself!|
50985|#2$# What, do you want to connect to me?
#821$# Eh? Your nose is bleeding... Is blood the present the Cube of Gaia gave you?|
50986|#821$# "Connecting to Gaia" is achieving resonance with the Cube of Gaia and creating items from the cube's energy.
#824$# But, sadly, I never get what I want...|
50991|What's "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
50992|Have you heard of "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
50993|#824$# Gram told me once. Let me think...
#821$# ... Oh, right! He said "Tanuki Turmoil" is when humans get involved in the affairs of mice, instead of minding their own business.|
50994|#821$# Uhh... If I recall correctly, it's two different groups of mice fighting over giant corn.
#823$# The huge, golden corn always looks so beautiful. I bet it's also delicious!|
50995|#821$# Not just Gram, but also my second-oldest brother, said that!
#821$# He said, "If I could just try that corn, all my troubles would cease."|
50996|#822$# I'm not sure... Why don't you check it out and see for yourself!|
51001|Who's Gram?|
51002|Tell me about Gram.|
51003|#821$# Gram is family. He's the person I love most. Then it's my second-oldest brother, then my oldest brother and my father.|
51004|#821$# Gram was always there for me, even after I went to Hellheim.
#824$# I thought it would be always like that - Gram and me together. But he's gone...
#824$# I miss him so much...|
51005|#821$# It's not just me - my brothers also like Gram.
#823$# Every time they come visit, they hang out with him a lot!
#821$# It's strange, though - Gram always looks so tired after they leave.|
51006|#821$# Gram is actually a sword, but in the form of a dragon.
#821$# But, sword or dragon, it doesn't matter: Gram is family to me and I love him the most!|
51011|What's Hellheim like?|
51012|Tell me about Hellheim.|
51013|#821$# It's a land of lost souls. It's dark and gloomy. I doubt humans would like it much...
#821$# Even I didn't like it at first... Luckily, I got Gram for company.|
51014|#821$# Picture the darkest, gloomiest and most desolate place you can imagine - that's Hellheim.|
51015|#821$# It's a gloomy and desolate place with nothing to see.
#823$# But regardless, Hellheim is my home, and I like it there.|
51016|#821$# Hmm... According to Gram, it's just a desolate wasteland of bones.|
51021|Do you know Bealdor?|
51022|Bealdor always wanted to meet you.|
51023|#824$# Bealdor... If I hadn't met him, maybe Gram wouldn't be...|
51024|#821$# The God of Light? Of course I know him!
#824$# After all, everyone loves the light and hates darkness...|
51025|#824$# Bealdor... I'm not sure if I should see him again.
#824$# I just miss Gram so much...|
51026|#824$# If I could turn back time, maybe... maybe I would do things differently...|
51031|Can dead people be revived?|
51032|Can you revive a dead person?|
51033|#821$# Whoever or whatever you are, dead is dead. Nothing can change that.|
51034|#823$# Hmm... I remember it clearly: some lost souls were complaining about being dead. Gram scolded them harshly...
#821$# He yelled, "Shut the hell up and get back in line, or I'll make you suffer!"
#823$# I still remember how well those lost souls behaved after that...|
51035|#821$# Well, being alive again is out of the question, but you can still live in Hellheim, which isn't so bad...
#822$# When the time comes, I'll find you a nice spot in Hellheim!|
51036|#821$# Hmm... if Gram is right and we can be revived, what do we need Hellheim for??|
51041|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
51042|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
51043|#821$# Vayu and Gram look so alike... Only Vayu is whiter... 
#822$# Hmm... Do you know where we could find some black dye?|
51044|#821$# Alucard and Vayu are both dragons, but they look so different.
#823$# I guess I like Vayu better, because he looks like Gram!|
51045|#821$# I like Endora... Her blonde hair is amazing!
#821$# Justine is also super-cute. Too bad Endora never lets me touch her...|
51046|#821$# Shirayuki, from the Winter Lands? I wonder how she tastes...
#823$# Maybe like a snowman?|
51051|I heard you have two brothers?|
51052|Do you have any siblings?|
51053|#821$# I have three brothers: the oldest is Fenrir, the second-oldest is Jormungand, and Gram is like a brother as well!|
51054|#821$# Fenrir loves training with Gram. But every time they do, they leave Hellheim a mess.
#823$# Fortunately, Jormungand always shows up and makes sure Fenrir cleans up.
#821$# Jormungand is the best! Whenever Fenrir gets into trouble, Jormungand is there for him.|
51055|#821$# And don't forget Gram - he's also my brother.
#821$# Gram always says he's just a servant. But in my heart, he is my brother!|
51056|#823$# Sometimes I wish I had a sister too...
#821$# Don't let my two brothers know about that... They might get upset.|
51061|You and crows both like shiny things.|
51062|Why do you and crows share the same interest?|
51063|#821$# An Eidolon once made similar comments...
#823$# My two brothers happened to hear the comments, and invited him over for a chat. 
#821$# Strangely, I haven't seen that Eidolon since...|
51064|#824$# Sadly, there are no crows in Hellheim... 
#821$# Could crows be the same as carrion birds? But carrion birds don't like shiny things...|
51065|#821$# I feel a strange kinship with crows.
#823$# I have lots of shiny things I could share with them!|
51066|#822$# Shiny things are the best! Don't you agree?|
51071|What are the duties of the Netherworld Queen?|
51072|What does the Netherworld Queen do?|
51073|#821$# Hmm... Manage Hellheim, deal with the Lost Souls, serve the oldest and second-oldest brothers, go out and enjoy the view...
#823$# Uh, I think the last few don't count. Oops!|
51074|#824$# Sigh... the lost souls are always so dark and gloomy. They're not pretty at all.
#821$# Watching at lost souls all day is pretty boring.|
51075|#821$# When Gram was around, I'd just go for a walk and he'd find me.
#824$# But Gram is gone. I really miss him...|
51076|#824$# Hellheim without Gram is so big and gloomy...|
51081|You're pretty skilled!|
51082|What sort of training do you do?|
51083|#821$# Normally, Gram helps me train.
#821$# I don't know why, but every time we train, he always wears a lot of heavy-looking equipment.
#823$# I always help him take off the equipment after we're done, and he always looks at me gratefully.|
51084|#824$# I used to have Gram to train with. Sadly, he's gone now...|
51085|#821$# At first, I trained with my second-oldest brother. After awhile he got too busy, so I trained with my oldest brother.
#821$# But then my oldest brother also said he was too busy, so I started training with Gram.
#823$#Well, even though my brothers are both busy, they still visit me a lot!|
51086|#821$# Sigh... my brothers are even more skilled than I am!
#821$# Every time we train together, they always let me win. I think they just do it to make me happy.
#823$# They've always been so nice to me. I love them both!|
51091|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
51092|What would you do if we separated?|
51093|#821$# Hmm... Go back to Hellheim? I don't know...|
51094|#821$# Don't worry, I'm sure we will meet again.
#822$# Why? Because all dead people come to Hellheim. I will be waiting for you.|
51095|#821$# I have to visit my second-oldest brother first, then my oldest brother.
#824$# My father? He has so many rules - you can't wear this, you can't sit like that, you can't this and that...
#823$# Maybe I'll visit my father next time...|
51096|#821$# Leaving... like how Gram left me? Forever?
#824$# I don't know... I really don't know...|
51201|What's your favorite color?|
51202|What's your favorite color?|
51203|#823$# Definitely the bright ones. Come on, I'm the God of Light!|
51204|#821$# I used to hate darkness, until I met her...
#821$# She made me stop hating the darkness, and I even started liking it.
#824$# But she never visits me anymore...|
51205|#821$# Color? I like your color.
#822$# What? No, no! I just like it, it has nothing to do with you! I repeat, it's not because of you!|
51206|#821$# Uh... I don't really love or hate any color. How about you?
#822$# Don't get me wrong, I was just asking. Not... not because I care about you!|
51211|Do you like to travel?|
51212|What do you think about traveling?|
51213|#821$# If I didn't like traveling, why would I be traveling with you...?
#822$# I... I meant I like traveling for its own sake. No, not you! Only the traveling!|
51214|#821$# Traveling... I've promised someone I'll travel the world with her.
#824$# But it feels like that day may never come...|
51215|#821$# I always thought traveling was dangerous... My mother was so worried about me.
#822$# Eventually, I came to realize that traveling isn't as scary as my mother told me.
#821$# My mother is always scared that bad things will happen to me... She worries too much.|
51216|#822$# Traveling is great, but my mother is always checking in on me, which can be annoying...
#821$# Ah! Never repeat what I just said! Do you copy?|
51221|What is your favorite food?|
51222|Do you have a preference in food?|
51223|#821$# I've never eaten anything from Terra. My mother always worried about Terran food.|
51224|#821$# Hmm... I don't really have a favorite food. I don't really care what I eat.|
51225|#821$# That thing you're always eating!
#822$# It's just a coincidence; it's not... not because you like it...|
51226|#823$# Everything in Terra seems to be edible. The creatures of Terra are amazing!|
51231|What's your definition of a friend?|
51232|What makes a friend?|
51233|#821$# She taught me what friends are for. But maybe, now, she wishes she'd never known me...|
51234|#821$# Aren't we friends? Or... you don't consider me a friend?
#822$# It's fine if we're not friends. I... I don't care. I don't care at all!|
51235|#821$# Well, I think it should be someone who can share the good times and the bad times with you.
#824$# Why that look? Go an ask another Eidolon, then!|
51236|#821$# Friends... like Endora and Merrilee?
#821$# Or are they not friends, but rivals?
#822$# I see... it's hard to define "friends."|
51241|What sort of person interests you?|
51242|Who do you have feelings for?|
51243|#821$# I don't know if you'd call it love, but there's someone I think about all the time...
#824$# But she... she doesn't want to see me... ever since that day...|
51244|#821$# What? Why bother to ask? Aren't I here, traveling with you?
#822$# I just mean, because I like to travel, not... not because I like you...|
51245|#821$# Hmm... someone you always want to be with, to travel everywhere with... does that count?
#822$# What you laughing at? I'm not talking about you! I'm not!|
51246|#821$ Her... but she doesn't want to see me anymore. Unless he's back...
#824$# But he'll never come back, ever...|
51251|What's so special about the Sky Tower?|
51252|What can you tell me about the Sky Tower?|
51253|#821$# It's said that the holy medicine at the top of the Sky Tower can cure any disease.
#821$# I didn't expect such a thing in Terra. I wonder what it looks like...|
51254|#821$# The Sky Tower? It sounds interesting...
#822$# No? Well, I don't really want to go either. But if you insist, I... I can do that too.|
51255|#821$# The Sky Tower? I've heard it's full of magical weapons.
#821$# But the weapons of Terra... don't they all break after a while? Or do I have it wrong?|
51256|#821$# It's said that a lot of memories are stored in the Sky Tower. I wonder how that happened...
#822$# I wonder if... if it knows the story of me and her...|
51261|Do you know Pandemonium?|
51262|What is Pandemonium like?|
51263|#824$# It's full of revolting demons. There's nothing to talk about!|
51264|#821$# It's said that Pandemonium is a very dangerous place.
#821$# Anything that could survive there must be pretty tough...|
51265|#821$# Pandemonium is different from Terra: it's unconstrained by the shackles of time. 
#821$# The demons there never die naturally - they just get older and more powerful.|
51266|#822$# It's a desolate place, where only cursed wretches live.|
51271|What do you think of Terra?|
51272|What can you tell me about Terra?|
51273|#821$# The creatures of Terra are fascinating! It doesn't matter whether they're Humans, Makar, or Dwarves.
#821$# How can they do so many things with such short lives?|
51274|#822$# Terra? Well... not so bad! I like traveling it with you.|
51275|#821$# Terra is constrained by the shackles of time. Every living thing will eventually die...
#822$# So, if... if you eventually go too, I won't be sad.
#824$# Maybe just... a bit lonely...|
51276|#821$# You must know Terra better than I do.
#822$# You just wanted to hear me talk? Oh, wow... okay...
#824$# What are you laughing at? That didn't make me happy! Not at all!|
51281|What's "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
51282|Have you heard of "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
51283|#821$# It's an epic battle between two groups of mice.
#824$# What are you laughing at? Did I say something funny?|
51284|#821$# Humans are so strange. A battle between mice has nothing to do with you.
#821$# Who cares which side wins, right?
#824$# How could it possibly matter? Humans are so weird...|
51285|#821$# I believe it's... a war between mice trying to get food for the winter?
#821$# I just don't get it. Why even bother getting involved in a mouse battle?|
51286|#822$# A mouse battle? Sounds interesting...
#824$# What? No, I'm not interested. Well, maybe a little... just a little...|
51291|What's the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
51292|What can you tell me about the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
51293|#822$# How did you ever get by without me?
#821$# The Aura Kingdom Quiz is an event in Navea, that's all.
#824$# Hey! Why are you looking at me like that? If you don't believe me, go ask the other Eidolons!|
51294|#821$# It's a competition held in the Garden of Revelations by Major Gerald.
#821$# I've heard some special guests might participate... But I have no idea who they are.|
51295|#821$# It seems to be a competition made up of various kinds of questions.
#821$# Sounds fun - why don't you participate?
#824$# Me? No, I don't want to go! I do not want to go at all!|
51296|#821$# It sounds like... a competition! Why don't you go and participate, and find out for yourself!|
51301|Do you know Hel?|
51302|Do you know the Netherworld Queen?|
51303|#823$# Ah, yes... the infamous Netherworld Queen. Is there anybody who hasn't heard of her?|
51304|#821$# Hel... I wonder if she still remembers me...
#824$# Well, I think it's pretty hard for her to forget about you, since you took away the most important person in her life...|
51305|#821$# She may be beautiful, but her mind is broken. Try as she might, she can't remember the way back to Hellheim.
#821$# Every time Hel gets lost, Gram finds her.
#824$# Gram... If not for me, Gram wouldn't be...|
51306|#821$# Hel... I haven't seen her in ages. I wonder how she's doing...|
51311|Your hair is shimmering. You look gorgeous!|
51312|I love your hair!|
51313|#822$# I'm not happy just because you praised me. Not at all!|
51314|#821$# Hel said something similar once...|
51315|#821$# Thanks! Yours isn't bad either...
#824$# I did not get shy because you praised me! I didn't!|
51316|#823$# Tell me about it! Come on, I'm the God of Light!|
51321|What is your mother like?|
51322|I've heard your mother is very beautiful.|
51323|#821$# My mother is the ruler of sky and land. Of all the goddesses, she is the greatest!|
51324|#821$# My mother loves me very much. She takes care of everything for me.
#821$# If I have nightmares, she always makes me feel better...|
51325|#824$# My mother always treats me like a little kid. It can get pretty annoying...
#821$# Wait! Don't... don't tell anyone what I just said!|
51326|#822$# What? You don't know? Your lack of knowledge is surprising...|
51331|What are the duties of the God of Light?|
51332|What does the God of Light do?|
51333|#821$# To bring light to the world, so that all creatures can bask in its splendor.|
51334|#821$# To illuminate the paths of all creatures, so that they can travel in the light.|
51335|#822$# It's very simple. You don't know? Oh my...
#821$# Why are you looking at me? I'm not gonna tell you!
#821$# Even if you keep asking I'll never tell you! No!|
51336|#824$# You really don't know? Why am I traveling with you?|
51341|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
51342|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
51343|#821$# Everytime Alucard sees me, he laughs strangely... Do I look funny?|
51344|#821$# Hel... I've done something unforgivable to her.
#824$# If I could choose again, maybe... perhaps it would have been better if we'd never met.|
51345|#821$# Supposedly, Aelius wronged Serena in some way, and is always asking her for forgiveness.
#821$# I think I understand how Aelius feels.|
51346|#821$# Every time I talk to Eligos, he's so arrogant.
#824$# He's just Eligos. Why is he so arrogant? Such overconfidence!|
51351|I heard that all living things have made a vow to not harm you.|
51352|I've heard that nothing on can hurt you.|
51353|#822$# I once dreamt about the death, and my mother became very worried.
#821$# After that, my mother made every living thing vow not to hurt me - well, every living thing except mistletoe.|
51354|#821$# Even though I can't be hurt physically, I can still be hurt mentally...|
51355|#823$# Even without the vow, I'm not sure what could hurt me!|
51356|#823$# Oh, I didn't expect you to know that. Not bad!|
51361|What do you regret most?|
51362|What's the worst thing you've ever done?|
51363|#821$# My ignorance caused me to lose my friend... Hel...|
51364|#821$# Because of my ignorance, I... I took a life.
#824$# It was someone very important to her...|
51365|#822$# Why would you ask that? It's none of your business!
#821$# Uhh... Are you angry?
#824$# I... I'll tell you next time. But not because you got angry...|
51366|#822$# Traveling with you!
#821$# Hey, don't... don't cry! I was joking! Joking!
#824$# You aren't crying? I thought you were! I... I wasn't worried! No!|
51371|Your scarf looks pretty good!|
51372|Your scarf looks very delicate!|
51373|#822$# This was made by my mother. It's the only one in the world!|
51374|#822$# This scarf can not only keep you warm, it can also keep you cool.
#821$# But I'm not afraid of cold or heat. My mother worries too much...|
51375|#821$# This is a gift from my mother. It seems to be windproof, rainproof and... dustproof?
#821$# My mother is always worried about me. She tends to overthink about what might hurt me.
#824$# It can get pretty annoying... Ah! Don't... don't repeat what I just said!|
51376|#821$# Of course! It was a gift from my mother.
#824$# What are you laughing at? I didn't... didn't get happy just because you praised me!|
51381|Tell me about your sword!|
51382|Let's talk about your sword!|
51383|#821$# Don't call him "your sword"! He's my partner, Skee!|
51384|#822$# Skee is no ordinary sword. He's made from the light of the first dawn!|
51385|#821$# This is Skee. He's my best and only friend...
#821$# Skee wil never leave or be harmed because of my ignorance.
#824$# You... what are you looking at? I wasn't crying! This is sweat! It's sweat!|
51386|#821$##821$ This is Skee. He's accompanied me every since I was born, and always will.|
51391|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
51392|What would you do if we separated?|
51393|#821$# Even if we part, the light will still shine on you.
#824$# Don't... don't get me wrong. I'd just be doing my duty, I wouldn't be worried about you...|
51394|#821$# I... I would like to go back to Hellheim again. Maybe, just maybe, Hel will want to see me again...
#824$# If she still doesn't want to see me... At least I tried!
#821$# At least, then, I might not feel so sad.|
51395|#821$# Say goodbye? You... you're leaving me?
#824$# If you want to go, just go! I... I won't be sad!
#822$# I won't be sad... maybe just... a bit lonely...|
51396|#821$# I'd return to the skies, to perform the duties of God of Light.|
51501|Do you have a preference in food?|
51502|What do you like to eat?|
51503|#821$# Don't worry about it - human food doesn't really work for me.|
51504|#821$# I don't like the creatures with scales - it reminds me of my dragon form.|
51505|#822$# Whatever you offer me, I will gladly accept.|
51506|#822$# You don't like fish? Good, I don't like fish either.|
51511|What's your strongest memory?|
51512|What's your most unforgettable experience?|
51513|#821$# Meeting you!|
51514|#821$# I once met someone who made me understand the meaning of life.
#822$# He promised me we'd will go on an adventure together when he grew up.
#821$# But human beings are just too weak - he got sick and died, and we never got to travel together.|
51515|#821$# Compared to you and other humans, I've lived such a long time.
#821$# Time takes away a lot of things: youth, vigor, life... and memory.
#822$# A lot of things that you thnk you'll remember forever are eventually forgotten.|
51516|#821$# I can clearly remember your face when you first saw me as a dragon!|
51521|What do I do when I run into a strong enemy?|
51522|Tell me the best strategy for facing a powerful enemy.|
51523|#821$# Ha! Not many people dare fight me. I wouldn't worry about it!|
51524|#821$# Whatever kind of enemy, I will fight by your side.|
51525|#824$# With me here, why worry?|
51526|#822$# This reminds me of the first time we fought together...
#821$# I was surprised, because your skills are the best I've ever seen in a human.|
51531|Do you have a favorite animal?|
51532|What do you think of animals?|
51533|#821$# All creatures are the same to me.|
51534|#821$# Humans are complicated creatures.
#821$# They have the potential to do  such good or evil.
#822$# Humans... they're never boring.|
51535|#821$# Animals just do their thing - they don't care what I think.|
51536|#822$# I've seen humans feed and care for animals sometimes.
#821$# These creatures lose their wild nature, and become tame.
#821$# Is that what humans like? I just don't get it.|
51541|What do you think it means to be powerful?|
51542|What is strength to you?|
51543|#824$# Power? My whole existence is power!|
51544|#821$# Ever since I was born, I've been the most powerful of creatures.
#824$# Power is me. I am power.|
51545|#821$# The law of the jungle: kill or be killed.|
51546|#822$# Humans believe that power is not only in the body, but also in the heart and soul.
#821$# A human told me this once. Do you agree?|
51551|What are your thoughts on the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium?|
51552|What do you think of the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium?|
51553|#821$# Terra is a blessed place.
#823$# The way Terra changes over time makes it very beautiful.|
51554|#822$# Pandemonium... is similar to a place I once lived.|
51555|#821$# I heard that there are angels and creatures with white wings in the Aura Kingdom.
#822$# White wings... something I hate also has white wings...
#824$# ...something covering up a massacre, all in the name of justice...|
51556|#821$# Compared to those in the Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium, the creatures of Terra are tiny.
#822$# But the creatures in Terra give off the most dazzling light.|
51561|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
51562|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
51563|#822$# ... You don't know what Cube of Gaia is? That's surprising...
#821$# Your knowledge of things seems a bit shaky!|
51564|#821$# I heard that this dimension was created by the Cube of Gaia.
#822$# This makes me very curious. If the Cube doesn't have consciousness, how does it make life?
#821$# Or maybe someone used the Cube of Gaia to create the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium...|
51565|#821$# It's made of powerful energy. It takes a strong being to bear this energy.|
51566|#822$# This mysterious Cube of Gaia... its energy feels familiar.
#821$# Perhaps the Cube of Gaia is from my dimension.|
51571|What's it like in Navea?|
51572|What do you think about Navea?|
51573|#822$# It's a place where many different races live together. It's easily the biggest city in Terra.|
51574|#821$# The city isn't that big, but it's filled with creatures from all the races of Terra.
#823$# I admire the tolerance that the inhabitants of Terra show to each other.|
51575|#821$# Whatever I say would just be an outsider's perspective. Why not go and see for yourself?|
51576|#822$# It's a lively place filled with fascinating creatures. 
#821$# I can't remember ever seeing a more vital city.|
51581|What can you tell me about PvP?|
51582|Tell me about the Arena.|
51583|#821$# It's a place where humans fight each other and rank themselves.|
51584|#822$# The Arena made me see that humans are a contradictory race.
#821$# They all say they want peace, but they enjoy fighting as well.|
51585|#821$# It's a place where humans test their battle skills and fight each other.
#821$# You should go have a look. Hone your skills and practice with others - you might learn something!|
51586|#821$# Even with all the enemies around, humans are still fond of fighting each other.
#821$# For as long as I've been watching humans, I still don't understand them.|
51591|What's the point of joining a guild?|
51592|What are your thoughts on guilds?|
51593|#821$# Guilds are human organizational groups. They're a good way to meet people.
#821$# If you feel like being more social, you should join a guild.|
51594|#822$# Weak creatures always form groups to help each other get through life.|
51595|#821$# Human organizations... I barely pay attention to them.
#821$# I heard that Eidolons appear in Guild Manor, but only at certain times.
#822$# I'm very curious to learn more about this.|
51596|#821$# Instead of listening to me, why not join a guild and see for yourself?|
51601|Where are you from?|
51602|Tell me a bit about where you're from.|
51603|#821$# You've asked me this question before. Perhaps you've forgotten?
#822$# It was in a different dimension, where I had a different appearance.|
51604|#821$# If you're talking about the place I was born, it's a hard place for the weak to survive.
#821$# Only the powerful can survive in such a hostile environment, where you're always under attack.
#822$# My hometown seems a lot like Pandemonium in this dimension.|
51605|#821$# You might still not know that I am not from this dimension.
#824$# I traveled through many dimensions searching for you.|
51606|#821$# The most significant difference of my dimension is that it has five realms.
#821$# Heaven, Earth, Humans, Demons and Monsters... The creatures in different realms have agreed on mutual nonaggression.|
51611|Your weapon is awesome!|
51612|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
51613|#821$# This is my other half. It's called "Domesday".|
51614|#821$# The blade in my right hand can cut through space. I came to this dimension with its help.|
51615|#821$#The blade in my left hand can cut through time, and lets me travel to different eras.|
51616|#822$# Ha! You seem to like my other half.
#821$# But your human body can't handle the power, so you'd better not touch me!|
51621|Do you prefer human or dragon form?|
51622|What's your favorite form to take?|
51623|#821$# Dragons are too big to move around freely. If I need to move quickly, it's better to be in human form.|
51624|#822$# The dragon incarnation you've seen is not my true form.
#821$# My real dragon incarnation is immense - as big as Navea!|
51625|#822$# Dragon form is best when the situation calls for power.
#821$# This is the form I was in when I was born.|
51626|#821$# Whatever form I take, it's all me - like it or not!|
51631|What's the reason you came to Terra?|
51632|Why did you come to Terra?|
51633|#821$# I'm here to find someone. To fulfill a promise I made.|
51634|#821$# The person I'm seeking says, "immortality is pain."
#822$# Time exists only in Terra. That's why I'm here.|
51635|#822$# I once promised a child that we would go on adventures together.
#821$# We never went on our adventure - the child died while still young.
#821$# I need to find the child's reincarnation and fulfill my promise.|
51636|#822$# Dragons take promises very seriously, which is why it's rare for them to make promises.
#821$# I have made a promise to someone, and I'm here to fulfill it.|
51641|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
51642|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
51643|#821$# The first time I saw Kaiser Zeta, I thought he was just like the robots made by the Dwarves.
#821$# I was surprised to find that he thought and acted just like a human.
#822$# I wonder how Daedalus was able to make such a human-like robot.|
51644|#822$# Every time I see Serif, I think about you at that age.
#821$# When I first met you, you were the age Serif is now.|
51645|#821$# Even after all this time, Hel still has the innocence of a child.
#823$# Even I can't stop the erosion of time... It makes me admire her.|
51646|#822$# I feel a great kinship with Bealdor.
#821$# I used to be hot-blooded like him...|
51651|Is it doomsday already?|
51652|I've heard you only appear on doomsday... I hope that's not true!|
51653|#821$# Don't worry about it - it's just a rumor.|
51654|#822$# Ha! When I was younger, many considered me an incarnation of doomsday. But that's all in the past.
#821$# People are dazed and confused when they're young. I was no different.|
51655|#824$# What, you actually believe those rumors?|
51656|#822$# To some of my foes, I'm doomsday indeed.|
51661|I've heard that you're looking for someone.|
51662|Are you looking for someone?|
51663|#821$# Oh? Are you offering to help?
#822$# Thanks for your kindness, but I've already found the person I was looking for.|
51664|#821$# Your appearance may have changed, but the color of your soul hasn't.
#822$# You still look like you did when we first met. I'm very happy.|
51665|#821$# Yes, but I've already found that person. And that person is in front of me right now.|
51666|#821$# I came to Terra to find that person's reincarnation and fulfill my promise.|
51671|When you change form, where do your clothes go?|
51672|What happens to your clothes when you turn into a dragon?|
51673|#822$# Ha... Next time I change form, you must watch carefully.|
51674|#821$# I'm the pride of my clan. My form and appearance change together.
#821$# When I'm incarnated as a human, I wear clothes. When I appear as a dragon, I wear armor.|
51675|#822$# Ha... No matter how old you are, you always ask the same questions.
#821$# The first time I met you, you'd just turned 10, and you asked the same question.|
51676|#821$# Ha... Instead of asking me so many questions, why don't you find out for yourself? It's much more fun.|
51681|How old are you?|
51682|I hear you've been around for a long time...|
51683|#822$# Ha... In terms of human life, yes, I've lived for an extremely long time.|
51684|#821$# By the standards of my clan, I'm still young - barely an adult.
#821$# Our kind don't have many children, and I've never seen another clan like ours.|
51685|#822$# The life expectancy of my clan is very long compared to most creatures.
#821$# We sometimes wake from a dream to find that several hundred years have passed.|
51686|#821$# The life expectancy of my clan is extremely long compared to most creatures.
#822$# As a result, we try not to get involved with others.
#821$# Imagine waking up to find all your friends had died. It's a terrible feeling.|
51691|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
51692|What would you do if we separated?|
51693|#821$# Destiny may tear us apart, but it may also bring us together yet again.|
51694|#821$# Without you, I have no reason to be here.
#822$# I would leave this place and return to my home.|
51695|#821$# Don't worry too much about it - you'll find out soon.|
51696|#821$# Don't worry. I will always be with you, until the day you die.|
51801|Is there anyone that you have a crush on?|
51802|Is there someone that you care for?|
51803|#822$# I'm attracted to strong personalities who can meet me on an equal playing field.
#821$# But you're okay!|
51804|#824$# Hahaha! Is this a topic that interests you?
#824$# It's a shame I'm just a sword spirit. I can't really understand what it means to have a so-called 'crush' on someone...|
51805|#822$ You could say that I care for that fellow Alucard... He's a powerful character, after all...
#823$# What's more, he half-transformed himself into a weapon... almost like meeting me halfway!
#823$# I'd love to have a proper fight with him!|
51806|#821$# What kind of a question is that?
#821$# You, of course! Otherwise why would I have chosen to be with you?|
51811|What do you think of fighting?|
51812|Do you like to fight?|
51813|#824$# I love it, of course! That's not even a real question!|
51814|#823$# Hey! Of course! How about a real question?
#823$# Without regard for life or death, I'll put everything I've learned into defeating the enemy! 
#823$# I love the fact that, in the end, one side must always lose!|
51815|#821$# It seems that you're troubled by the idea of battle.
#821$# Here! Let's spar a little. Then you'll see how exciting battle really is.|
51816|#824$# What a silly question!
#822$# Don't forget: I'm a supernatural weapon - the divine sword Kusanagi!|
51821|I wish I could have a Kusanagi of my own!|
51822|Are you willing to rest at my side?|
51823|#823$# Hahaha! What, you?
#822$# When you grow strong enough, that day might arrive.|
51824|#822$# It's still too early! You're not strong enough yet.
#823$# But I'm happy to train with you for awhile.|
51825|#2$# Why don't we go a few rounds? If you beat me, I might just give it some thought.|
51826|#823$# Hahaha! Are you joking? Pretty funny!|
51831|Are you a good student?|
51832|Recommend a good book to me.|
51833|#824$# Hey! That doesn't interest me much... 
#821$# Reading really isn't my cup of tea, so don't ask me that kind of question.
#823$# After all, you don't look so clever yourself. Hahaha!|
51834|#824$# Books aren't my thing. But what if...
#821$# By way of recompense, I shall accompany you to the Otherworld to practice your skills.|
51835|#824$# What? No way! When Amaterasu teaches, I always want to fall asleep. 
#821$# I'm not the least bit interested in studying or reading.
#821$# But hey! That doesn't mean I'm stupid.|
51836|#824$#  What? Could you just stick to questions about weapons and battles?
#821$# You could, however, ask Amaterasu. She's always reading or studying something...|
51841|What should you do if you're feeling sad?|
51842|How do you improve your mood?|
51843|#822$# Perk up now, will you?|
51844|#821$# Haha. Laugh it off, or find someone to pick a fight with.|
51845|#821$# I find a tough fight and release all my pent-up woes in the heat of battle. 
#821$# That really perks me up! That's what I do anyway, even when I'm in a good mood.|
51846|#2$# Although... Amaterasu always used to comfort me when I was sad. 
#2$# You also have someone who you can really talk to, right?
#821$# You really don't? Then I'll be your first friend!|
51851|What do you know about the Quests?|
51852|Tell me about the Quests.|
51853|#821$# Helping others is what the strong ought to do!
#821$# You must try harder to complete missions and prove yourself!|
51854|#821$# I once heard Amaterasu say that in Terra there is an organisation called the Mirabelle Group.
#821$# They receive requests from people in trouble, from all around. You'll help them, won't you?|
51855|#821$# You've had a long day! Completing all those quests!
#821$# If you keep on like this, you'll be better compensated than you may think!|
51856|#824$# The humans are weak... They're often unable to resolve problems on their own.
#824$# So they've put together an organisation that appoints a capable person to deal with matters.
#824$# Maybe you'll consider helping out?|
51861|What's the Cube of Gaia?|
51862|Do you know what the Cube of Gaia is?|
51863|#823$# You really don't know?|
51864|#821$# It's the immense power that created the heavens and the earth, established the three realms, and nutured all life.
#823$# Hahaha! Probably, anyway! That's what Amaterasu told me.
#821$# But I've been thinking... how does such a huge power not have conciousness?|
51865|#824$# That's to say... such a mighty cube...
#821$# Might one day magically transform into a human!|
51866|#824$# I don't understand it so well myself. But I seem to remember Amaterasu talking about it.|
51871|Can you tell me about Blizzard Berg?|
51872|Have you been to Blizzard Berg?|
51873|#824$# Hasn't that place been ravaged by war?|
51874|#821$# There's not much to tell. Why don't you just go and see for yourself!
#822$# Fires and blood. The name brings up some bad memories...|
51875|#823$# It's a freezing place. Haha!|
51876|#821$# I prefer hot to cold, so maybe you should to go Blizzard Berg on your own!|
51881|Can you fish?|
51882|Dou you know how to fish?|
51883|#823$# Hahaha! You really ask some strange questions!
#821$# Why not go and try instead of asking?|
51884|#822$# Water makes me ill! I hope we don't have to get too close to water... 
#821$# But Amaterasu did say that in Terra there are many experts in this field. Why not go and ask?|
51885|#824$# Hey... Are you just talking to hear your own voice? 
#821$# Isn't fishing just a matter of dangling the rod over the water and waiting? No?|
51886|#821$# I'll put it like this... Amaterasu did say that many precious things have been hidden in the waters of Terra.
#824$# But I'm not interested. Why don't you go and try?|
51891|Can you tell me something interesting?|
51892|Tell me about the Hidden Quests.|
51893|#824$# Hey! Don't wait for me to tell you... Go and explore for yourself!|
51894|#821$# I've heard Amaterasu say that small quests are hidden in every region.
#821$# Let me think... I've heard they are marked by green exclamation marks on the map.|
51895|#821$# Hmm... Amaterasu told me. Let me think...
#824$# Sorry. I completely forgot...|
51896|#823$# Hahaha! Just be aware of your surroundings.|
51901|How is Amaterasu related to you?|
51902|Who is Amaterasu?|
51903|#823$# Haha. Are you curious?
#821$# Amaterasu is the bearer of my original sword, and is also the only one who can defeat me!
#821$# But if I keep on training with you... One day I'll certainly be able to beat her.|
51904|#824$# Although I don't care to admit it, Amaterasu is my master. 
#822$# She's also the only one who can defeat me!|
51905|#824$# What a mood killer... Do we have to talk about her?|
51906|#822$# She's my bearer, and my teacher...
#821$# She taught me everything that I know about Terra, including you and your sacred mission.|
51911|From what were you created?|
51912|How was your body forged?|
51913|#821$# I was created through magic, from the body of a snake. Its blood enabled me to magically transform into a spirit sword. 
#823$# To use a human phrase... My last job was as a Demon Sword. Hahaha!|
51914|#822$# As for where I came from... well, the fires in Terra aren't hot enough to forge a weapon like me!|
51915|#824$# Are all humans so nosy? 
#821$# I might as well tell you... the truth is...
#821$# The bones of a demon formed my body. A demon's blood forged my spirit.|
51916|#824$# It's a long story... Let's not go into it.|
51921|Are you really strong?|
51922|Can anyone defeat you?|
51923|#823$# Hahaha! I'm the divine sword Kusanagi!
#822$# I've never met anyone able to withstand my attacks!
#824$# Apart from Amaterasu... but strictly speaking, she's a god.|
51924|#822$# Are you asking because you want to fight?
#822$# Great! I've been hoping to spar from the first moment I set eyes on you! 
#821$# Eh? Where are you going? Don't run off!|
51925|#822$# Humans are always asking questions!
#824$# How many Eidolons have you asked the same thing?|
51926|#823$# I've never been beaten by anyone but Amaterasu!
#823$# So you should have an idea of how strong I am!
#821$# Warped self-confidence is a fine recipe for defeat - so we must always strive to improve ourselves. Right?|
51931|That armor looks really nice on you.|
51932|Tell me about your equipment!|
51933|#821$# This part was transformed from a scabbard!
#824$# If you took away the scabbard, I would be completely naked...
#823$# Haha, only joking! Wait... Does that excite you?|
51934|#2$# It looks good! Haha. You really know how to give a compliment!|
51935|#821$# While we're on the topic, people have asked about my relationship to Kaiser Zeta. 
#824$# My equipment materialized when I transformed into a spirit sword. 
#821$# The origin of my costume? Honestly, this all stems from Amaterasu's sartorial taste...|
51936|#823$# I'm the divine sword Kusanagi! Of course I need a handsome set of armor!
#822$# What? Kaiser Zeta reminds you of me? He's just a copycat!|
51941|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
51942|Tell me some interesting tidbits about the other Eidolons.|
51943|#822$# Abraxas is always going around boasting that he's an undefeated warrior.
#822$# But he's never willing to accept my challenge to fight, saying he doesn't fight with women...
#2$# I guess he's scared of my laser cannons. Haha!|
51944|#2$# That said, Bealdor has a certain presence. 
#2$# His beaming radiance is similar to that of Amaterasu...
#824$# No,no, what am I saying... Bealdor is nothing but a child in comparison with Amaterasu!|
51945|#824$# That girl Tsubaki isn't the sharpest tool in the box...
#824$# Recently, I saw her practicing a sleazy dance routine with Bel-Chandra. She really seems to worry about how big she is...
#821$# I think that what is natural is beautiful. Don't you think so?|
51946|#821$# Listen up: Kotonoha used to be a fox with nine tails!
#821$# Eh? You didn't know? I see...
#824$# Now you tell me something. Nothing else comes to mind...|
51951|What kind of training exercises do you usually do?|
51952|How do you train yourself?|
51953|#821$# When I practiced with Amaterasu, I learned to meditate...
#2$# You may not believe it, but through meditation I've learned a lot about my own shortcomings. 
#821$# Actually, while you're resting, I meditate and reflect on our experiences together...|
51954|#822$# I fight relentlessly! Fight after fight!
#822$# The principle is simple. If you neglect your practice, you will be easily beaten by your opponents.|
51955|#822$# Perhaps the fact that you're asking means your skills aren't up to scratch...
#821$# Every strong warrior must find his or her own way to train. You, too, must find a path of your own.|
51956|#823$# Hahaha! I once asked Amaterasu the same question. 
#824$# She wanted me to ease off, because I was always rushing off to fight...
#824$# Spend more time admiring the scenery!|
51961|Why did you come to Terra?|
51962|Do you have a specific purpose here?|
51963|#821$# To aid you in fulfilling your destiny!
#2$# As to what that destiny is...
#823$# The plans of the gods cannot be known! Isn't that what you humans say?|
51964|#824$# Haven't you noticed all the strange things happening on Terra?
#821$# That's right. You are human, after all!|
51965|#822$# I'm carrying out the orders of Amaterasu: to find a capable person, worthy of trust. 
#821$# That's right. It's you! I know you won't let me down.|
51966|#823$# Haha. Do you need a reason for everything?|
51971|You're very pretty!|
51972|You've really kept in shape!|
51973|#2$# Huh? Really? I didn't know you had such good taste.
#2$# Usually I ask Amaterasu to help me with the polishing, and then I use a soft cloth to give myself a good shine. From time to time, she'll use oil as well. 
#2$# What? Ridiculous! That can't be what you mean!|
51974|#823$# Hahaha! Flattery will get you nowhere!|
51975|#2$# Huh? To be honest, Amaterasu wanted me this way. 
#2$# Sometimes I wish I could wear feathers like Vermilion - but after all, I am a spirit sword...
#823$# This look suits me the best! Don't you agree?|
51976|#822$# Eh? What's with all the sweet talk?
#823$# Are you up to something...?|
51981|What's with the Great Serpent?|
51982|Tell me about the eight-headed serpent.|
51983|#821$# I was created from the body of the eight-headed serpent, so I suppose you could say the serpent is my mother.|
51984|#821$# The serpent's blood still runs through my veins.
#824$# If it weren't for Amaterasu, I'd still be a Demon Sword, slaughtering innocent people...|
51985|#821$# The eight-headed, eight-tailed demon beast symbolizes destruction. 
#824$# But she's also my mother...
#824$# Maybe, one day, I'll be unable to control the demon blood running through my veins.|
51986|#821$# A general, defeated at the hands of Amaterasu! 
#822$# He's an opponent I've always wanted to challenge.|
51991|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
51992|What's your plan after we part ways?|
51993|#824$# No way! Do you really think you could die so easily?
#821$# I'll protect you! Don't worry, okay?|
51994|#821$# I'd never thought of that, let alone planned for it...
#823$# Hahaha! After all, only the weak make plans for the future!|
51995|#822$# If you keep asking that kind of question, I'm going to thump someone on the head!|
51996|#824$# Perhaps I'll head back to Amaterasu and see what arrangements have been made...|
52101|Do you like to travel?|
52102|Let's go on a journey!|
52103|#821$#Want to go traveling with Gretel?
#51$#No way! Besides, Gretel won't want to.|
52104|#823$#Hansel is my best friend. We live together in the forest.
#822$#If Master wants to travel somewhere, I'd most like to go to Mushroom Forest!|
52105|#825$#If you don't want to take my brother along... then I'm not going anywhere!
#824$#Me either! If Gretel's not going, then neither am I!|
52106|#822$#I've been to more places with Gretel than I have with you.
#825$#But every time we get lost, my brother always says...
#824$#There's... there's no need to mention that!|
52111|What's your most memorable experience?|
52112|An unforgettable memory?|
52113|#822$#It's enough to flush my cheeks and set my heart to racing!
#823$#Hehe. Gretel's talking about the first she met you, Master!|
52114|#826$#That time we fought the witch in the forest... I'll never forget it!
#826$#Ah! The time when Hansel got tossed sky-high?
#824$#Hold up... "sky-high"?! Master, don't listen to her!|
52115|#822$#I'll give it some thought! It's probably the day that we met you, our master.
#821$#I think so too... I'll never forget how surprised and happy you were.
#823$#I'm so happy we can travel with you!
#826$#We're counting on you, Master!|
52116|#824$#Hmm...there was one time when we were lost deep in the woods...
#821$#Gretel had left some stones behind to mark our way.
#826$#Her prudence saved our life.
#827$#Hehe. I'm pretty clever, aren't I!?|
52121|What do you like to eat?|
52122|What kind of food do you like most?|
52123|#822$#My brother says I eat too much candy, but I can't say no to sweets!
#823$#Master, if you want some, I'd be happy to share with you...|
52124|#826$#I like to eat apples - nice and healthy! Huh? Candy?
#824$#Who doesn't love candy...but you have to be careful not to overdo it!|
52125|#822$#I'm not picky. I'll eat anything!
#823$#Apart from vegetables, of course.|
52126|#2$#Speaking of food, I'm hungry. Hansel, have an apple!
#823$#Sorry, Master; we only have two. Maybe next time...|
52131|What's your favorite season?|
52132|Which season do you find most comfortable?|
52133|#821$#I prefer autumn. Weather that's cool, but not too cold suits me the best.
#822$#My favorite season is summer! Spring isn't bad either...autumn...
#823$#well! I'll just say autumn like my brother then...|
52134|#825$#Gretel doesn't like winter...|
52135|#821$#Each day's weather is unique, don't you think?|
52136|#823$#I don't like winter. It's so cold that you can't go out to play.
#821$#She's on pretty good terms with Shirayuki, though. Shirayuki really comes alive during the winter.|
52141|Which animals do you like most?|
52142|Do you have a favorite animal?|
52143|#822$#I like sheep the most. They're so cute and well behaved!
#823$#Wild wolves are pretty cool, too.|
52144|#826$#My favorite animal is the wild wolf! They're awesome!
#821$#Gretel likes sheep, and so do I, of course.|
52145|#822$#I like all kinds of animals...
#823$#Insects, however, are another story entirely.
#825$#Yup...can't stand bugs!|
52146|#823$#Why do you ask? Should I be expecting something?
#822$#I want a little kitten doll! One that looks like Astraea!|
52151|Tell me something about Mushroom Forest.|
52152|What's special about Mushroom Forest?|
52153|#821$#It's a forest of delicious mushrooms. Man, my stomach is growling already...
#2$#Hansel, let's have an apple!|
52154|#822$#A forest of mushrooms is a bit different from other forests!
#821$#But I've heard that there are spores that can make you sick...
#826$#As long as you stick with us, you'll be fine!|
52155|#822$#If you're going, I'd like to come with you to pick some mushrooms!
#824$#No, Gretel; Mushroom Forest has been polluted...
#825$#Then we should go and help the locals! And pick some mushrooms when we're done!|
52156|#821$#I've heard there's a monster there called the Snapping Sandworm that ambushes people from underground...
#826$#You've really got to be careful! I'd be scared of being attacked from behind!|
52161|Have you been to Navea?|
52162|Heard of Navea?|
52163|#822$#Sure! Hansel and I have both been there. That place is crammed with people!
#821$#A lot of adventurers hang out at the market stalls. If you're interested, you can go and take a look.
#826$#If you're going, you should take us with you!|
52164|#821$#I don't know if you've noticed, but the scenery outside Navea is really beautiful!
#823$#Gretel and I often picnic by the waterfall there.
#826$#Will you come with us next time?|
52165|#822$#Of course I've heard of it. The Sky Tower is in Navea!
#823$#But you knew that, didn't you, Master?|
52166|#822$#On top of being bustling and beautiful, the food and drink in Navea is great!
#823$#The frosted macaroons are delicious!
#821$#I always go straight for the food.|
52171|Can you tell me a little about the Underground Eidolon Temple?|
52172|The Temple of the Eidolons?|
52173|#825$#I'm not so clear on that...why don't you tell me when you've found out?|
52174|#821$#I've heard it was built by the organization that conducts research on Eidolons.
#824$#Though I'm a little fuzzy on the details...|
52175|#821$#I think it's some kind of mysterious laboratory. You can summon and face off against part of an Eidolon's will...
#826$#That sounds exciting. I'm up for it! Master, will you lead us to this challenge?|
52176|#821$#I'm not so sure how it works, but I've heard that it can challenge the powerful Eidolons...
#826$#Maybe this would be a good oportunity to win the favor of other Eidolons.|
52181|What's the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
52182|What can you tell me about the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
52183|#822$#I know! That's it! It's...
#825$#now I've lost it. Sorry, Master. I'm going back to study!|
52184||
52185|#822$#That's a good question! Do you know, Hansel?
#826$#Of course I know. I've studied up on all this with Bealdor!
#822$#Master, you're the only one who doesn't know.|
52186|#822$#Quiz? Why don't you give it a practice run with me?
#823$#Bro! Who's the cutest girl alive?
#827$#Gretel is the cutest girl alive, of course.|
52191|Can you tell me a bit about the Auction House?|
52192|What's the Auction House for?|
52193|#822$#A place where you can buy a load of candy? Master, you'll buy me some, won't you?|
52194||
52195|#823$#I want to open a candy shop at the Auction House!
#821$#You'll put up the capital, won't you, Master?|
52196|#826$#Master, you'll be able to find anything at the Auction House !
#821$#That's what's so special about it.|
52201|I've heard you have a way with witches!|
52202|Have you ever defeated a witch?|
52203|#826$#Bring it on, bi- err, witches!|
52204|#825$#They're not your average witches - they're evil! They worship an evil force...
#827$#Gretel, don't be afraid. Master and I will both protect you!|
52205|#821$#It was a really close shave. That witch was planning to scarf us down for din-din...
#822$#Bro's so stacked that the witch didn't know what hit her!
#823$#The witch had no chance against sis's magic!|
52206|#825$#I can't remember; if you really want to know, ask my brother.|
52211|Wow! A Shining Stone!|
52212|I've picked up a Shining Stone!|
52213|#822$#Wow! A Shining Stone. I want it!
#821$#Hel used to have Shining Stones like this.
#823$#I wonder if she picked them up because she was afraid she'd get lost...|
52214|#821$#Wow! These stones are particularly useful as path markers. With their help, you'll be able to find a way out of the forest.
#822$#Is picking up stones...a hobby of yours? Hmm...that's a pretty unique hobby.|
52215|Wow! A Shining Stone!?|
52216|#821$#Hehe. Master, do you like these little things?
#827$#I like bright little stones too!|
52221|Can you tell me something about your weapon?|
52222|What is your weapon?|
52223|#826$#My gloves are called Moonhowl Claws! Pretty cool, huh?
#821$#With a swipe and a slash, I can whip up a tornado and blow the enemy halfway to Oz!
#826$#I can tell you're impressed.|
52224|#822$#I have the windshear horn, Kotonoha and Aelius.
#2$#I also have an all-purpose picnic basket! It's full of apples, lollipops, doughnuts...|
52225|#826$#The wind is our weapon!
#823$#You're such a stallion!|
52226|#822$#Mine isn't just any picnic basket!
#823$#Even if used as a weapon in battle, it won't break! It's a super picnic basket!|
52231|Would you ever consider spending some time apart?|
52232|Have you tried separating?|
52233|#825$#Master, how could you ask that? Now I'm angry!|
52234|#51$#Master, what are you playing at? Gretel, get behind me!|
52235|#822$#I've never even considered it...my brother can't live without me!
#824$#Don't you mean the opposite?|
52236|#822$#We've always been together. We've never thought of separating...
#825$#Master, are you asking because you've been through a painful breakup...?
#821$#Master, don't be sad. Gretel and I will always be there for you!|
52241|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
52242|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolons.|
52243|#822$#I'll let you in on a secret: Grandpa Vayu and Vermilion are a couple!
#824$#Gretel, don't spout rubbish; Master will fall for it...
#823$#Hehe. I was just joking...|
52244|#821$#Huh...Bealdor and Hel weren't getting on...
#823$#Astraea had to intervene.
#824$#Hey! Enough joking around, Master will believe it!!!|
52245|#822$#Shirayuki comes from a very far-off place. I've heard that it's always winter there...
#825$#I hate winter. But I like Shirayuki.
#821$#She's so kind to me, and always gives me candy.
#823$#That's right! Shirayuki is the best!|
52246|#821$#I've heard that Astraea is Aelius and Serena's sister.
#824$#But they don't look that alike...|
52251|Have you heard of Candy Cottage?|
52252|Are you from Candy Cottage?|
52253|#821$#Master, where did you hear about that?|
52254|#822$#Candy is my favorite! So, someone has written about Candy Cottage!
#821$#If you're interested, Master, you can come and take a look!|
52255|#821$#That's what it's called, but not everything there is candy...
#822$#As much as I'd like it to be.|
52256|#822$#A cottage made of candy...sounds tasty!
#821$#But you must be talking about our home.
#822$#Eh? Our home is called Candy Cottage, but it's not made of candy.|
52261|Could you tell me a little about those two puppets?|
52262|What puppet is that?|
52263|#822$#This is Kotonoha and Aelius.
#822$#Master, you may not believe it, but these two puppets were made by my brother!|
52264|#821$#Those are Gretel's, but they're not just simple puppets!
#826$#They can store huge amounts of magic and release a ton of power!|
52265|#823$#I made them for Gretel when she was small and had trouble sleeping.|
52266|#823$#Hehe - they're cute, aren't they? But I can't give them to you; they're Gretel's.|
52271|What do you do to wind down?|
52272|What do you normally get up to?|
52273|#823$#I like to go on picnics with Gretel. Master, maybe next time you'll come along!|
52274|#826$#I usually see Kaiser Zeta about learning new fighting skills! But...
#824$#I still haven't figured out how to shoot out beams of destruction...|
52275|#824$#I usually take Gretel shopping...Girls really know how to spend these days.
#821$#Master, why don't you come with me next time?|
52276|#822$#Hmm, nothing all that special. Why don't you come hang out with us, Master?
#826$#Yeah, come along - it'll be fun!|
52281|Both of you are really cute!|
52282|You're cute.|
52283|#823$#Thank you, Master! You've made Gretel happy, and you're cute too!|
52284|#821$#Hmm! Don't you think I look more impressive while fighting?
#822$#I'm not that keen on being called "cute".
#824$#But if it's you who's saying it, Master, then I don't mind...|
52285|#822$#Master, do you think Gretel's puppets are cute?|
52286|#824$#Thanks...
#825$#Hansel is embarrassed because you said he was cute.
#821$#That's not it! I'd just prefer that you think of me as handsome and cool...|
52291|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
52292|What's your plan after we part ways?|
52293|#825$#I don't want to...Wherever Master goes, I want to go with him.|
52294|#824$#Eh? Master, are you going somewhere where we can't follow?|
52295|#825$#I...I'd never thought that...
#827$#Let's head into the woods and wait for Master to return!|
52296|#825$#I don't want to part with you, Master! I don't want to leave Hansel either...
#827$#I won't leave Gretel! Master, where are you planning to go?|
52401|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
52402|How do you kill time?|
52403|#822$#Sometimes I practice with Sigrun to stay in tip-top fighting shape.
#821$#I gotta stay sharp - protecting you is a full time job.
#822$#Also, you've been getting stronger too - there's no way I'm gonna let you show me up!|
52404|#821$#A good rest helps optimize your training.
#822$#I can teach you how to train, if you're interested!|
52405|#822$#I also knit and cook from time to time, speaking of which...
#823$#How about a scarf! Blizzard Berg is too cold, I'm worried you might catch a nasty bug.|
52406|#821$#You're a hot topic with the other Eidolons during breaks.
#822$#Everyone speaks so highly of you! I am so proud of you!|
52411|What are your weaknesses?|
52412|Are you scared of anything?|
52413|#822$#With you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything.|
52414|#821$#Let me guess why you asked...|
52415|#821$#I'm fearless and rather powerful, in case you hadn't noticed.
#824$#C'mon! Do I really have to point it out?|
52416|#824$#Do you always have to be so blunt? If you were having a pleasant conversation with a powerful enemy, would you ask the same question?
#821$#Since we're on the topic, I'm gonna lay down a couple ground rules:  Don't talk to strangers, and whatever you do DON'T take their candy!|
52421|What to do if you encounter a strong enemy?|
52422|How do you handle a strong enemy?|
52423|#823$#Fear not. We'll charge the enemy head-on!
#821$#Don't worry, I'll have your back!|
52424|#821$#Cute question, don't you have the Goddess of War by your side already?|
52425|#823$#I'll be rooting for you...safe where no one can see me!
#822$#Just kidding, I'll fight right along with you and Duchess Victory.|
52426|#822$#First block their blow with your shield, then swoop in when their guard is down...
#821$#Huh? You don't want me getting physical with the enemy?
#824$#Stop it!... You're making me blush!|
52431|What do you like to eat?|
52432|What do you like to eat?|
52433|#821$#I've always wanted to try a golden apple, and once I was THIS close to tasting one...|
52434|#821$#Nothing in particular...
#822$#Why don't you tell me about your favorite food? I'm a magician in the kitchen!|
52435|#821$#Don't bother, Eidolons like me create our own energy from the sun and the moon.
#822$#Haha, gotcha! Seriously, I'd love to try anything you make!|
52436|#824$#Are you hungry already?! But we aren't even finished training yet!
#821$#Alright, but just this once! Take a break.|
52441|Who do you like?|
52442|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
52443|#822$#Good question! I like a strong personality,
#821$#someone who's powerful, compassionate, and trusted by the Eidolons.
#823$#Ah, have I said too much?|
52444|#821$#Hmm... I'm worried about Alucard's unusually strong power,
#821$#I may need every ounce of strength to fight him...
#822$#Who do you think will win?|
52445|#822$#Don't you have a better question?
#821$#Besides, you already know the answer to this question.|
52446|#821$#I wonder how Abraxas is doing...
#824$#As well as Serena and Aelius...
#822$#But most of all, I wonder why you're asking me this question?|
52451|Have you heard of the Glorious Frost Crown?|
52452|Tell me about the Glorious Frost Crown.|
52453|#822$#Are you interested in the war? Although I'd like to explain everything to you...
#821$#it would be better if you could experience it yourself.|
52454|#821$#The war has been dragging on for centuries now.
#822$#The Azure Frost Tribe fought against the Scarlet Flame Tribe in a quest for glory.
#823$#You've got to give them credit, at least they're fighting for what they believe in. Don't you agree?|
52455|#821$#I think this war would be over a lot sooner if I were the commander.|
52456|#822$#Are you really interested, or do you just want to talk?
#821$#I am happy with either!|
52461|What's Emerald Marsh like?|
52462|Tell me about Emerald Marsh.|
52463|#822$#Emerald Marsh lies in the north of Midgard.
#821$#I heard that it's under lockdown at the moment. So be careful if you're heading there.|
52464|#821$#I hear Waterweed Wetland in Emerald Marsh is quite beautiful.
#823$#Maybe we should see for ourselves if the legends of its splendor are true...|
52465|#821$#There's an evil corrupting Emerald Marsh...
#824$#If it falls into the wrong hands, it could be disastrous.|
52466|#822$#What? You're not dilly-dallying, are you? That's not allowed!
#824$#Emerald Marsh is a dangerous place right now. Just think about all those savage beasts and demons...
#821$#But if you insist on going, at least take me with you - my shield can keep you safe.|
52471|Can you tell me about the Sky Tower?|
52472|What's the Sky Tower like?|
52473|#822$#Rumor has it there's a mystical potion at the very top of the Sky Tower that can cure any illness.
#824$#Though as an Eidolon, I don't understand what it feels like to be sick...|
52474|#822$#Supposedly the Sky Tower was sealed a long time ago.
#821$#It beats me why it's suddenly open again...|
52475|#822$#There seem to be rare treasures sealed in the tower...
#823$#Should we check it out?|
52476|#821$#I wonder if I'll be able to see my hometown from the top of the Sky Tower...|
52481|I'd like to know more about Dragon Points.|
52482|What can you tell me about Dragon Points?|
52483|#822$#You receive Dragon Points for defeating powerful enemies.
#821$#You can exchange them for fantastic prizes.
#823$#Let's go collect some Dragon Points!|
52484|#822$#Dragon Points are blessed by Azuria.
#821$#If you're collecting them, I'll lend you a hand!|
52485|#821$#I'm curious too. I wonder what kind of item it is? It'd have to be pretty special to be exchanged for such rare treasures.|
52486|#823$#Are you going to give me the Accessory you've exchanged?|
52491|Tell me more about Archaeology.|
52492|Let's talk about Archaeology!|
52493|#822$#This isn't too difficult, why don't you try to solve it yourself?!
#821$#You can't be TOO dependent on me.|
52494|#821$#You're as curious as I am! Let's see...
#822$#If I remember right, you can practice Archaeology if you buy the right tools from an Archaeologist Merchant.
#821$#I bet you'll dig up some priceless artifacts!|
52495|#821$#This question is way above my pay grade.
#822$#I suggest you ask the Archaeology Association.
#823$#They'll give you a much better explanation!|
52496|#822$#I hear there are a few treasure maps lying around.
#821$#I'm dying to know what's underground!
#823$#Let's do a bit of digging if we have some spare time! |
52501|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
52502|Let's talk about your weapon.|
52503|#821$#Her name is Duchess Victory - my steadfast companion through countless battles.
#822$#She can deflect any attack with her left hand and defeat any defense with her right.|
52504|#821$#The spear in her right hand can overcome any defense, and the golden shield in her left can block any attack!
#824$#I can tell from the look in your eyes that you want them to fight each other.|
52505|#821$#A worthy companion, just like you.|
52506|#824$#It's embarrassing that you found out about this...
#821$#I wrote my name on the shield in case I lost it... It's not an autograph...
#822$#Huh? You want to know why I would ever lose it in the first place? Don't trouble yourself with such trivial matters!|
52511|Why did you come to Terra?|
52512|What brought you to Terra?|
52513|#821$#You probably know better than I do.|
52514|#822$#I have to serve as his guardian angel and protect him on his quest.
#821$#Care to guess who I'm talking about?|
52515|#822$#I came here to find the person I need to protect.|
52516|#2$#Sightseeing! Terra is completely different from my homeland.
#821$#Okay, I was only joking. I really would like you to show me around if time permits.|
52521|Serena is cute!|
52522|Serena reminds me of a cute little rabbit.|
52523|#821$#Cute? I'm not sure we're talking about the same Serena.|
52524|#821$#I do have a sister named Serena.
#822$#However, I'm not sure she's the one you were referring to.
#824$#The Serena I know is more... more...|
52525|#823$#I guess she is pretty cute. If only she and Aelius could patch things up... |
52526|#51$#Come again? Serena?|
52531|Your outfit is astonishing!|
52532|You look beautiful!|
52533|#821$#Such flattery! What's your angle?
#823$#Well, you look pretty sharp, too!|
52534|#821$#I crafted this armor myself. It looks like we both have the same sense of style!|
52535|#822$#Armor should to be ornate and lightweight, as well as defensive.
#823$#The armor I'm currently wearing is my magnum opus!|
52536|#823$#You do like it, don't you?
#824$#I don't know what I'd do if you didn't.|
52541|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
52542|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolons.|
52543|#822$#Don't you think Kusanagi and Kaiser Zeta are alike?
#821$#Kaiser Zeta always tries change the subject when asked about Kusanagi, though...|
52544|#822$#Merrilee seems to like apples, too. To her, apples symbolize wisdom.
#821$#I wonder if she knows about the golden apple...|
52545|#822$#Vayu and Vermilion come from a place which is completely different from my hometown.
#821$#This means that the world created by the Cube of Gaia is much larger than I had imagined.
#824$#It seems that I still have much to learn.|
52546|#822$#Aelius hides a handsome face behind that cape.
#821$#Personally, I think he's as handsome as Bealdor!|
52551|Do you have many siblings?|
52552|Can you tell me about your siblings?|
52553|#822$#You know Aelius and Serena, don't you?
#821$#They're my beloved brother and sister; they symbolize the sun and the moon, respectively.|
52554|#824$#Thanks to my father... I do have quite a few siblings.|
52555|#824$#Aelius and Serena haven't seen each other since that incident.
#822$#I wish they would just make up with one another. What do you think?
#821$#Please talk to them about it if you have the time.|
52556|#822$#Why bring this up all of a sudden? Do you have problems with your siblings?
#821$#So do I...|
52561|I hear you're very good at crafty things.|
52562|Are you any good at knitting?|
52563|#822$#Have you been asking about me? I am, indeed! I can knit just about anything.
#821$#Next time you want to know something about me, just ask me directly.|
52564|#823$#I'm not only good at knitting; I can also cook!
#822$#You should try sometime! My specialty is Stardust Flower sauteed in dirt.|
52565|#822$#Tanith often praises me like that, too.
#824$#It's usually because she wants my help, though.
#823$#Just let me know if there's anything I can do to help!|
52566|#823$#Next time, you can see for yourself just how good I am.|
52571|Is there anything that makes you angry?|
52572|What is something that would make you angry?|
52573|#824$#It's dangerous to be a slave to your emotions.
#821$#What? Suppose someone lifts up my skirt?
#823$#Of course I'd be angry! Very!|
52574|#822$#I don't think I'd be able to keep my cool 
#821$#if someone tried to hurt you in front of me.|
52575|#821$#Sometimes I just get up on the wrong side of the bed...
#824$#Hush! Don't tell anyone! I'm embarrassed about it.|
52576|#821$#Take a deep breath and calm down so you can think.|
52581|Let's talk about the time of your birth.|
52582|Do you remember your birth?|
52583|#821$#Mother said I was born wearing armor, weapon in hand.
#822$#Do you think I was supposed to be a boy?  |
52584|#821$#That was such a long time ago...
#824$#Are you trying to get me to reveal my age? Shoot!|
52585|#824$#I've heard that Father was scared of my birth.
#821$#He tried to stop me from being born.|
52586|#821$#My first words were, "I am the Almighty."
#823$#Haha - I'm just pulling your leg.|
52591|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
52592|What's your plan after we part ways?|
52593|#824$#When that day comes, you must be strong enough to go on without my protection.|
52594|#822$#Why are you bringing this up now?
#823$#Don't worry about it. I've never even thought about leaving your side!  |
52595|#821$#Even if we take divergent paths, we will meet again - it is our destiny.|
52596|#821$#I will return whence I came and watch over you from afar.|
52701|Feel like singing?|
52702|Sing a song for me!|
52703|#822$#Nah, I'll pass.|
52704|#823$#I don't really feel like singing, why don't you go first?|
52705|#821$#Right here right now? No way Jose!
#824$#No stage, no band... No way I'm singing under these circumstances!|
52706|#823$#What? You're a fan of my band too?!|
52711|What do you do in your free time?|
52712|How do you like to kick back and relax?|
52713|#822$#I'm so not telling you! A girl's gotta have some secrets!|
52714|#822$#Read a book or draw a picture, why are you asking?
#821$You wanna ask me out?|
52715|#822$#Work on my plans to steal your heart! You'll be mine one day, you can count on that!|
52716|#823$#You go first! If I like what I hear, maybe I'll share too!|
52721|What's your most memorable experience?|
52722|Anything ever happen that was simply unforgettable?|
52723|#821$#The first time I met Serena... I was so startled, I couldn't believe my eyes...|
52724|#823$#The day I met you! I don't think I'll ever forget that look on your face!
#821$#Just admit it, you got the hots for me, dontcha?!|
52725|#821$#A few years back, I had this delicious chocolate mousse that was simply divine... I'd die to taste it again!|
52726|#823$#Now you mention it... I had a dream about you last night...|
52731|Do you like to fight?|
52732|What do you think of fighting?|
52733|#821$#Fighting makes my clothes dirty so I like to avoid it...
#824$#Gotta keep up appearances!|
52734|#822$#If someone picked a fight with you, they'd live to regret it!|
52735|#823$#What about you? You like to fight, right? I'll let you do all the hard work then!|
52736|#821$#I don't really like to, but if you asked me nicely, I suppose I could do you a favor...|
52741|Do you prefer day or night?|
52742|Which do you prefer, day or night?|
52743|#821$#It's a no-brainer... Night of course! I didn't get my nickname "Mistress of Moonshadow" for nothing!|
52744|#824$#Are you... seriously asking me this question?|
52745|#822$#That being said, I don't mind daytime. After all, the sunlight lets you enjoy my pretty face even more!|
52746|#821$#Which do you prefer? I happen to like both!|
52751|What's special about Port Skandia?|
52752|Can you give me an introduction to Port Skandia?|
52753|#822$Isn't that your hometown? You ought to know that place better than I do!|
52754|#821$It has...a lot of fish? Maybe some boats?|
52755|#824$Just your average seaside town I suppose...|
52756|#821$I don't have the slightest clue... Why don't you could give an introduction instead?|
52761|Could you tell me something about Starstruck Plateau?|
52762|Have you been to Starstruck Plateau?|
52763|#821$#You can see my home from there!|
52764|#821$#The place with fallen stars?... That place always gives me the creeps. Be careful if you have to go there.
#824$#I'd be heartbroken if anything happened to you!|
52765|#821$#You planning to go there? I'm coming along! You better not forget me!
#822$#Taking a long, moonlit walk with you under an ocean of stars... I can't think of anything more romantic!|
52766|#824$#That place... it's contaminated by a dark force.
#821$#Not that I hate the darkness, but I'd be extra careful there if I were you.|
52771|Could you tell me your opinion on Terra?|
52772|What do you think of Terra?|
52773|#821$Terra is where you live.|
52774|#822$Terra is a bustling place, nothing like where I come from.|
52775|#821$What is your opinion on the Eidolon Menu then?|
52776|#823$I like Terra just as much as I like you!|
52781|Can you tell me about Refining Levels?|
52782|What do you know about Refining?|
52783|#821$#I'm allergic to manual labor. I'll just leave it up to you!|
52784|#821$#Refining Levels... you do the same thing over and over again, getting a little better each time.|
52785|#821$#If you're planning to go digging in the dirt sometime soon... I think I'll just leave alone for a while.|
52786|#821$#I have no idea! Why don't you ask someone else?|
52791|Could you tell me about the Glorious Frost Crown?|
52792|Have you heard of the Glorious Frost Crown?|
52793|#821$#It's all about fighting and killing each other. That's just so barbaric!|
52794|#821$#The view there is quite nice though... if only we could get rid of all the fighting.|
52795|#821$#Two words¡Vsky high! You feel like you can reach out and touch the stars!|
52796|#821$#If you plan on going there... be careful...|
52801|What's the relationship between you and Serena?|
52802|What's the relationship between you and the Moonlight Maiden?|
52803|#821$#You tell me!|
52804|#821$#Serena? Doesn't ring a bell.
#824$#Hey! Don't you peek at my Picture Book!|
52805|#821$#We're sort of... twins? I don't really know though. But we are definitely NOT the same! That much I can tell you.
#822$#And for the record, I don't like Serena, not at all!|
52806|#824$#Ever seen an eclipse? I come from the dark side of the moon...|
52811|Are you a Moonlight Maiden, too?|
52812|Were you born on the moon?|
52813|#821$#Wait! You're not comparing me to that catty sister of mine, are you?
#824$#That's it! You're getting the silent treatment for the next... two hours!|
52814|#821$#They say Serena was born in the moonlight while I was born in the moon's shadow...
#822$#I suppose that makes us two sides of the same coin in a way. Alike in some ways but completely opposite in others.|
52815|#824$#How dare you ask me something like that!|
52816|#824$#You're just trying to piss me off, aren't you?|
52821|Could I take a look at your Picture Book?|
52822|How about showing me your Picture Book?|
52823|#824$#How rude! Unless you plan on telling me YOUR deepest, dark secrets, I think not!|
52824|#824$#Hmph! Talk about an invasion of privacy! I'm a respectable lady, you know!|
52825|#821$#You'd probably be bored by it anyway. It's just a bunch of doodles.|
52826|#822$#As if!|
52831|Your dress is so cute!|
52832|You look absolutely adorable in that.|
52833|#821$#Of course, it is! It's my motto, you know. Look sharp, BE sharp!|
52834|#822$#Oh? I'm glad you like it. I put a lot of thought in my style...|
52835|#821$#Ohoho! That is because I actually take things like fashion seriously! Not like that catty sister of mine.
#824$#What? Serena has a nice figure?! And what about ME?! I'm the one standing right in front of you!|
52836|#821$#I can make any outfit look divine!|
52841|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
52842|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
52843|#821$#You know that Serena HATES Aelius, right? Crazy! But I think he's sweet.
#823$#That and he plays the meanest harp this side of the continent!|
52844|#821$#You know Gigas, right? He has an amazing voice! Almost as good as mine.
#824$#It almost shames me to admit how good he is... ahh, what an angel...|
52845|#821$#One flap of Alucard's wings makes the very earth shake!
#824$#Can you imagine what it must be like for him just stretching his wings in the morning?|
52846|#822$#I swear that Hel must work out every day. I did ask her once...
#821$#Apparently she's just a natural, though. It's like she can move without thinking!|
52851|Do you know Aelius?|
52852|What do you think of Aelius?|
52853|#823$#Have you heard Aelius play his harp? The way he moves his fingers is to DIE for!
#821$#I've been trying to recruit him for my band,
#824$#but he seems more interested in patching things up with Serena.|
52854|#821$#Aelius? He's a great guy!
#823$#Could use a pair of rabbit ears though. I think Serena would forgive him in a heartbeat then!|
52855|#823$#Ohoho! I see what you're asking here...
#821$#But Aelius and I are just friends, truly. Did I disappoint you?|
52856|#822$#Not only is Aelius a fine piece of man, he can even play the harp! Talk about heartthrob!
#821$#Don't get snippy though. I promise you're still my favorite!|
52861|Who else is in your band?|
52862|You have a band?|
52863|#822$#H-hey! Not so loud!! How did you even hear about my band?!|
52864|#821$#My band is nothing if not awesome! Gretel rocks out on the horn and Hansel sets the tambourine on fire!
#824$#Though Hansel's asked if he could change instruments... as if! We need that tinsel beat!|
52865|#823$#So you know about my band, hm? I'm surprised!
#821$#That being said, could you please keep it to yourself? We're not quite... ready to perform just yet...|
52866|#824$#I actually just kicked Uriel out of the band...
#821$#I simply can't have things being set on fire at the drop of a hat! It's a safety hazard!|
52871|Tell me about your moon!|
52872|That's one special moon you've got there!|
52873|#821$#I think of it as the dark side of the moon. The shadow behind the eclipse. Gives it more of an "edge."
#823$#I put in a lot of thought into the decoration, too. Pretty cool, don't you think?|
52874|#823$#It's positively stunning, wouldn't you agree? Serena's moon can't even compare!|
52875|#823$#The only one worthy of this moon is me, me, me!|
52876|#824$#Ohoho, you? Sit on my moon? Why, it would sink straight to the ground!|
52881|Do you have any regrets?|
52882|Any unhappy memories you'd like to forget?|
52883|#823$#Oh? Hmm... nothing worth mentioning. I'm as happy as they come!|
52884|#822$#I sometimes worry that God will turn his back on me. Children born of the darkness, you know...
#821$#Fortunately, I don't have to worry about that with you! You truly are my everything.|
52885|#824$#Nostalgia's for babies. I prefer to live in the moment!
#821$#Besides, no matter how dark it may get, dawn is never far off.
#822$#A new morning brings with it a new light.|
52886|#822$#Unhappy memories? Hmm...
#824$#I suppose if you abandoned me that would be a pretty unhappy memory.|
52891|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
52892|What's your plan after we part ways?|
52894|#824$#What?! I refuse to even think about that!|
52895|#821$#I suppose if that really did happen, I'd simply spend more time with my band.
#823$#In fact, we might even go on a world tour! I'll be so popular, you'll constantly be reminded of how good you had it!|
52896|#822$#W-wait! Why are you asking me this?
#824$#You're not... really abandoning me, are you?|
59001|A little exercise never hurt anyone... Right?|
59002|I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys!|

#823$#You just keep getting better and better!|

#822$#Fighting alongside you is a breeze!|
60003|#822$#I'd say you've found the secret to facing %s2.
#821$#They are no match for you at all.|
60004|#821$#%s2 could never hurt you... Not even twenty of them!
#823$#It's obvious you've got some serious talent.|
60005|#822$#Ha ha, what fun!
#821$#A mere %s2 was no match for our combo attack!|
60006|#821#Don't take this the wrong way... but you look really awesome when you fight!
#823$#Like an eagle ready to strike! Whooosh!|
60007|#821$#It's fun taking on our foes side by side!|
60008|#821$#Your moves are incredible!
#822$#Give me some pointers next time we have a break.|
60009|#821$#Ha ha, nicely done! Now it's my turn to show some moves.|
60010|#823$#Your battle skills are simply superb!|
60011|#822$#Did you see how silly all those %s2 looked when you beat them up?
#821$#They had nothing on your elegant moves!|
60012|#821$#Yes! Every one of our attacks is full of resolve.
#822$#Anyone who underestimates us will pay dearly.|
60013|#823$#It's an honor to fight by your side.|
60014|#823$#Nice! That attack was super fancy!|
60015|#821$#Your fighting is a thing of beauty.|
60016|#824$#Don't you think this battle is starting to get boring?|
60017|#822$#Why so serious? You should take it easy once in a while.|
60018|#821$#No one can escape our combo attack!|
60019|#821$#Show some mercy once in a while.|
60020|#822$#How rude! You didn't leave any enemies for me!|
60021|#821$#Isn't it a bit boring to keep fighting %s2 over and over again?|
60022|#822$#You've taken out so many %s2 in such a short time. Nice skills!|
60023|#823$#Incredible! %s2 is definitely no match for you!|
60024|#821$#How can you attack so quickly? I can barely keep up!|
60025|#823$#It seems like %s2 is really weak. Or maybe you are too strong? Hee hee.|
60026|#823$#Not bad! I wasn't expecting you to be so strong.|
60027|#823$#No one can withstand our joint attack!|
60028|#824$#Don't you think that these opponents are too weak?|
60029|#823$#Take that, %s2! Now you know how tough we are!|
60030|#821$#We should find some tougher opponents. I've barely broken a sweat!|
60031|#824$#Wow, I've never seen that look on your face before... You must really despise %s2!|
60032|#823$#You never get tired of this, do you? Ah, the vitality of youth!|
60033|#823$#Awesome! You knocked out a whole bunch of %s2 with one shot!|
60034|#821$#Ha! We are not to be trifled with!|
60035|#823$#I could fight by your side forever. Let's go!|
60036|#822$#Don't let it go to your head just because you beat up a %s2!|
60037|#821$#I think you should leave these weaklings alone and seek out some tougher baddies.|
60038|#823$#Wow, you are ugly when you're angry! Ha ha, just kidding!|
60039|#823$#Heh heh... It's fun toying with %s2.|
60040|#823$#Taking down that %s2 really got my blood pumping!|
60041|#822$#When I saw you calmly take down %s2,
#821$#I knew right away that you had amazing potential.|
60042|#824$#Phew... Have we won?
#822$#%s2 was surprisingly strong.|
60043|#823$#Well aren't you something! I wouldn't have expected that you could beat an enemy like %s2.|
60044|#822$#That battle between you and %s2 was thrilling!
#821$#I almost had a heart attack watching it.|
60045|#821$#Whoa! %s2's attack was really intense. I would have been in big trouble if you hadn't bailed me out.|
60046|#821$#Thanks to you, we were able to win this tough battle.|
60047|#821$#%s2 definitely deserved their reputation. Tough as nails!
#823$#Too bad they had to run into you and I!|
60048|#823$#Accept your defeat, %s2! Ha ha!|
60049|#822$#%s2? They're so weak, they're hardly worth mentioning.|
60050|#821$#Now you see just how powerful we are, don't you, %s2?
#822$#You'll never be able to oppose us!|
60051|#823$#Yeah! I've gained a ton of valuable battle experience.|
60052|#823$#Don't complain, %s2... Accept your fate gracefully.|
60053|#823$#Victory is ours!|
60054|#823$#We make one heck of a team!|
60055|#823$#Whew, that was fun! Let's do that again sometime.|
60056|#824$#Thanks! Without you watching my back, I'd be dead for sure!|
60057|#821$#I almost can't believe you took %s2 down. Have you been secretly training without me?|
60058|#821$#These may be new enemies, but we keep giving them the same old beatdown!|
60059|#821$#You handled that %s2 with ease!|
60060|#823$#%s2 had some powerful attacks, didn't they? Not as powerful as us, though!|
60061|#821$#That last battle was all you! I barely made a dent in %s2.|
60062|#821$#I gotta keep getting stronger. Next time I'll win for sure!|
60063|#822$#Did %s2 leave you with scars? Don't worry, there is no shame in being marked by a tough battle.|
60064|#823$#Not even %s2 a threat, you're that amazing!|
60065|#821$#What a hair-raising scuffle. Let's take a break to catch our breaths.|
60066|#821$#It's so much fun fighting alongside you!|
60067|#823$#You're naive if you think you can beat us, %s2!|
60068|#823$#That was a really amazing strike!|
60069|#821$#Your abilities are out of this world! %s2 couldn't even scratch you!|
60070|#823$#Suck it up, %s2!|
60071|#821$#Looks like you've been hitting the gym pretty hard lately.|
60072|#822$#While we're being honest, I was never a big fan of all this fighting and death and junk...|
60073|#821$#Wow, you even beat %s2! You're getting stronger by the day!|
60074|#821$#I'm so lucky to be able to fight alongside you!|
60075|#821$#Phew... %s2 was a handful! Are you alright? Are you hurt?|
60076|#822$#How's that? Who's the strongest now?|
60077|#821$#Really? You defeated %s2? That's incredible!|
60078|#821$#Even %s2 was no match. Your reputation is well-deserved!|
60079|#823$#Don't fight it, %s2! Your defeat is inevitable!|
60080|#823$#%s2 turned out to be no challenge at all! You must be disappointed.|

60091|#823$#This %s3 should be very helpful on your adventures.|
60092|#823$#I sure didn't expect to get %s3 from %s2. It looks valuable!|
60093|#823$#Bingo! Partner, I think we just hit the jackpot.|
60094|#821$#Nice! I guess %s2 wasn't such a worthless opponent after all.|
60095|#822$#That %s2 looked just like any other one. Who knew it was carrying such good stuff?|
60096|#823$#Hee hee... I wonder how much I can sell this %s3 for...|
60097|#821$#Isn't this %s3? You've gotten really lucky!|
60098|#822$#Aha! Perseverance pays off! I was starting to get bored of those %s2s...|

60103|#822$#Yeah, you got %s3! That's a good sidekick! Um... I mean partner. Yeah.|
60104|#821$#Your backpack is looking kinda heavy... Did you find something valuable?|
60105|#821$#Hooray! It's not easy to obtain %s3.|
60106|#821$#Hooray! It's not easy to obtain %s3.|
60107|#821$#I sure didn't expect a %s2 to be holding onto something so valuable.|
60108|#822$#Is this %s3? What a brilliant luster!|
60109|#821$#%s3? Hyper awesome!

60147|#821$#I hope %s1 isn't always gloomy.|
60148|#821$#I'm sure that you and %s1 can achieve great things if you join forces.|
60149|#821$#Does %s1 also likes to make new friends?|
60150|#821$#Hi, %s1! If you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it!|
60151|#821$#How long has %s1 been adventuring?|
60152|#821$#I'm sure %s1 will be a great companion for you!|
60153|#822$#It's must be more than just a coincidence that you and %s1 met.|
60154|#821$#It will be a totally new experience for you to get to know %s1!|
60155|#823$What kind of person is %s1? They won't be jealous that you and I are so close, will they? Hee hee...|
60156|#821$#The name %s1 sounds friendly.|
60157|#822$#Keep in contact with %s1, and your friendship will go far.|
60158|#822$#Is %s1 more sensible than you? Maybe you could learn a thing or two from them.|
60159|#823$#Hee hee! %s1's take-no-crap attitude delights me!|
60160|#821$#What did you say your new friend's name was? Oh, %s1... Nevermind, I thought it might have been someone else.|
60161|#823$#%s2 is a wonderful companion that everyone gets along with. You certainly have good taste!|
60162|#823$#Awww, you are finally facing up to your feelings for %s2.|
60163|#823$#Congrats! Always cherish the fantastic bond between you and %s2.|
60164|#823$#Hee hee, I always knew you would like %s2! You two are a perfect match!|
60165|#823$#You and %s2 are really a wonderful match. I'm so happy for you!|
60166|#821$#Congratulations! With the company of %s2, your life will be that much more fulfilling!|
60167|#823$#I'm so touched that I could burst into tears. Promise me that you will love and cherish %s2 forever!|
60168|#822$#%s2 is a partner that can be relied on. You better work hard so you're just as reliable!|
60169|#822$#Are you sure about this price for %s1? Have you compared it with prices elsewhere?|
60170|#822$#You're thinking of buying %s1? Is that really the best use of your money?|
60171|#822$#Wow! This %s1 isn't bad at all. If you see anything else this good, you should buy it right away!|
60173|#822$#Wow, the %s1 you auctioned off has been bought. I never thought that someone would go for that price...|
60175|#821$#Isn't this %s1? Do you think you may have paid too much for it? Remember to shop around!|
60176|#821$#Wow, you must be feeling generous today! That's a healthy price for a %s1!|
60177|#824$#Do some price checking before you buy something next time. You shouldn't need to pay that much for %s1.|
60179|#821$#Nice! %s1 has been sold. Any moment now we will be millionaires, right?|
60180|#823$#Ha ha, another chump has bought your overpriced %s1. Even I can't help but laugh!|
60181|#823$#My, you have good taste! This %s1 is of the highest quality.|
60182|#823$#You should teach a class on bargaining! I can't believe you got %s1 for that price.|
60183|#821$#Maybe you should have shopped around before paying that much.|
60184|#822$#The %s1 you auctioned has been sold. Maybe you ask for a bit more money next time.|
60186|#822$#Nice! The sale of %s1 has earned you some cash. Go sell some more stuff!|
60187|#821$#You do have impeccable taste. You picked the finest %s1 out of so many others.|
60188|#824$#Are you finally done shopping? I'm bored half to death.|
60189|#824$#Highway robbery! That %s1 is way too expensive!|
60190|#822$#Well, %s1 has been auctioned off... But I think it should have gone for more than that.|
60191|#821$#Aren't we partners? Where's my cut of the auction money for %s1?|
60193|#821$#Now's the time to buy %s1. It will only get more expensive if you wait.|
60194|#822$#You'll never get rich if you only buy stuff. Put some things up for sale!|
60195|#821$#I wonder why the seller wanted to part with such a high quality %s1.|
60196|#821$#That price for %s1 is too low. You should raise it by 10% or so.|
60198|#821$#The %s1 that you put up for auction has sold. You're well on your way to being rich!|
60199|#821$#That's a good buy! %s1 ought to be very useful.|
60200|#822$#Well, what's done and done. No point in regretting paying such a ridiculous price.|
60201|#824$#%s1? Really? What's useful about one of those? Is there something you're not telling me?|
60202|#821$#Excellent! You've sold %s1 for all kinds of cash! We can live it up tonight.|
60204|#821$#Another one sold! %s1 must be quite popular.|
60205|#821$#I hope it's true when they say "you get what you pay for." At this price, %s1 had better be top-notch.|
60206|#824$#I'd thought you were going to buy me something nice, but instead you came back with %s1...|
60207|#821$#The auction house has all sorts of interesting stuff up for sale! We could be here a while...|
60208|#822$#You made a ton of scratch by selling %s1. Don't spend it all in one place!|
60211|#824$#This %s1 feels strange... Is it used?|
60212|#822$#You've been at the auction house forever... Did you buy anything?|
60213|#823$#Wow! That price has to be a mistake! Buy it now before they fix it!|
60214|#824$#Check it out... That %s1 you auctioned off sold out in no time! You should have listened to me and sold it for a more!|
60216|#823$#Wow, I never could have expected you'd get that much for %s1. Maybe you have a future as a merchant after all!|
60217|#821$#That %s3 you just refined is glittering! Your craftsmanship keeps getting better and better!|
60218|#823$#Your %s2 skill has improved tremendously.|
60219|#822$#Nice! Your %s2 skill has improved so much that you can refine %s3 now!|
60220|#821$#Looks like you've gotten the hang of refining %s2.|
60221|#821$#The luster! The shine! This impeccable %s3 is a sign of your incredible craftsmanship.|
60222|#823$#Keep at it! You'll master the art of crafting %s3 soon enough.|
60223|#821$#You seem to enjoy manufacturing %s3.|
60224|#823$#The %s3 you just made is of near perfect quality.|
60225|#823$#It's no easy task to churn out a %s2. How about you start by practicing with %s3?|
60226|#821$#You've been at it all day just to make a %s3?|
60227|#822$#You certainly have good taste! I've heard that %s2 is quite popular these days.|
60228|#821$#You made this %s3? It's of unmatched quality! Seems like you put a lot of effort into making it.|
60229|#821$#Crafting %s3 requires a strong yet supple technique that few have mastered. Well done!|
60230|#821$#Your crafting skills are getting to be top-notch. You refined %s3 without breaking a sweat!|
60231|#822$#You've been spending a lot of time working on %s2 lately. Why's that?|
60232|#821$#You look so skillful when you are making %s2. You can probably even taken in your own apprentices!|
60233|#822$#There's nothing wrong with focus, but maybe you could make something other than %s3 once in a while.|
60234|#821$#Check out this exquisite %s3! It's hard to believe how your skills at making %s2 have progressed.|
60235|#821$#It must be tough to make %s3... Here's a hanky to deal with all of that sweat.|
60236|#822$#Your skill at making %s2 has improved tremendously! Why not try your hand at making some other stuff?|
60237|#821$#After looking around at all the other %s3, I can say that the one that you made is the best!|
60238|#824$#Oh, my, you are a mess. Maybe you need to stop making %s3 and take a shower.|
60239|#822$#Keep at it! You've been studying %s2 for so long, but only managed to make %s3. You'll get there eventually!|
60240|#822$#The layman would think that this %s3 is exquisite... No that's not a compliment, I'm only saying that my standards are much higher.|

60321|#821$#Nice job! The work you've done on %s1 makes it look like an entirely new piece of gear!|
60322|#822$#Check those stats! This ought to make the road ahead much smoother.|
60323|#822$#This %s1 is the result of blood, sweat and tears. Oh, and toil! Everyone always forgets about toil for some reason...|
60324|#821$#I'm impressed! It takes quite a lot of work to fortify %s1 to this level.|
60325|#822$#That's quite a bit of time and money you've invested in fortifying that up to +%s2.|
60326|#821$# I never thought that I would actually see a %s1 that has been fortified to +%s2! Can't wait to see how great it can be!|
60327|#822$#This shiny piece of gear is sure to grab everyone's attention!|
60328|#823$#Yes! Happy times! A newly fortified piece of gear always makes my day better.|
60329|#821$#An upgraded version of %s1 ought to be quite useful.|
60330|#822$#Yes! Bigger numbers! Higher stats! Fortifying is AWESOME!|
60331|#821$#Check out the shine on %s1 after you fortified it to +%s2! It's like it's brand new!|
60332|#823$#Good call! %s2 is certainly worth fortifying.|
60333|#822$#Fortification is super cost-effective! Especially up to +%s2, where the stat boost is huge.|
60334|#823$#Nice! Yet another piece of rare gear fortified!|
60335|#822$#I heard a rumor that if %s1 is fortified to +%s2, it will shine in the moonlight.|
60336|#821$#You've been working for so long to foritfy this to +%s2... Now it's time to go show it off!|
60337|#823$#Ha! I'd be unstoppable if I could use %s1!|
60338|#822$#I told you that fortifying up to +%s2 is no big deal.|
60339|#821$#Your newly fortified %s1 is like a whole new item. Go find some monsters to test it out on!|
60340|#823$#Hmmm, I wonder how much this +%s2 %s1 would go for at the Auction House...|
60341|#821$#It was tough work getting this %s1, so take good care of it.|
60342|#822$#Who needs Legendary gear? Keep fortifying %s1 until it's just as good!|
60343|#821$#Congrats! You've fortified %s1 to +%s2! This should be worth all kinds of gold!|
60344|#823$#Oooh... Now that %s1 has been fortified, it's emitting a powerful aura. It's almost like it's alive!|
60345|#821$#I'd take something that you've fortified and made your own over some frou-frou gear on the sale rack!|
60346|#823$#You know... I can be fortified too... FEED ME!|
60347|#822$#A freshly-fortified %s1 looks great on you!|
60348|821$#I gotta hand it to you... Fortifying %s1 up to +%s2 isn't easy!|
60349|#821$#Fortification is fun! I always get a nice, warm, fuzzy sensation when it's successful!|
60350|#822$#%s1 is a piece of gear befitting a hero like yourself!|
60351|#822$#Am I missing something? Why are you spending so much time fortifying %s1?|
60352|#821$#Good job! Having a beefed-up %s1 should definitely make your battles easier!|
60353|#821$#Shiny! This newly fortified %s1 is quite a sight!|
60354|#821$#What's the secret to fortifying up to +%s2? I promise I won't tell anyone!|
60355|#822$#Another successful fortification! Today's your lucky day!|
60356|#821$#Ah, so you've fortified %s1 up to +%s2! Do you mean to use it yourself, or to sell it?|
60357|#822$#There will be nothing to fear with a +s2 %s1!|
60358|#822$#Lookit those stats go! You'll definitely be more effective with this.|
60359|#821$#Did you know that I'm lucky? If you give me all your gold coins, I can guarantee a successful fortification!
#823$#No? Drat! Sometimes I wish you were more gullible.|
60360|#822$#Well, well! Fortifying %s1 to +%s2 shows that you have plenty of time and money...  Why don't you fortify my equipment as well?|
60361|#822$#Why don't you find a monster to try your new %s2 out on?|
60362|#821$#%s2 is a super useful skill! Go pick a fight and try it out!|
60363|#822$#Personally, I'm a huge fan of %s2. But don't let me tell you what to do...|
60364|#821$#%s2 is a very useful supplemental skill. Make good use of it!|
60365|#821$#I'm impressed that you've mastered %s2! Let's take it out for a test spin!|
60366|#822$#Was it good for you? %s2 is really powerful, isn't it?|
60367|#821$#Is.... Is that %s2? When did you learn such a crazy skill?|
60368|#822$#Judicious use of %s2 can see you through even the toughest battles.|
60369|#821$#By making good use of %s2, you can live up to your potential.|
60370|#822$#You look different after learning %s2. Almost like you're more experienced and capable.|
60371|#821$#Holy cow, you learned %s2? That's a really rare skill!|
60372|#822$#Advanced Masteries are tough to come by. If you happen across any Mastery books for your skills in the Auction House, don't hesitate to drop some coin on them.|
60373|#821$#%s2 has opened up a ton of new possibilities for battle. Try it out!|
60374|#822$#Give %s2 a whirl as your primary damage dealing skill. I think you might like what it can do!|
60375|#821$#%s2 might seem like a simple buff, but it's actually quite robust.|
60376|#821$#%s2 can save your skin in tough dungeons. Use it!|
60377|#823$#Whaaa? You've learned %s2? You have to teach me when you've got some time.|
60378|#821$#Oh, man, that must be %s2! I can feel it's power all the way over here!|
60379|#821$#Totally radical! You've learned %s2! I feel bad for anyone who gets in your way now!|
60380|#823$#With your new %s2 skill and my all-out attacks, nothing can stand in our way!|
60381|#821$#%s2 is one of those super-handy skills that can dramatically shorten a battle.
#822$#Yes, I meant it would shorten it in your favor!|
60382|#822$#Excellent! You've learned %s2, making us an even more lethal combination!|
60383|#822$#%s2 is pretty strong, I'll admit. But don't rely too heavily on it. The key to victory is adaptability!|
60384|#821$#Hooray! I love it when new skills are discovered! Let's go try it out, shall we?|
60385|#821$#With the %s2 Mastery, you're certain to be the... wait for it... Master of the battlefield! Ha ha! Sigh...|
60386|#821$#Wow, %s2 puts some of your other skills to shame! I say learn as many Masteries as you can!|
60387|#822$#Remember that's it not always about brute strength! Take a look at what %s2 can do for you, and find a strategy that works.|
60388|#823$#You're certain to be even stronger now that you've learned another Mastery.|
60389|#821$#Oooh, I've heard about %s2! Supposedly it's an incredibly old a technique created by a legendary Envoy of Gaia.|
60390|#821$#Way to get your hands on %s2! It's an incredibly rare Mastery!|
60391|#821$#Even the biggest, baddest bosses will tremble before the might of %s2! Tremble, I say!|
60392|#822$#Dungeon, shmungeon. With %s2 in your repertoire, they'll all be a piece of cake!|
60393|#821$#Wow! The moment you learned %s2, I could sense a great increase in your power.|
60394|#823$#Let's head to the battlefield to give %s2 a try!|
60395|#822$#Masteries come from the heart as much as the muscles. You have to focus and study for many hours; you can't just go through the motions.|
60396|#821$#Woo! %s2 is a super-powerful skill that can only be learned after long hours of study.|
60397|#821$#Congrats on mastering %s2! Keep training and learning new skills, and you'll soon be the best Envoy around!|
60398|#822$#Was that %s2? When did you learn that? Have you been studying when I'm not looking?|
60399|#821$#%s2 is, like, redonkulously powerful! No wonder they call it a Mastery!|
60400|#824$#I wish I knew some of your Masteries... Perhaps I can study %s2 the next time we have a break.|
60401|#821$#Masteries are all kinds of useful. You should learn as many as you can.|
60402|#823$#Nicely done! Not everyone can get the hang of %s2.|
60403|#823$#%s2 sure made short work of those baddies!|
60404|#823$#Tee hee... I look forward to seeing the enemy grovel for mercy when faced with your potent %s2.|
60405|#822$#Another Mastery? Looks like you're a quick study.|
60406|#821$#Finally, a new skill! %s2 should be able to spice up your fighting style... I didn't want to say anything, but it's been kinda bland for a while.|
60407|#824$#Oh, wow, was that %s2? It looked like a magic trick, except by "trick" I mean "lots of wicked damage."|
60408|#822$#%s2 should give you a nice boost during your adventures, provided you actually know how to use it.|
60409|#821$#Did you just reset your Skill Points? You should plan them out a bit more carefully this time.|
60410|#821$#Give some thought to how you want to develop before you go throwing points around all willy-nilly.|
60411|#821$#Something's different about you. New haircut, maybe? You have a different air about you than usual.|
60412|#821$#Just like a healthy diet, you want a healthy balance to your skill points as well.|
60413|#821$#Take a moment to plan out where you want to go before you go tossing points about.|
60414|#823$#It's okay, we all make mistakes. Just... don't make a habit of it.|
60415|#821$#What's this? I think you may have become a bit more charming after resetting your skill points...|
60416|#821$#Giving your skill points another try? Cool. Might I suggest putting everything into DMG?
#822$#Too bad those DEF points have to go to boring things. Why can't they go to DMG as well? So unfair...|
60417|#821$#HP Potions are the lifeblood of any adventurer. Make sure you always have some on hand!|
60418|#822$#It seems obvious, but if your health gets low you should quaff an HP potion right away!|
60419|#821$#Oh my, what did you eat? You seem so full of vim and vigor!|
60420|#822$#I've heard that %s2 is the tops when it comes to gourmet cuisine. I'd like to taste it!|
60421|#821$#You need to eat regularly so you have the energy to fight monsters. Three square meals a day!
#822$#I wonder why they call them "square" meals...|
60422|#822$# I can feel the energy inside you! Is it what %s2 does to you?|
60423|#821$#There's no shame in needing to choke down an HP Potion. And even if there was shame, you'd at least still be alive to feel it!|
60424|#824$#You needed an HP Potion already? That was fast! Maybe we should head over to the armor shop...|
60425|#821$#Ooh, %s2 looks yummy... Can I have a bite?|
60426|#822$#Holy mackerel! Where'd this strength come from?|
60427|#821$#I don't know if I can eat this! Knowing how much time someone must have spent on it, it'd be like eating a work of art!|
60428|#821$#An excellent choice! %s2 is the kind of food that's perfect fuel for fightin'!|
60429|#821$#Don't take this the wrong way, but... Maybe instead of relying so heavily on HP Potions you should, I don't know... get better at fighting?|
60430|#821$#Careful! Your health is really low!|
60431|#823$#You should take it easy after eating a big meal. Give it an hour or two so your stomach can settle.|
60432|#823$#Ooh la la! %s2 is a dish that's in high demand! I heard it's a delicacy for even the Navean nobility!|
60433|#821$#You can have your Paleo-Atkins-Homeopathic nonsense. I'll take a good old-fashioned %s2 any day!|
60434|#821$#Oh my, something smells delish! What is it?|
60435|#821$#That meal was... interesting. I think I need to gargle some bleach.|
60436|#821$#HP Potions are your friend! You're supposed to drink your friends, right?|
60437|#822$#You know what they call someone who eats all sorts of delicious food and doesn't share? Jerk. They call them a jerk.|
60438|#823$#%s2? I think I saw Gordon Oliver cooking that on the FoodView TV network last night!|
60439|#822$#Why do you have so many %s2s? Are they all presents for me? Oh, you shouldn't have!|
60440|#821$#Are you full? I'm full AND sleepy. Let's take a nap somewhere. I get to be the big spoon!|
60441|#821$#Be careful! Remember that once you suck down an HP Potion, you can't drink another one for a while.|
60442|#821$#You know... your health is kinda low. Maybe an HP Potion wouldn't be a bad idea.|
60443|#822$#Crikey! If you eat that quickly, you're certain to get a stomachache!|
60444|#821$#%s2 is good for circulation, and circulation is good for being in top fightin' condition!|
60445|#822$#I've heard that %s2 is incredibly difficult to manufacture. Every step is very precise and difficult.|
60446|#821$#%s2 is the latest and greatest! You little trendsetter...|
60447|#821$#Come on, stick with it! We're just getting warmed up!|
60448|#822$#HP Potions really aren't that expensive, so there's no need to be stingy with them. It's your life, after all.|
60449|#822$#Ooh, that smells wonderful! I will totally claim to be on a diet while stealing bites when you're not looking.|
60450|#824$#You must really like %s2. I never understood. Give me simple proteins and carbohydrates, not this overly elaborate mumbo-jumbo you call "cooking."|
60451|#822$#Ah, now this is the way to enjoy %s2! If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't... Oh, am I not allowed to finish that quote?|
60452|#821$#Stop stuffing your face and let's go complete some quests!|
60453|#821$#Here, let me give you a hand with that. What? No, I meant with %s2!|
60454|#822$#I always feel a little bit warm and fuzzy after using %s2.|
60455|#821$# Hey, hey, slow down. Check yourself before you wreck yourself!|
60456|#821$#Did you like %s2? Let me cook it for you sometime!|
60457|#822$#Wow, you look like you have really 'enjoyed' that food. Here, have a napkin.|
60458|#821$#Aww, you look adorable when you are eating!|
60459|#824$#Don't be ashamed of a well-timed HP Potion! There's no point in being brave if it gets you killed.|
60460|#824$#Are you feeling sick? Maybe you should try some %s2.|
60461|#824$#Holy cow! Another meal? Careful, at this rate you'll swell up like a balloon!|
60462|#822$#Is that %s2? I love %s2! I was surprised to find that you humans actually know a thing or two about food.|
60463|#821$#You ate without me? How could you?|
60464|#823$#You should slow down and chew your food. Eating %s2 too quickly will give you a stomachache.|
60465|#821$#Hey, you've been stunned! Snap out of it!|
60466|#821$#Wake up! Don't make me do this by myself!|
60467|#821$#It's a good thing you're wearing good gear; even though the enemy has reduced your DEF, you're still pretty hardy.|
60468|#821$#They're sapping your attack power? Don't worry, I'll make up the difference!|
60469|#821$#Don't panic! This curse is only temporary.|
60470|#821$#Hmm. Something about this flame looks strange...|
60471|#821$#Hey, I'm frozen over here... Get me out!|
60472|#821$#Nice! You shrugged off that huge electricial current without so much as a scratch!|
60473|#821$#This may be a weak poison, but it can be deadly if you ignore it for too long.|
60474|#821$#Just hold on! The ice should melt soon.|
60475|#821$#It's nice to slow down once in a while, right?|
60476|#821$#Watch out! A powerful attack is coming!|
60477|#821$#Are you okay? Can you stand?|
60478|#821$#Uh oh, you've been knocked out! Hang on!|
60479|#821$#Hey, no sleeping on the job! Wake up!|
60480|#821$#Your defenses are down! Get behind me while I try and draw their fire.|
60481|#821$#It's not the end of the world to fight without your weapon, is it? You're pretty burly without it.|
60482|#821$#You look famished! Let's go get some food.|
60483|#821$#Bah! It's just a little fire. No biggie!|
60484|#821$#You won't let a puny little ice cube get you down, right?|
60485|#821$#If the usual stuff isn't working, then maybe you should switch up your tactics.|
60486|#821$#Pain is weakness leaving the body!|
60487|#821$#So your legs are frozen. That's no big deal. You can still fight!|
60488|#821$#Wow, you're moving like you're old and crippled.|
60489|#821$#No, no, you're doing it all wrong. Go bigger! Go stronger!|
60490|#821$#Ha! These enemies are pathetic!|
60491|#821$#Relax. The dizziness should pass soon.|
60492|#821$#It's important to keep a clear head! Taking a nap in the middle of a battle is a bad idea.|
60493|#821$#If the enemy has worn away your defenses, maybe you should beat a hasty retreat and try again later.|
60494|#821$#You've only been temporarily weakened. Fight through it and you'll be right as rain in no time!|
60495|#821$#This curse... It really stinks!|
60496|#821$#Stop, drop and roll! STOP, DROP AND ROLL!|
60497|#821$#Brr! As soon as this ice melts, I'm going for a mug of hot cocoa.|
60498|#821$#I know this is a bit late, considering you're already paralyzed... But maybe try avoiding those kinds of attacks in the future? Just saying...|
60499|#821$#Hey-o, Captain Obvious here. You should get this poison cured as soon as possible.|
60500|#821$#Seeing you stuck there in that block of ice gives me a fabulous idea: mojitos!|
60501|#821$#Don't get in a head-on fight when you're slowed down like this. Try and avoid battle until you go back to normal.|
60502|#821$#That looked like it hurt! I'm glad I got out of the way... Oh, I mean, hey, are you okay?|
60503|#821$#Lookout! A big attack is coming!|
60504|#821$#You're feeling dizzy and are having trouble moving? Did you forget your flu shot this year?|
60505|#821$#Are you sleepy? Maybe you should go to bed earlier! Or drink SIX BILLION CUPS OF COFFEE.|
60506|#821$#Wow, the enemy tore right through your armor! Tee, hee, nice underpants!|
60507|#821$#That was it? You must be weak with hunger; let's call out for a pizza.|
60508|#821$#Um... Your shadow just turned and smiled at me... I think you should get this curse lifted ay-sap.|
60509|#821$#No, you can NOT give me a hug while you are on fire!|
60510|#821$#You're as cold as ice! You're willing to saaaaacrifice our love!
#824$#What? I like singing. Don't look at me like that.|
60511|#821$#You went and got yourself paralyzed, huh. Nice work.|
60512|#821$#Have you looked in a mirror lately? Your skin is turning kind of green. Have you thought about getting that poison cured?|
60513|#821$#Looks kind of cold in there. No, I will not be joining you.|
60514|#821$#Less Tortoise, more Achilles!|
60515|#821$#Why are you being so hard on yourself? You should be hard on the enemy!|
60516|#821$#Yipes! That seems like the sort of attack that could one-shot me. I'm glad it didn't connect.|
60517|#821$#You know, you can fortify your gear so you take less damage while dizzy.|
60518|#821$#WAKE UP! This is hardly the time to be sleeping!|
60519|#822$#Be careful! Your defense has been reduced a bunch.|
60520|#821$#Nice punch! I had no idea you were so tough without your weapon.|
60521|#822$#You seem weak. Are you okay?|
60522|#821$#Oh my, you're burning up! Where's a fire extinguisher when you need one...|
60523|#821$#Good thing your gear isn't affected by the cold! It'd be a shame if it froze and then shattered.|
60524|#821$#Hey, why'd you stop moving? Are you stuck? Have you gone numb?|
60525|#824$#Sniff sniff... What's that smell?|
60526|#821$#That creepy magical ice will be gone soon... Just deal with it.|
60527|#821$#Hey, buddy, you okay? Your vital signs are dropping!|
60528|#821$#Careful! A huge attack is coming!|
60529|#822$#Bah! Only a flesh wound!|
60530|#823$#I'll fight in your place until the dizziness wears off!|
60531|#824$#That's cool, I'll be fine on my own. I'm completely okay with fighting all these enemies single-handedly while you take a nice, refreshing nap.|
60532|#822$#Take a few steps back, champ! Your defense is down significantly right now.|
60533|#824$#Do you feel a bit useless without your weapon? Looks like someone needs more training!|
60534|#821$#Oh no, you've been cursed! Ewwwww.|
60535|#821$#I couldn't help but notice that you've been set on fire. Did you know that the latest auraPhone has an app to fix that?|
60536|#821$#You look so sad and pale encased in that ice cube. I'd offer to help, but... I'm just not a fan of the cold. You'll be fine.|
60537|#821$#Mind over matter! Just focus, and those paralyzed nerves will start responding again in no time!|
60538|#821$#You might want to try dodging the attack that can poison you. The best medicine is prevention!|
60539|#822$#Just ignore all that frozen icy stuff, and keep on fighting!|
60540|#821$#Being slow isn't the end of the world. Unless the world is a race! No, that'd be weird.|
60541|#821$#Wear your battle scars with pride! They serve as reminders of the challenges you have overcome.|
60542|#821$#Hey, are you okay? I'm impressed you survived that!|
60543|#821$#Are you feeling dizzy? It's okay, I often have that effect on people.|
60544|#822$#Oooh, is it naptime already? Good thing I brought this blanket along!|
60545|#821$#Don't worry! I'll keep you safe!|
60546|#821$#You're fighting without a weapon now? That looks like fun! I wanna try it, too!|
60547|#821$#Looks like you need a nurse to treat this curse before you end up in a hearse! Or worse!|
60548|#821$#Have you seen the youtubes of that guy on fire? That's EXACTLY what you look like right now!|
60549|#821$#Are you cold? I know a thing or two that might warm you up...
#824$#What? No, I have a blanket here. What were you thinking about?|
60550|#821$#Are you feeling numb? Fortunately for you, I just earned my certificate in Deep-Tissue Bikram Jackhammer Massage Type Zero! Hai-yaa!|
60551|#822$#That poison is totally gross; it's making you foam at the mouth! Wha... EWW! GET AWAY FROM ME!|
60552|#821$#Ohmygosh! It's so cold in here, I can barely... Hey! What are you staring at?|
60553|#821$#Oh, you've slowed down a bunch! That's okay, it's good to take it slow every now and then.|
60554|#824$#Eek! A big attack is coming! I know, I'll hide behind you!|
60555|#822$#I'm glad I have you to protect me! I don't like the thought of some big meanie beating me up...|
60556|#822$#Focus! Keep it together! The spins will go away soon!|
60557|#821$#Wake up, sleepyhead! There's stuff to do!|
60558|#822$#What happened to you? You used to be so fearless...|
60559|#824$#My, my, you're nothing without your weapon, are you? Stop cowering behind me and stand up for yourself!|
60560|#823$#The wailing of the spirits that are haunting you is kind of amusing.|
60561|#821$#Oh my, your face is so red! Are you feeling alright?|
60562|#822$#What happened? Your hands are like ice! In fact, they ARE ice!|
60563|#822$#No, this won't do at all. Snap out of it! You have to be able to move so you can continue to serve me!|
60564|#824$#Seriously? That meager attack has left you envenomated? Looks like you need to toughen up a bit.|
60565|#823$#The coating of crystal-clear ice across your body is quite striking. I want a picture. Keep still! Right, you can't move, of course you'll keep still...|
60566|#822$#Ugh, come on! We haven't got all day, slowpoke!|
60567|#823$#Why are you wasting your time with these feeble enemies? Let's go after something challenging!|
60568|#824$#You couldn't even dodge that ridiculously slow attack? I wonder about you sometimes...|
60569|#821$#It was tough sledding, but you finally completed %s1! Now people are starting to take notice of your exploits.|
60570|#822$#Ka-ching! The reward for %s1 makes the effort well worth it.|
60571|#822$#Finally! It seemed like that quest took forever to finish up!|
60572|#821$#Good call on taking on %s1 from the bulletin board.|
60573|#821$#Easy-peasy! I could have handled %s1 in my sleep!|
60574|#823$#Low risk, high reward! Quests like %s1 are awesome!|
60575|#823$#Another quest handled, another notch in my belt! What's next?|
60576|#821$#Wow! The person who entrusted us with %s1 sure is generous! This reward is amazing!|
60577|#823$#It took a lot of hard work to finish up %s1. Maybe now is a good time to take a break.|
60578|#823$#Yes! Another quest in the bag. Are we good at this or what?|
60579|#821$#Mirabelle's bulletin board is a great place to sharpen your skills. The rewards aren't too shabby, either.|
60580|#822$#%s1 was kind of weird. Even though it's over, I'm still not sure exactly what happened.|
60581|#824$#Geez, finally! %s1 was exhausting! Who knew it would be such a pain?|
60582|#821$#You took on %s1 because you want to help people, right? Not just because of the reward?|
60583|#822$#Yes! That's done! Now, I say it's naptime.|
60584|#821$#What a wacky request! %s1 just goes to show the world is a weird place.|
60585|#821$#You did such a bangup job on %s1, people are really starting to take notice of you!|
60586|#822$#Keep taking on quests like %s1, and you'll be famous before you know it.|
60587|#821$#What a trip! I never expected that...|
60588|#822$#The person who commisioned %s1 sure was appreciative of your efforts!|
60589|#821$#Yeah! %s1 has left me all fired up! I haven't gotten to show my stuff like that in a while.|
60590|#822$#Keep it up! Your hard work on quests like %s1 has helped a lot of people.|
60591|#821$#Good thing you accepted this quest! I think anyone else would have crashed and burned.|
60592|#824$#Seriously? This is all we get for %s1? That's hardly fair...|
60593|#821$#We are rolling in dough after completing %s1! Happy-happy!|
60594|#822$#I don't want to seem like I'm riding your coattails or anything, but I sure couldn't have handled %s1 on my own.|
60595|#821$#I had a good feeling about this quest ever since we first looked at it on the board.|
60596|#821$#I hope everything we do in the future is as interesting as %s1 was.|
60597|#822$#So you've finally finished this troublesome task... Can we please move on to something interesting now?|
60598|#824$#If the next quest is going to be as troublesome as %s1 was, let me know so I can think of an excuse to get out of it.|
60599|#822$#These people are so helpless. Can't they do anything for themselves?|
60600|#821$#%s1 is all wrapped up, so what's next?|
60601|#821$#Is %s1 stronger than you?|
60602|#823$#So you've asked %s1 to tag along? Where are you thinking of going?|
60603|#821$#Is %s1 tougher than I am?  I think we might find out very soon!|
60604|#822$#%s1 seems like a worthy ally. The two of you together can surely tackle any obstacle.|
60605|#821$#Is it fate that drew you and %s1 together?|
60606|#823$#With %s1 in the party, you're now twice as strong. Don't hold back!|
60607|#822$#Why are you inviting %s1 along? Do you have a crush on them or something? It's okay, you can tell me.|
60608|#821$#%s1 looks like they know what they're doing. This should be fun!|
60609|#821$#Be polite when you invite %s1 to come along. A first impression is the most important one!|
60610|#823$#%s1 seems like they're easy to get along with. This should go smoothly!|
60611|#821$#Yeah, invite %s1 along! It's boring to always go at it alone.|
60612|#822$#Ooh check it out! %s1's gear looks shiny... They must have spent a lot of time and effort fortifying their stuff!|
60613|#821$#I trust your judgement in picking party members!|
60614|#822$#Rrrowr! %s1 is cute!|
60615|#821$# Be careful when you are working with %s1, they might drag you down.|
60616|#822$#%s1? Really? Okay, if you insist...|
60617|#821$#Let's have a super fantastic adventure with %s1!|
60618|#821$#Now that you've roped in some friends, we should tackle something that would be tough to do on your own.|
60619|#821$#If %s1 is gonna lead this group, they'd better be strong.|
60620|#824$#What's %s1 like? You know I can't just follow anybody.|
60621|#821$#I have a feeling that %s1 will be a great leader!|
60622|#823$#Now that you've joined up with %s1's group, you should introduce me to all of your new friends!|
60623|#822$#Who are all of these people in %s1's party? Are they cool?|
60624|#821$#If %s1 leaves the group, I think you should replace them as the leader! Just saying...|
60625|#821$#Is %s1 someone you already knew? If not, remember to introduce yourself.|
60626|#823$#I feel up for more adventures today! Let's see what the people from %s1's group are up to!|
60627|#822$#%s1 seems like they're pretty smart. How do I know? Because they invited us along!|
60628|#821$#If you've agreed to join %s1's group, you must think they're pretty capable. Am I right?|
60629|#821$#Is %s1 taking us somewhere scary and dangerous? Eep! You have to stay by my side at all times!|
60630|#822$#%s1 seems like they know how to take care of their allies. I think this group is a good fit for us!|
60631|#821$#I dunno... %s1 seems kind of shady to me. Like they have an ulterior motive for asking you to join...|
60632|#822$#Have you traveled with %s1 before? I'm curious because you agreed to join up with them without the slightest hesitation.|
62501|Am I doing well?|
62502|Do you remember that time we fought %s2?|
62503|Did you get hurt in a recent battle?|
62504|How do you feel when you defeat an enemy?|
62505|What do you think of our tactics?|
62506|#821$#I've been watching you beat up on one %s2 after another.
#822$#It's pretty obvious that you've gotten a lot stronger.|
62507|#821$#Oh, you were brilliant in that fight against %s2!
#822$#I can remember the whole thing very clearly.|
62508|#824$#I got myself a pickle when I let %s2 get in behind me.
#821$#But thanks to you, I turned out just fine!|
62509|#821$#With victory should come a bit of pride! Why not?
#823$#I noticed that proud look you had when you handed %s2 a beatdown.|
62510|#822$#Oh, yes, it's all down to tactics. That and our ability to coordinate.
#821$#Just look what happens when we use our Combo Attack. Nothing stands a chance!|
62511|How am I doing out there?|
62512|%s2 doesn't bother you at all, do they?|
62513|What's the difference between you and I in terms of strength?|
62514|Can we spar sometime?|
62515|How did I do when we fought %s2?|
62516|#821$#Very well, I'd say! I barely had to help out at all against %s2.
#822$#It makes me feel confident to fight alongside you.|
62517|#821$#Bah! %s2 is no challenge at all.
#822$#We should be going after bigger marks!|
62518|#821$#Ha! You've still got a ways to go!
#823$#But you are coming up fast. I don't think it will take you very long to match me.|
62519|#821$#Perhaps! I wouldn't want to hurt you, though.
#823$#Ha ha! Just kidding!|
62520|#821$#Fabulously well! I was impressed.
#822$#%s2 could barely touch you!|
62521|How do you think the battle with %s2 went?|
62522|Do you have any tips for fighting %s2?|
62523|What's that you're writing? Is it a diary?|
62524|How is our Combo Skill coming along?|
62525|How can I become a better fighter?|
62526|#821$#You tore through a huge group of %s2 not too long ago.
#822$#I was super impressed!|
62527|#822$#Even though %s2 isn't much of a threat, you can't forget about them entirely.
#821$#Never hurts to be careful!|
62528|#821$#...huh?
#822$#Oh! Oh, nothing. I was just, um, writing down... Your battle records!
#823$#According to this, you've fought... um... A billion %s2! Nice job!|
62529|#822$#You mean our Super Synchronized Transcendental Combo Version 2.718?
#821$#It's unstoppable! We tore through a whole pack of %s2 with it.|
62530|#822$#Just keep going the way you are going!
#821$#You keep getting tougher every day.|
62531|Why were you smiling when we fought %s2?|
62532|Are you avoiding me?|
62533|Did you get hurt in that fight with %s2?|
62534|Why so serious?|
62535|You look bored.|
62536|#821$#Because I was impressed!
#823$#You tore through %s2 like it was nothing! How could I not crack a smile?|
62537|#821$#I dunno... That look you had on your face as you tore through %s2...
#824$#Do you have a ruthless side to you?|
62538|#824$#Nothing serious. Just a few broken bones, some internal bleeding, and a partially barfed-up heart.
#822$#Ha! Just kidding. Do you really think a mere %s2 can hurt me?|
62539|#821$#Oh I was just reminiscing on how quickly you tore through %s2...
#822$#Are you going to do that again? Or are we moving on to bigger baddies?|
62540|#824$#Yep. Fighting these puny enemies is dull as dishwater.
#821$#Let's go find a real challenge!|
62541|Is it just me, or have things been kind of dull lately?|
62542|What do you think of our Combo Attack?|
62543|We seem to be working together well.|
62544|What's up? You seem extra cheerful today.|
62545|Do you remember that time we fought %s2?|
62546|#822$#To you, maybe. To me, just being alive is an adventure!
#821$#That being said, it does get kind of boring to fight so many %s2... Maybe we could switch it up.|
62547|#822$#Yes! By our powers combined, we can defeat any foe!
#821$#...what? Was that over the top?|
62548|#821$#I completely agree!
#822$#Our teamwork is evident when we mop up %s2 by the dozen.|
62549|#821$#I do? I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary.
#822$#I just can't help but be in a good mood when I see you getting stronger day by day.|
62550|#821$#Of course I do! That was a scrap for the history books!
#822$#We should go find an even bigger baddie to take down.|
62551|Why are you staring at me? Is there something on my face?|
62552|How do you feel about our tactics?|
62553|Hang on a second, I think I need a rest.|
62554|How do you think I did against %s2?|
62555|What's wrong? Are you feeling okay?|
62556|#823$#Oh, no, nothing like that.  I was just wondering...
#823$#You're really strong, but you're so skinny! Where does it all come from?|
62557|#823$#Wait... We have tactics? I've just been charging in headlong and beating up the nearest monster!
#821$#I supose that's technically a tactic...|
62558|#822$#Chin up! Everyone gets tired after a while.
#821$#Take a minute to collect yourself if you need to, then let's get back at it!|
62559|#822$Against %s2 you showed a ton of potential.
#821$Keep training, and pretty soon you'll be unstoppable!|
62560|#824$#Hmph! No. Frustrated. I wasn't really at my best in that fight against %s2.
#821$#You totally showed me up! ARGH!|
62561|Why is your face red?|
62562|What's on your mind?|
62563|What should we do if we get separated in a battle?|
62564|We're friends, right?|
62565|What are you counting up?|
62566|#823$#Oh, I'm just a little flushed. It must be... yeah, that fight with %s2. That's it. Sure.|
62567|#821$#You know, there's a lot more to do than just fight all the time.
#822$#I know! Let's go to Navea and check out the Auction House!|
62568|#822$#You don't need to worry about me. Remember when I took down %s2 all on my own?
#821$#The question is, how will you fare without me?|
62569|#821$#Not just friends! We're friends, partners, confidants, everything!
#823$#Well, maybe not everything... But darn close to it!|
62570|#821$#I'm trying to count up all the %s2 that we've taken down recently!
#822$#Oh no! I don't have enough fingers!|
62571|What do you think of my performance?|
62572|Why are you always staring at me?|
62573|What's with the ultra-serious look?|
62574|Sup? Are you feeling alright?|
62575|Thanks for all the help!|
62576|#824$#Ehhh... It's okay...
#821$#If you want to get better, go destroy a million %s2 with one hand tied behind your back.
#823$#Then do it again with the other hand!|
62577|#823$#Do you think I'm deliberately trying to distract you while you are fighting?
#821$#Perhaps I am. You'll never know.|
62578|#821$#Serious? No, this is my contented expression.
#823$#I enjoy watching you continue to thrash helpless creatures. Keep it up.|
62579|#824$#(Yawn) This is getting boring. Where is the challenge here?
#821$#We should move on to a tougher zone.|
62580|#821$#I help if I must. It'd be a shame if you died and I had to find someone else to pester.
#823$#But it does make me glad you realize that you don't stand a chance without me.|
62581|Do I look cool when I'm fighting %s2?|
62582|What's up with %s2? They seem mysterious...|
62583|How did you feel when we beat %s2?|
62584|Do you think about prior battles often?|
62585|What do you think about our Combo Attack?|
62586|#821$#Eh... It's hard to look cool when you're fighting a namby-pamby like %s2.
#822$#You need to go after some tougher mobs to really impress people!|
62587|#822$#Huh. I wonder what sort of secrets %s2 could be hiding...
#822$#There has to be something going on. How else could they have gotten so powerful?|
62588|#822$#Heroic! You have to face down huge challenges in order to be called a hero.
#821$#The fight against %s2 was certainly that!|
62589|#821$#All the time!
#822$#Take the fight with %s2 for example. It was brilliant!
#824$#We executed perfectly. Even the slightest mistake would have cost us our lives!|
62590|#822$#Have you heard that phrase 'greater than the sum of its parts?'
#821$#When you put the two of us together, we can take on any challenge!|
62591|Do you think I'm good at battling %s2?|
62592|Let's go challenge %s2!|
62593|Do you think %s2 is tough?|
62594|Do you think about that battle against %s2 a lot?|
62595|Have any of our recent battles left you with a strong impression?|
62596|#821$#That fancy move you used to finish off %s2 was amazing!
#822$#I couldn't help but admire it.|
62597|#822$#Why? %s2 is not even a challenge to us.
#821$#Let's go hunt down some tougher enemies!|
62598|#823$#%s2? Bah! I could handle a hundred of them without breaking a sweat.|
62599|#822$#Yes, I think about that more often than I'd care to admit.
#821$#Hm... I suppose that's sort of admitting it, isn't it?  Oh well.|
62600|#821$#You bet! I remember our duel with %s2!
#823$#Action! Drama! Intrigue! It had everything!|
62601|Can we learn from our enemies?|
62602|Does %s2 have a weakness?|
62603|I feel like I've hit a bottleneck...|
62604|You seem different after the battle with %s2.|
62605|How do you get over your frustrations?|
62606|#823$#Of course! 'Know Thine Enemy,' is a common phrase in war.
#822$#By studying your enemy, you can easily understand how to defeat them.|
62607|#822$#You've already faced down %s2 and won... Shouldn't you already know its weakness?
#821$#Or did you do it the hard way?|
62608|#821$#Chin up! You're still alive and you're stronger than you once were.
#822$#Where would you be if you gave up at the very first setback?|
62609|#821$#Oh, %s2. I was certainly lucky that you had my back!
#823$#If I was with anyone else, I might not be around to have this conversation.|
62610|#822$#Frustrations are a part of life. We all deal with them.
#821$#Everyone is different, but you can try thinking of things that have gone well. The battle with %s2, for example.|
62611|Hey! Why are you laughing at me?|
62612|Do remember the time we fought %s2?|
62613|What do you feel like doing?|
62614|What's the secret to success?|
62615|Let's go take on %s2!|
62616|#821$#Ha! No, I wasn't laughing at you.
#823$#I was just remembering something funny from the other day...|
62617|#821$#I remember it vividly!
#823$#I was impressed that you were able to take on %s2 and win!|
62618|#822$#An excellent question! I have no idea!
#821$#The recent battle with %s2 was a thrill; let's go find an even more ambitious target!|
62619|#821$#Optimism is the key to success! You make your own luck in this world.
#822$#Of course, that luck then gets modified by a pseudorandom number generator...
#823$#...which, in general, follows more of a Gaussian distribution than anything truly random...
#821$#...huh? Nevermind, I'm just rambling.|
62620|#821$#Yes! Let's totally go after %s2... Right after my nap!
#822$#Zzzzzz...|
62621|What? Do I have something on my face?|
62622|I feel like I'm in a funk.|
62623|Something troubling you?|
62624|How can I be the best adventurer ever?|
62625|Are scared of %s2?|
62626|#823$#Huh? Ha, no. I wasn't really staring at you. Just spacing out...|
62627|#822$#It happens. Just keep in mind that a lot of people depend on you.
#821$#Even if it becomes a grind, you have to keep at it! Things will turn up eventually!|
62628|#822$#Not at all! When we took %s2 to school, I noticed a strange power coming from you.
#821$#I wonder if that's when you realized you could be a hero.|
62629|#821$#Success is being prepared!
#822$#An adventurer never knows what's going to come, so they have to be ready for anything!
|
62630|#821$#Scared isn't the right word. Fighting %s2 stresses me out.
#822$#It's always goes down to the wire; one wrong move and we're toast!|
62631|Woo! Wasn't that battle with %s2 exciting?|
62632|We should go challenge %s2.|
62633|Yes! We've defeated %s2!|
62634|Remember when we fought %s2?|
62635|Did you get hurt when we were fighting %s2?|
62636|#823$#Totes! When we put our heads together, nothing can stop us!
#821$#%s2 never stood a chance!|
62637|#821$#Really? %s2 is incredibly strong, and you want to challenge them?
#822$#Looks like you're starting to get ambitious! I like it!|
62638|#822$#Don't lose your head; it's only one battle.
#821$#We still have a long road ahead of us. Keep at it!|
62639|#823$#Oh yeah! The battle against %s2 is something I'll always remember.
#821$#Trading blows! Huge hits and near misses! Just when you think it's all wrapped up, out came something new! It was like a movie!|
62640|#822$#(Sigh) I guess I can't hide it from you, can I?
#824$#Yes, I was careless, and %s2 left me with quite a scar.|
62641|How did I look when I fought %s2?|
62642|Remember that time we battled %s2?|
62643|How are you feeling? Are you up to challenging %s2?|
62644|When was the last time you had this much fun?|
62645|Do you have any tricks for winning battles?|
62646|#821$#You were awesome against %s2!
#822$#I think I got distracted and missed my attack.|
62647|#824$#%s2? I was nervous in that fight. I think I slipped and fell at one point, but no one noticed.|
62648|#823$#Heck yeah! With the two of us together, we can take on anything!|
62649|#822$#It was just the other day!
#821$#We taught %s2 a lesson, remember? Those were good times.|
62650|#822$#Ha! As if I'm going to tell you ALL of my secrets...
#821$#I'm not that easy, you know.|
62651|Did you get hurt when we took on %s2?|
62652|What makes you feel good?|
62653|Do you remember the time we fought %s2?|
62654|So... Have any hobbies?|
62655|You're so strict! Can't we relax once in a while?|
62656|#822$#What? How dare you insinuate such a thing!
821$#How could a meager %s2 have any chance of hurting me?|
62657|#823$#What makes me feel good? Taking my enemies and crushing them into a fine powder.
#821$#If you've no better ideas, as I imagine you don't, I say we do more of that today!|
62658|#822$#Oh, that adorable little %s2 was trying sooo hard to attack me...
#823$#You finished it off too quickly! Let me have some fun with it next time.|
62659|#821$#Hobbies? You mean aside from destroying miserable monsters?
#822$#Oh, I suppose sometimes I like taking our prey and stuffing them.
#823$#I made an adorable doll out of %s2 to put on my mantle!|
62660|#824$#No! You still have so much to learn.
#822$#You face one puny %s2 and you're already panting like a dog!
#823$#I require my servants to be in tip-top condition at all times!|
62661|Whatcha thinking about?|
62662|You look lost in thought...|
62663|Do you remember the treasure we picked up after beating %s2?|
62664|Do you wish you had %s3?|
62665|#821$#%s1 must be really lucky to have gotten %s3 off of %s2.
#822$#I guess there really are rewards for hard work!|
62666|#821$#I'm feeling lucky today! I think we're sure to find %s3 if we challenge %s2!
#823$#Lets go as soon as possible!|
62667|#821$#Oh, that? Absolutely!
#823$#I was surprised that %s2 would be carrying something like %s3. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover!|
62668|#822$#Am I that obvious?
#821$#Yes, I've always wanted to have %s3. When you finally picked it up, I could barely contain myself!|
62669|Is there anything you'd like to ask me?|
62670|%s3 is nice... I wish I had more!|
62671|What do you think... Is it time to update my wardrobe?|
62672|What should we do today?|
62673|#824$#Hm? Oh, nothing important.
#822$#I was just curious what you planned to do with %s3.
#821$#It's so valuable, I can't imagine actually using it.|
62674|#821$#It is, isn't it? But we can't always be that lucky.
#822$#I guess if you've got nothing but free time, we could hunt down %s2 and see if we can get one.|
62675|#821$#Fashion is important, I suppose. But so is function!
#822$#Maybe you should check out some new gear, like the %s3 we picked up from %s2.|
62676|#821$#Ugh, I've been feeling lethargic lately. I need to get my blood moving!
#823$#I know! We should go challenge %s2 again! Good exercise and a shot at getting another %s3!|
62677|Do you know how I could get my hands on %s3?|
62678|I'm glad you're here! I couldn't have picked up %s3 without your help.|
62679|What's that book you're looking at?|
62680|How come you keep staring at %s3?|
62681|#821$#Your best bet at getting %s3 is to go after %s2.
#822$#It could take a while, so let's get to it!|
62682|#823$#Aww, you and your flattery...
#821$#No, but seriously... You had as much to do with it as I did. If not more...|
62683|#821$#Oh, this? I was just doing some research. I think a friend of yours just picked up a fancy brand-new %s3.
#822$#Apparently they got it from %s2; maybe we should challenge them as well?|
62684|#822$#This is %s3? I'd thought it would have been bigger and shinier.
#821$#I wouldn't have even thought this was valuable if you hadn't said so.|
62685|You seem upset. What's up?|
62686|What happened that made you so happy? Did you win the lottery or something?|
62687|How come you stare at %s2 whenever we come across them?|
62688|So, I take it you like that %s3...|
62689|#824$#(Sigh) It's been too long since we've found a truly awesome treasure.
#822$#Remember when we found %s3? What a day that was!|
62690|#821$#I just found out that the %s3 a friend of yours picked up is ridiculously valuable.
#822$#Now I want one! Let's track down %s2 and make them cough one up!|
62691|#821$#Oh, was I staring? Sorry! It's just weird to me that something like %s2 would be carrying a %s3...
#821$#Now I'm curious as to what else they have on them.|
62692|#823$#Yes! I'm totally jelly that everyone seems to have a %s3 now.
#821$#I want one of my own!|
62693|What's so special about %s2?|
62694|Do you know how I can get %s3?|
62695|Do you have any tips for going through dungeons?|
62696|Is there something you want?|
62697|#821$#You mean besides the metric ton of XP that %s2 doles out? I think they can also drop %s3!|
62698|#822$#%s2!
#821$#Everyone I know who's gotten %s3 has picked it up from %s2.|
62699|#822$#If you're having trouble getting deep into a tough dungeon, it can help to fortify your gear.
#821$#Of course, you'll find new gear in the dungeon, which then needs to be fortified for the NEXT dungeon, where you find even newer gear...
#824$#It's a neverending cycle!|
62700|#821$#Yes! That %s3 that you picked up recently.
#822$#I want like twenty of those things. They're incredible!|
62701|%s3 is awesome! I want another one!|
62702|Huh. What am I supposed to do with another %s3?|
62703|What's the quickest way to getting stronger?|
62704|Wow! A %s3? It must be our lucky day!|
62705|#821$#Go knock %s2 around again if you want %s3!
#822$#That's where we got it last time, right?|
62706|#822$#%s3 is a valuable piece of gear. If you don't want it, I'm sure a friend of yours can put it to good use.
#821$#If not, there's always the Auction House!|
62707|#824$#An excellent question! I just saw this AuraTube video about a piece of gear that raises your level automatically!
#821$#The comments section was full of people saying it was a scam, but what do they know?|
62708|#822$#Luck? You can call it luck if you want. I prefer to call it DESTINY. Yes, in all caps.
#821$#DESTINY is what brought %s3 to you. You should thank DESTINY.|
62709|Why are you laughing? Did something funny happen?|
62710|What's on the docket for today?|
62711|My gear is starting to get stale. Let's head to the shop!|
62712|I'm feeling generous today. Is there anything you want from the store?|
62713|#822$#Ha! I'm laughing because we keep getting tons of %s3 from %s2!
#821$#We're in the money big time!|
62714|#821$#I was going to suggest that we hunt down %s2.
#822$#I heard you can sometimes get a super-valuable %s3 from them! Ka-ching!|
62715|#821$#Buying better gear is important, but so is being thrifty.
#822$#A lot of good stuff can be found just lying about, like that %s3 you picked up recently.
#823$#And remember: every piece of gold saved is a piece of gold that can be spent spoiling your favorite Eidolon!
$822$#What? YES, OF COURSE I MEANT ME!|
62716|#823$#Aww, thanks hun!
#821$#That %s3 you picked up recently looks pretty snazzy. Can I have one of those?|
62717|Everything seems to have gotten more expensive lately...|
62718|Do you know how to get %s3?|
62719|Time to get rid of some old equipment!|
62720|Did you need something? I thought I heard you say my name...|
62721|#821$#Is that it? I thought you'd been scrimping on dinner lately!
#824$#Ugh! I can't stand being poor! Quick, go sell everything you own! I require filet mignon!|
62722|#824$#Yikes! You forgot already? Can you even remember your own name?
#821$#You get %s3 from %s2, remember? How many times must I remind you?|
62723|#824$#I didn't want to say anything, but they are starting to look pretty tattered...
#822$#Wait... What's that you're putting on? Where did that come from?
#821$#Did you find a rare piece of gear and not tell me about it? How dare you!|
62724|#822$#...yes, with the money I filch from this clueless Envoy, I can certainly buy a new...
#824$#Huh? You! How dare you eavesdrop on me! I'm busy scheming over here!
#823$#Scheming? No! I meant, um, screaming. Yes! I'm busy SCREAMING! EVERYTHING'S FINE! GO AWAY!|
62725|I don't remember anything after we encountered %s2. What happened?|
62726|Is there anything I should know about %s3?|
62727|#824$#You went down like a ton of bricks! I was worried...
#821$#Luckily %s2 lumbered off after that, and I was able to bring you to a doctor.|
62728|#821$#%s3 is a dangerous place because %s2 roams around. They got the better of you last time!|
62729|I can't believe I let %s2 get the better of me! This sucks...|
62730|I'm glad you were there to help last time...|
62731|#821$#Cheer up! It's not that big of a deal.
#822$#So what if %s2 rang your bell? You're still alive, and you can show them what's for next time!|
62732|#824$#You bit off more than you could chew, didn't you?
#821$#It's okay. We're here to watch one another's backs, right? So it's as much my fault as it is yours...|
62733|What's with all those bandages?|
62734|Oh, wow, I feel like a chump after what happened in %s3...|
62735|#821$#Oh these? It never hurts to be prepared!
#822$#Better to have and not need, than need and not have.|
62736|#822$#Don't let it get you down. %s3 was just a temporary setback.
#822$#Let's train up a bit, then challenge %s2 again!|
62737|Losing sucks! How can I make that happen less often?|
62738|What happened after I went down in %s3?|
62739|#821$#Remember that there is no shame in running from a battle you can't win.|
62740|#824$#You went face-first into the dirt!
#822$#I got so filthy carrying you back to town... That was humiliating!|
62741|Hey, thanks for being there to help out...|
62742|What happened to us at %s3? I can't seem to remember...|
62743|#821$#Sure! We are partners, right? We should have each other's backs.
#822$#Just try and be more careful next time. %s2 is no pushover.|
62744|#821$#What happened is that you got your head handed to you by %s2!
#824$#%s3 is a dangerous place. We should make sure we're prepared before we go back.|
62745|I'm a little down on myself after losing to %s2...|
62746|It's my fault we lost against %s2. I dragged us down...|
62747|#821$#Hey, it's cool. Can't win them all!
#822$#I'm sure you'll do much better against %s2 next time.|
62748|#822$#Don't feel bad; it's as much my fault as it is yours!
#824$#I should have been paying more attention, and I let an enemy get in behind you.|
62749|Let's go see what there is to find in %s3.|
62750|I'm glad you had my back last time!|
62751|#821$#Dude! You need to be careful when you're traipsing around %s3!
#822$#I'd hate to see you get knocked out... again...|
62752|#823$#You betcha! That's why I'm here, right?
#822$#Of course, it'd be nice if you didn't need me to bail you out so often...|
62753|What happened when we were in %s3? I don't remember anything...|
62754|I'm glad you were there last time...|
62755|#821$#Looks like you need to do a bit more training, wouldn't you say?
#824$#You let %s2 get right on top of you!|
62756|#821$#You have to keep your wits about you when you're wandering through %s3.
#824$#I don't want to have to find myself a new servant!|
62757|Bah! Taking out %s2 was childs play!|
62758|That was it? %s2 was kind of boring...|
62759|I know everything there is to know about %s2!|
62760|#821$#Yeah! I feel like I could take on a dozen of those guys by myself!|
62761|#823$#%s2 really isn't a challenge anymore... Should we go find some tougher enemies to fight?|
62762|#823$#Wow! You tore through them like a hot knife through butter!
#822$#Huh... That's a weird expression. Do some people actually keep their knives hot?
#824$#Conversely, does that mean that other people would chill their knives? Ahh! Why am I thinking about this?|
62763|That fight against %s2 was kind of rough.|
62764|Am I missing something? Is there a better way to deal with %s2?|
62765|Do you have any hints on how to take on %s2?|
62766|#823$#MOAR POWER, MOAR DAMAGE!
#821$#Sorry... I got carried away for a moment. Yeah... Um, it never hurts to upgrade your weapon!|
62767|#824$#You should hop over to the Secret Stone Merchant and do some inlaying! That could give you the boost you need to handle %s2.|
62768|#821$#When all else fails, there is always the long, slow grind for XP! It's a sure-fire way to level you up... eventually!|
62769|I know %s3 like the back of my hand!|
62770|Man... We mobbed through %s3 like it was nothing!|
62771|I feel like we combed through every nook and cranny of %s3.|
62772|#821$#Yup! I'd say we're pretty familiar with %s3 these days.
#823$#It's starting to feel like a second home to me...|
62773|#821$#Darn skippy! %s3 is nothing to fear.
#823$#I'm thinking of getting a summer home there.|
62774|#821$#All those baddies wandering around are no match for us!
#823$#Traveling across %s3 is like a walk in the park.|
62775|Do you have any tips on how to handle the dangers in %s3?|
62776|This jaunt through %s3 is starting to stress me out...|
62777|Am I missing something? Is there an easier way to handle %s3?|
62778|#822$#Maybe it's time to upgrade your gear.
#821$#You can look for some new stuff, or fortify what you've got.|
62779|#822$#You were almost there! I'm sure it'll be fine next time.|
62780|#821$#Have you given some thought to reallocating your skill points? Maybe a tweak in your setup is all you need.|
62781|Who'd win in a fight: me or %s2?|
62782|I feel really strong lately!|
62783|What do you think of %s2?|
62784|#821$#Pshaw! As if %s2 even stands a chance!
#823$#You'd mop the floor with them!|
62785|#822$#Funny, I was just thinking the same thing!
#823$#I think that fight against %s2 really boosted our confidence!|
62786|#822$#(Yawn) Bo-o-oring! Let's try and find an actual challenge!|
62787|That fight against %s2 was epic!|
62788|What do you say? Should we go train today?|
62789|What's the secret to beating %s2?|
62790|#822$#Yeah, if by 'epic' you mean 'took way longer than it should have.'
#821$#You need a bit of work if you want to win by more than the skin of your teeth!|
62791|#823$#Yes! Let's toughen up a bit so that next time we come across %s2 it'll be a breeze!|
62792|#822$#You're asking the right person! I'm full of advice that'd be mildly useful if it wasn't so vague!
#823$#Deal lots of damage while avoiding or deflecting %s2's big attacks. You see? No problem at all!|
62793|Should we keep fighting %s2?|
62794|%s3 seems like a nice place...|
62795|Fighting %s2 is fun!|
62796|#823$#If you really want to, I suppose...
#823$#But I could beat twenty of them in my sleep! Shouldn't we find some tougher enemies?|
62797|#822$#Really? You think so? To each their own, I guess...
#823$#Wait, was that sarcasm? Ha! I get it!|
62798|#823$#There is something really satisfying about beating up on %s2...|
62799|I'm having a tough time making my way through %s3...|
62800|No one else has trouble with %s2... What's wrong with me?|
62801|Is there an easier way through %s3?|
62802|#824$#You might be just having an off day.
#822$#Maybe give it a rest for a while, and then get back at it!|
62803|#822$#Don't get so down; %s2 has gotta have a weak spot.
#823$#Maybe you should ask one of those other adventurers for advice!|
62804|#824$#Hmm... not that I know of. You may just need to gain a level or two before you give it another go.|
62805|What's on your mind?|
62806|Ha! %s2 is no match for our mightiness!|
62807|I think I'm getting familiar with %s2's fighting style.|
62808|#822$#Oh, not much. Just thinking...
#821$#Actually, I'm curious as to why you're spending so much time fighting %s2. Do they drop some good loot or something?|
62809|#823$#No match whatsoever! Our mightiness is just so... mighty!|
62810|#821$#Familiar? More like omniscient!
#823$#It looks like you know what %s2 is about to do before even they do!|
62811|%s2 was really strong.|
62812|Is there a better way to deal with %s2?|
62813|Is there any hope of beating %s2?|
62814|#822$#Ugh. Yeah. That was tougher than I expected.
#821$#We'll have to brush up our skills if we want to face %s2 again.|
62815|#824$#There has to be! I'm just not sure what it is...|
62816|#822$#The Secret Stone Merchant in town should be able to help tune up your equipment. Support local businesses!|
62817|%s2 is no threat to me!|
62818|Do you think I've gotten stronger?|
62819|It was really easy to tear through %s3.|
62820|#821$#Get your head out of the clouds; it was just %s2!
#822$#It's time to move on to some bigger and badder opponents.|
62821|#821$#I'd say so! You're starting to live up to your potential.
#822$#It wasn't so long ago that you were just a whelp, and now look at you!|
62822|#821$#%s3 just isn't a challenge these days.
#822$#We should take on some tougher dungeons!|
62823|Do you have any tips for making our way through %s3?|
62824|What's up? Want to chat?|
62825|Is there an easier way to get through %s3?|
62826|#822$#You ran into a rough patch. So what? It's not a big deal.
#821$#You'll pull through next time, I'm sure of it!|
62827|#821$#Yeah. I want to ask you something...
#822$#It took you forever to deal with %s2! What's up? Are you feeling okay?|
62828|#821$#%s3 is a strange and dangerous place. Make sure %s2 doesn't back you into a corner!|
62829|Fighting %s2 seems a little too easy...|
62830|Are we being cruel by beating up on %s2?|
62831|I'm in the zone fighting one %s2 after another.|
62832|#821$#It doesn't just seem like it!
#823$#%s2 is so easy, it's a waste of time! Let's go fight tougher monsters!|
62833|#823$#Cruel? Not if %s2 has awesome loot that we need!|
62834|#822$#You could be in the zone, or you could be stuck in a rut.
#827$#You should switch it up and go after something other than %s2!|
62835|That battle against %s2 was a thrill!|
62836|That battle against %s2 was stressful!|
62837|%s2 was super-tough!|
62838|#824$#Um... really? I thought it was way too easy.|
62839|#824$#If %s2 is too much for you, try swapping out some Masteries. You might find a killer combination!|
62840|#822$#Don't get so down! It's only %s2.
#821$#Before you know it you'll have defeated a hundred of them like it's nothing!|
62841|Do you think I'm getting more skilled?|
62842|It seems like we've been doing the same thing over and over...|
62843|You and I are unstoppable!|
62844|#823$#More skilled? Perhaps. You are definitely learning to use the skills you already have very efficiently.|
62845|#821$#Yeah. We have. It's called %s3.
#822$#We should check out some other dungeons!|
62846|#821$#Dude I know!
#823$#Not even %s2 stood a chance against our collective awesomeness!|
62847|I barely made a dent in %s2!|
62848|Is there something I'm missing when it comes to %s2?|
62849|It's really tough to dodge %s2's special attacks...|
62850|#824$#I'll say! With that puny weapon, it's like attacking a tank with a toothpick!
#821$#Maybe you should pay a visit to the weapon shop.|
62851|#822$#Have you looked to see if %s2 has an elemental type? There might be a weakness you can target...|
62852|#824$#Jack be nimble, Jack be... not dead!|
62853|Do you think I'm getting stronger?|
62854|I've got %s2's moves down cold!|
62855|Anyone can do anything! It just takes practice, right?|
62856|#821$#You know, I had my doubts when I first met you.
#822$#You had potential, but you were soft. Now, you're tough enough that you can even beat %s2!|
62857|#822$#You had better, after fighting a million of them!
#823$#%s2 no challenge anymore. Let's find a new target!|
62858|#821$#I think that's what they tell children in school. But some people are certainly better at things than others.
#823$#Take me, for example. I'm terrible at physics!|
62859|%s2 is always a challenge for me. Am I doing something wrong?|
62860|We should be strong enough to beat %s2, right?|
62861|Is there a better way to take down %s2?|
62862|#821$#Baby steps! If you're having trouble with %s2, then you need to take it slow.
#822$#Get some experience, get some new gear, and then go back to it!|
62863|#821$#We should be, yes, but %s2 can be unpredictable.
#822$#Let's stock up on health potions before picking a fight.|
62864|#822$#Two words: fortification! No, crap, that's just one word...|
62865|Going through %s3 just doesn't feel the same anymore...|
62866|That was the easiest run yet through %s3!|
62867|What are you thinking about?|
62868|#823$#That's because you've gotten stronger! %s3 no longer poses a challenge. We should look for a new dungeon to crawl through!|
62869|#821$#It was a breeze! I almost fell asleep halfway through.
#823$#Let's take on something even tougher than %s3 next time!|
62870|#821$#Ponies!
#822$#No, I don't even really know what I was thinking about. I was spacing out.|
62871|Can you give me any tips on dealing with %s3.|
62872|Is there a way to defeat %s2 faster?|
62873|%s3 stresses me out a bit!|
62874|#821$#Simple: be prepared!
#822$#That means improving your gear and stocking up on health potions before setting foot inside %s3.|
62875|#822$#How did that old story go? The tortoise and the hare, and some guy named Zeno...
#821$#No, I'm getting my stories crossed up. The point is, have patience! Who cares if it takes a long time, so long as you win?|
62876|#821$#Maybe you should focus on something else for a while.
#822$#When you come back to %s3, it'll be a breeze!|
62877|This is getting easier. My skills must be improving!|
62878|What do you think about %s2?|
62879|How would you rate my performance?|
62880|#823$#You get better when you push yourself! Now that %s2 isn't challenging anymore, you should find some tougher enemies.|
62881|#823$#Weak! Pathetic! %s2 isn't even worth the time of day anymore!
#821$#I bet %s2 would keel over if you gave it a stern glare.|
62882|#821$#Super-rad! Yes, that is a technical term.
#823$#No, seriously. The way you took down %s2 was incredible!|
62883|(Yawn) I'm getting sleepy...|
62884|%s2 nearly got the better of us...|
62885|What can we do about %s2?|
62886|#822$#Oh, is it naptime already?|
62887|#822$#Taking a run at %s2 right now might have been ambitious.
#821$#Luckily we got through with our necks intact.|
62888|#821$#If something isn't working, change it up! With skills and Masteries and the Envoy's Path, you have like a billion ways to kit yourself out.|
62889|Do you have any tips for tackling %s3?|
62890|Over already? %s3 was barely a challenge.|
62891|What's the key to victory?|
62892|#822$#I think you're on the right track.
#821$#You might want to give your gear a once-over, maybe fortify some stuff, but I think you'll be fine.|
62893|#821$#True! I hardly broke a sweat.
#823$#We should test our mettle in a tougher dungeon!|
62894|#821$#Confidence! It's amazing what a little self-confidence can do.
#823$#You see how we took down %s2? They must have had no confidence whatsoever.|
62895|What's with all the staring?|
62896|Why does %s2 give me such trouble? No one else seems to have a problem...|
62897|That run through %s3 was tough!|
62898|#821$#Oh, sorry! I was spacing out.
#822$#I was actually reminiscing about that fight with %s2... That was crazy!|
62899|#822$#As I always say... When in doubt, just put your head down and charge forward blindly!
#823$#Ha ha! No, I'm kidding, please don't actually do that.|
62900|#821$#Getting through %s3 was one heck of a task!
#822$#We might want to prepare a bit better if we choose to tackle it again.|
62901|It's pretty easy to take out %s2.|
62902|Is there a place for me in your heart?|
62903|Thinking about beating %s2 gets me all revved up!|
62904|#821$# It was so cool when you defeated %s2.
#823$# That's the kind of think they should adapt into a play!|
62905|#822$# Whenever I look at you,
#823$# I really feel like I joined up with the right person.|
62906|#821$# Let's find ourselves some new opponents.
#824$# I'm totally bored with beating up %s2 all the time.|
62907|Woooooo...I'm feeling a little dizzy...|
62908|Why is this %s2 so obstinate?|
62909|Okay, show me how you'd defeat %s2!|
62910|#822$# What's up? Is there a lingering effect from %s2's attacks?
#821$# Come here and lie down; I'll take a look at you.|
62911|#821$# Did they become stronger, or are you slipping a bit?
#824$# Maybe we need to make sure you're getting a full night's sleep.|
62912|#821$# Fortifying equipment is a nice, direct way to rachet up your power.
#822$# If you invest now, it'll pay handsomely later on the battlefield.|
62913|I'm all too happy to raid %s3 with you.|
62914|It's so easy to conquer %s3.|
62915|Do you like me?|
62916|#823$# I hope you'll always remember how we busted up %s3!|
62917|#821$# You should teach a school course on "How to Raid %s3".
#823$# After all, everyone could use a few pointers.|
62918|#821$# Ever since you beat %s2, 
#823$# I've felt like I made out pretty well, picking you as my partner.|
62919|%s2's power is incredibly strong...|
62920|You seem to be in a bad mood. What's up?|
62921|Why the long face?|
62922|#822$# %s2 from %s3 is really unnerving...
#824$# I can't help but hesitate for a moment when I see them.|
62923|#821$# You should take me out to see the sights sometime, or maybe a night on the town.
#824$# I could use a change of scenery, after looking at %s3 for so long.|
62924|#821$# It's... it's because of me, to leave you trembling with fear in front of %s2...
#824$# I will work harder next time...|
62925|I looked rather dashing when we fought %s2, right?|
62926|The battle with %s2 got me all fired up!|
62927|%s2 is beneath my concern.|
62928|#821$# It feels cheesy saying it, but...
#823$# The way you defeated %s2 was really cool.|
62929|#821$# Not a bad showing!
#823$# When you bested %s2, I was shouting, "Finish them!"|
62930|#822$# Don't pick weak opponents just to look cool.
#821$# Pluck up your courage and fight enemies stronger than %s2!|
62931|Uh-oh, we've got a problem here...|
62932|I've noticed that %s2 isn't always easy to fight.|
62933|I got a real thrill when we battled %s2!|
62934|#821$# Oooof. That wasn't exactly your most graceful fight.
#824$# I almost feel bad for the %s2...|
62935|#824$# If you want to complain, first show your skill.|
62936|#822$# What about the progress from your daily training? Did you know that %s2 was sneering at you?|
62937|It feels fitting to fight alongside you.|
62938|What do you think of %s3?|
62939|%s3 seems too easy for us now!|
62940|#823$# You've made exceptional progress under me.|
62941|#821$# %s3 is a rather lovely place, don't you think?
#823$# Our dungeoneering strategy seems to be working wonders.|
62942|#822$# %s3 is no longer a problem for us.
#821$# Now, let's take on new challenges that cause us some pain!|
62943|Would you care for some guidance on how to improve your attacks?|
62944|How is it that other Eidolons seem to defeat %s2 more easily than me?|
62945|%s3 is giving me a pinch of trouble, admittedly.|
62946|#821$# Pour all of your skill points into DMG. Then, next time we face %s2, pulverize them. 
#822$# Now, don't say I never gave you expert advice!|
62947|#822$# I've explained to you how to conquer %s3. 
#821$# Just check your notes. You ARE writing this down, right?|
62948|#824$# Don't go to %s3 next time. I have tired of watching you struggle to stay alive there.|
62949|Do you think I have the right stuff to be a Guild Master?|
62950|#821$# I've been proud to see %s2 get stronger day by day.
#822$# There's a bright future out there, and with your Guild, you'll definitely find it.|
62951|Do you think I have the right stuff to be a Guild Master?|
62952|#821$# Under your leadership, %s2 has gained more and more renown.
#822$# If you play your cards right, you could take this operation and hit the big time!|
62953|Being a Guild Master really wears me out...|
62954|#821$# Leadership comes with the obligation to aim for the top, for the sake of everyone who relies on you.
#822$# The way will undoubtedly be tough, but I think your leadership will make a difference for %s2.|
62955|Am I qualified to be a Guild Master?|
62956|#821$# Ever since %s2 started following your lead, the atmosphere has become a lot more lively.
#822$# Work together with everyone, and you'll have a happy family you can rely on.|
62957|Do you think I've got the makings of a good Guild Master?|
62958|#821$# You run %s2 quite well.
#822$# If not for your leadership, %s2 might not be the noteworthy Guild that it is.|
62959|Do I make a good Guild Master?|
62960|#823$# Be proud! %s2 has become strong under your astute management.|
62961|Do you think I've got the makings of a great Guild Master?|
62962|#821$# Of course! Everyone looks up to you.
#822$# So, where do I send my application to join %s2?
#823$# Do you sell cookies to fund your raids?|
62963|Am I qualified to be a Guild Master?|
62964|#821$# You're doing as well as can be expected, but...
#823$# Your management style is too lax, I fear. You must consolidate power that none would dare challenge.|
62965|What do you think about the name "%s2?"|
62966|What's your impression of the %s2 Guild?|
62967|#822$# It seems like %s2 is a name that has some kind of special meaning.
#821$# Did you pick this Guild because you like the name?|
62968|#822$# %s2 has a really friendly atmosphere. It seems like a place where you can really grow.|
62969|What do you think about the name "%s2?"|
62970|A-are you crying?|
62971|#821$# Ah, %s2...that guild's name is as a rising star in these lands.
#822$# Are you getting along with your fellow guildmates?|
62972|#822$# P-perish the thought! It's just that, as I've watched you grow in strength with %s2...
#821$# My eyes began to mist up a little.|
62973|I'm trying to get along with everyone in the guild.|
62974|Why are you smiling? Did something good happen?|
62975|#821$# Oh? Did something happen?
#822$# Keep an open channel between you and your fellow guildmates. Communication always helps matters.|
62976|#821$# I just heard some gossip you'll appreciate.
#823$# %s2 is spoken of well in the spirit realm - and spirits are not an easy bunch to please.|
62977|Do you think %s2 is cool?|
62978|What are your impressions of the %s2 Guild?|
62979|#822$# %s2 has a nice atmosphere.
#821$# You've been with %s2 for quite a while - you must feel like you fit in there.|
62980|#822$# You can't expect an accurate assessment from me, as I'm not privy to the guild's daily goings-on.
#821$# But I know that whenever you mention %s2, you're in good spirits. That's a good sign, right?|
62981|I'm boooored. Got any ideas of what to do?|
62982|Maybe I should take up a hobby...|
62983|#822$# Why not try raiding some dungeons with your friends in %s2?
#821$# Friends add color to your life, and that'll keep you from feeling bored.|
62984|#822$# You should get in touch with some of your Guildmates.
#821$# I'm sure they know of some interesting things you could try.|
62985|How do I get along with my guildmates?|
62986|What are your impressions of the %s2 Guild?|
62987|#821$# Have you tried...talking with them? Talking generally helps develop relationships.
#822$# Even Envoys can't read minds, so get out there and get to know others.|
62988|#821$# %s2 is more than simply a guild - it seems to have an element of 'family' about it.
#822$# I believe its other members think likewise.|
62989|Hey, are you upset with me? What did I do?|
62990|You always seem concerned when I talk with my %s2 Guildmates...|
62991|#824$# I feel like lately, you're always chatting with your friends in %s2. When will you make some time for me?|
62992|#824$# I'm always worrying that your guildmates in %s2 will take advantage of your kindness.
#821$# It looks like everything is fine now, but if anyone ever bullies you, you let me know!|
62993|What are your impressions of the %s2 Guild?|
62994|Have you ever talked to anyone from %s2?|
62995|#821$# I must admit, %s2 is not as boring as I expected it to be.
#822$# However, I have yet to determine whether I "like" %s2.|
62996|#823$# The people of %s2 are not bad folk.
#821$# They would make fine soldiers in an army of darkness!|
62997|What's up with our rotten luck lately?|
62998|What's your most prized possession?|
62999|There's some personal stuff going on, and I don't really know who I can talk to about it...|
63000|You've been talkative lately. What's up?|
63001|What should we do today?|
63002|#821$#It seems like %s1 has all the luck! Do they have a better drop rate or something?
#822$#Maybe we should join their party and see if their luck rubs off...|
63003|#821$#Oh, this is going to sound corny, but my most prized 'possessions' are my friends!
#822$#It's one thing to travel around with someone, but it's something else entirely to have someone who understands you.|
63004|#822$#You can talk to your friends! That's why we call them 'friends,' isn't it?
#821$#%s1 seems like the sort who would be there for you when you need it.|
63005|#821$#I've been trying to be more outgoing and talkative. It seems to come so naturally to others...
#822$#Whenever I meet new people, I either clam up entirely or stammer like a lunatic.|
63006|#821$#You've been going at it alone for a while. Maybe today you should call up some friends and team up!|
63007|I always seem to pick up junk that I don't need... Where are all the rare drops?|
63008|Is it lunchtime? What's up with the chopsticks?|
63009|Do you think %s1 is a good friend?|
63010|The weather is pretty crummy today...|
63011|Do you make friends easily?|
63012|#821$#Duh, they're called 'rare drops' for a reason!
#822$#Don't worry so much; you can always hock the stuff you don't need for some extra cash.|
63013|#822$#I was just practicing the secret and forbidden and super-powerful martial art of Chop-Fu!
#821$#No, I'm kidding, I was just hungry.|
63014|#822$#%s1 seems to be loyal and generous. Good qualities to have in a friend!
#821$#But... Oh, this is going to sound rude, but they might need to level up a bit.|
63015|#821$#Well, then let's go indoors! To the dungeons!
#822$#Why don't you invite along %s1?|
63016|#822$#I just speak what's on my mind, but people seem to think that's rude for some reason.|
63017|What's so great about having lots of friends?|
63018|Sometimes I think I should just relax with a good book.|
63019|Slim pickings at the Auction House today...|
63020|I think I'm getting better at diving through dungeons.|
63021|Do you play any sports?|
63022|#823$#Well, the more friends you have...
#821$#The more likely one of them will be online when you need a hand in a tough dungeon!|
63023|#822$#Reading is a great way to spend your spare time.
#821$#And if you're a Sorcerer, you can also toast baddies while you read!|
63024|#821$#Well, not everyone puts their best equipment up for sale.
#823$#Maybe if you do some brown-nosing, your pal %s1 will share some of their top-notch gear!|
63025|#821$#Practice makes perfect, or so they say.
#822$#I noticed that your buddy %s1 was struggling with a dungeon a while back... Maybe you should offer up some tips?|
63026|#823$#Yeah! I was totally playing, um, Roundsportzball the other day...
#822$#And winning! Of course I was winning! Duh!|
63027|I always seem to get lost...|
63028|Are you in a bad mood or something?|
63029|How do I cultivate a sense of humor?|
63030|What's your opinion of %s1?|
63031|I'm famished! Will you make me dinner?|
63032|#821$# If you get lost, go ask %s1.
#823$# Why? They look like they're very good at getting lost, haha.|
63033|#824$#No! Well, maybe... You keep making all sorts of new friends, like %s1...
#822$#How come I don't have any friends? Am I annoying or something?|
63034|#821$#First tip: stop using words like 'cultivate.' There is no humor there whatsoever.
#823$#Once you've excised boring words from your vocabulary... Yeesh! Like 'excise!' What's wrong with me?|
63035|#821$#%s1? They're okay, I guess. I don't have much of an opinion.
#823$#Maybe you should team up for a while so I can psycho-analyze them and give you a full report.|
63036|#821$#What? Why am I the one in charge of making dinner?
#823$#I'm a spiritual being invoked by your connection to Gaia! Why would I know anything about food?|
63037|My Friends List is looking a bit sparse these days...|
63038|How should I allocate these Skill Points?|
63039|Whoa! A letter showed up for you!|
63040|Why doesn't anyone understand me?|
63041|How do I stock up on Loyalty Points?|
63042|#821$#You gotta put yourself out there to meet new people! It can seem scary at times, but it's really not that bad.|
63043|#821$#Maybe you should discuss it with your friends!
#822$#%s1 looks like their Skill Points are pretty well distributed.|
63044|#823$#Look at this! It says I'm the last living relative of a Navean diplomat, making me the sole benefactor of their fortune!
#824$#Dude, I'm gonna be rich! No more instant ramen noodles for me!
#823$#What? You think it's a scam? No way! LAAAAAAME.|
63045|#822$#Awww, chin up!
#821$#You've gotta turn that frown upside-down, y'know? Even %s1 is getting depressed, and they put up with almost anything!|
63046|#821$#Make sure you say 'what up' to your friends when you log in. That'll earn you some Loyalty Points!
#823$#Plus it's a great way to stay in touch with your buddies.|
63047|Do you have many friends?|
63048|Ugh, I keep getting my butt handed to me on the Battlefield...|
63049|You seem pretty sturdy. How can I up my DEF?|
63050|Do you play with dolls?|
63051|How do you sort out an argument?|
63052|#821$#Of course! I'm far more popular than you!
#822$#Like, um... Well, it doesn't really matter who they are, does it?|
63053|#821$#I noticed. And I keep noticing every time it happens.
#822$#Maybe you should team up with someone who complements your skill set. %s1 would be down for a skirmish.|
63054|#823$#Well, my armor is the corporeal manifestation of Gaia's power.
#821$#It's a bit more robust than what you've got on now.
#822$#Maybe it's time to see if the armor shop has anything that'll give you a boost.|
63055|#821$#... Dolls? Where did that come from?
#822$#I'm just going to walk away and pretend you didn't say anything.|
63056|#821$#Unless you lock yourself in the cellar, you're going to come across people you don't always agree with.
#822$#That doesn't make them bad people, though. Just talk to them! Most of the time you can work out your differences.|
63057|Do you think %s1 is a good friend?|
63058|Do you want to make new friends?|
63059|Have you ever lied to me?|
63060|Let's go hit up a dungeon!|
63061|I think I'm getting popular!|
63062|#821$#What do you mean? A good friend to you, or a good friend to me?
#822$#%s1 seems alright, I guess. They're not really my style, but then again I have high standards.|
63063|#821$#Hey! Are you trying to pawn me off on one of your friends?
#824$#That's not cool! Even if %s1 is kinda cute... but that's not the point!|
63064|#824$#No. Nope. Never. Nuh-uh.
#821$#...
#822$#Crap! I can't say it with a straight face!|
63065|#821$#Yeah! Let's go! I'm ready to dive into your dungeon!
#822$#Wait. That came out wrong... Um... Oh nevermind, let's just go.|
63066|#821$#It does seem like you have to scroll your Friends List for a loooong time.
#824$#Just don't ignore me because you're all famous now, okay?|
63067|How do I make more friends?|
63068|I know it seems like I can swim forever with zero effort, but I'm actually really afraid of drowning.|
63069|Are you bored? Let's chat!|
63070|Do you like to sing?|
63071|I look good in this outfit, right?|
63072|#822$#What you need to do is find some really popular people and then stick to them like glue.
#821$#Yeah, just like a remora! Attach your sucker-like jaws to %s1's leg; you'll be popular in no time.|
63073|#821$#Don't worry. If you started to sink, I'd call up %s1 to come save you.
#823$#I would do it myself, but I don't really want to get my outfit wet.|
63074|#824$#Why? You want to talk about nothing again, don't you? Ugh! So needy...
#821$#If you want to have a pointless conversation, go talk to your friend %s1.|
63075|#824$#Of course! I sing all the time! You want me to sing a song for you?
#823$#Hold on, let me get out my glitter microphone... Hey, where are you going?|
63076|#824$#(Sigh) You look, um... unique. Yeaaaah, let's put it like that.
#822$#Take some tips from %s1; they're a pretty sharp dresser!|

63285|What attacks work best in dungeons?|
63286|How can I improve my win rate on the battlefield?|
63287|Lately, my memory's been kinda fuzzy.|
63288|Level with me here - do you think I'm good-looking?|
63289|How does one become a hero?|
63290|Do you think Zeal is a useful Mastery?|
63291|#821$# Try to use Advanced Masteries.
#822$# For example, the %s2 that you learned is a skill with useful applications in dangerous dungeons.|
63292|#821$# Try different Mastery combinations.
#822$# For example, you've learned %s2 - it's a very practical skill in battlefield matches.|
63293|#824$# Are you going amnesiac on me? This isn't the kind of RPG to go with such a hackneyed plot development!|
63294|#821$# Good looking, bad looking...it's all just a surface distinction. What lies in the heart is more important.
#823$# It's the same with masteries - it's not about how you look when you're using them, but how your skill has allowed you to learn them.|
63295|#821$# No matter what kind of person you want to become, you have to start with self-understanding.
#822$# Reaching out to learn more Masteries and Envoy's Path talents are good ways to shape yourself.|
63296|#821$# Zeal can stir up a person's fighting spirit and make one's blood boil in anticipation of action.
#822$# You'll have a chance of increasing your DMG when attacking, and badly weakening the enemy's fighting power.|
63297|What do you know about the Iron Wall Mastery?|
63298|How can I use %s2 most effectively?|
63299|Will mastering %s2 give me some breathing room in a fight?|
63300|It's weird to say, but I'm really proud of how strong you are!|
63301|How can our fights together be more stylish and cool?|
63302|It seems like lately, I've been achieving new Masteries all over the place.|
63303|#821$# Iron Wall is a Mastery than anyone can find a use for.
#822$# After all, if you crumple like a tissue in the rain, what can you really accomplish?|
63304|#821$# %s2 is a shockingly powerful Mastery.
#823$# The best way to use it is without hesistation, striking down all foes before you.|
63305|#821$# I can see that %s2 has been of great help to you with your life of adventure.
#822$# Teach me about it next time we have a free moment. Close partners share their knowledge, right?|
63306|#821$# I'm glad you know strength when you see it!
#823$# When you become as strong as I am, skills like %s2 become superfluous.|
63307|#821$# You ought to lay hold of some Advanced Masteries.
#823$# Advanced Masteries like %s2, with its power and beauty, will mark you as a rising star of the battlefield.|
63308|#822$# You have to continue practicing skills even after you learn them.
#821$# One has to develop intimate familiarity with their skills to truly be called a master.|
63309|I still don't seem able to understand the nuances of %s2...|
63310|When I run up against a difficult foe, how can I face them?|
63311|%s2 is a Mastery I'm really impressed with.|
63312|What strategies should I follow to stay alive in a dungeon?|
63313|At times, I just feel so ordinary, y'know?|
63314|Do you know much about the Focus Mastery? I've been curious about it.|
63315|#823$# Let's drop the pretenses of humility.
#822$# Your fighting abilities have clearly improved since you learned to use %s2.
#821$# Don't let your pace falter; then you'll be able to use it to even greater effect!|
63316|#822$# When you aren't confident of winning, don't rush your opponent head-on in the battle.
#821$# Try to use %s2 to attack enemies in a roundabout way.|
63317|#823$# You seem to like using %s2 a lot.
#822$# Ever since you mastered %s2, I've seen you use it frequently.
#821$# Any special reason for that?|
63318|#821$# Every dungeon has its own unique monster deployment and mechanisms.
#822$# Try to find the combination of Masteries best suited to the task at hand; that'll make your battle easier.|
63319|#823$# %s1, when you mastered %s2, I saw your body flash with a blinding light.
#821$# Could an ordinary person do that? Would an ordinary person make contracts with spirits? I doubt it.|
63320|#821$# Focus allows the user to concentrate intently, turning all the body's power toward one end.
#822$# In a focused state like that, a fighter is capable of greater-than-normal agility and can hit enemies from unbelievable angles.|
63321|Wooo! I'm just too good sometimes!|
63322|What do I do if I get into a conflict with people?|
63323|How can I best tap my latent potential?|
63324|I think my capabilities have really surged since I started learning more Masteries.|
63325|What happened? Why do you keep shaking your head at me?|
63326|What kind of Mastery do you think Murderous Intent is?|
63327|#822$# It must be because you've mastered %s2.
#821$# Perhaps you've leveraged its strong offensive to become bolder in battle!|
63328|#823$# It's simple. Just use %s2 to bash your opponent so hard that they'll be picking their teeth up off the ground.
#821$# Hahaha, just kidding. Don't go around making unnecessary enemies. The ones you have will be trouble enough.|
63329|#821$# Haven't you mastered %s2, %s1?
#822$# Just follow the impluse %s2 gives you to grow as a fighter.|
63330|#822$# You may use Masteries, but I am a master. How can a skill compare to the assistance I provide?|
63331|#824$# Even though you've mastered %s2, I don't see you using it much.
#821$# If you don't put to use what you've learned, what good is it?|
63332|#822$# Murderous Intent will, of course, increase the flames of fury within you; just aim at the vulnerability of your enemies and attack.
#821$# If you come across opponents you must defeat quickly, put this Mastery to use.|
63333|How do I get a high score on the battlefield?|
63334|What should I do when I'm surrounded by enemies?|
63335|How do I gain the upper hand in battle?|
63336|Have you heard any interesting rumors?|
63337|What do you know about the Divine Power Mastery?|
63338|Creating a personalized combat style is harder than it looks...|
63339|#821$# You can gain the upper hand on the battlefield by utilizing your powerful Masteries.
#822$# You should use %s2 to gradually stack up damage - that'll increase your score.|
63340|#822$# %s2 is a very good skill to use when you're surrounded by enemies.
#821$# Massive destructive power tends to clear an area pretty quickly.|
63341|#822$# As long as you keep one step ahead of your enemy, you'll be able to gain the upper hand in combat.
#821$# Use %s2 more often, %s1; it will help you leverage your natural advantage.|
63342|#823$# You know, it's said that the %s2 Mastery wasn't originally developed for battle.
#821$# The hero who created %s2 apparently invented it mainly to win in competitions.
#822$# Now I'm curious what kind of competition it was...|
63343|#821$# Legends say that ancient heroes who made use of Divine Power were unrivaled in battle.
#822$# They could deal traumatic damage that their enemies seldom recovered from.|
63344|#821$# Mmm... It definitely isn't easy creating a unique combat style...
#822$# Try out different Masteries. Eventually you'll find a combo that just clicks for you.|
63345|Welp, I got owned by that dungeon again.|
63346|What should I do if a battle turns desperate?|
63347|Let's join some battlefield matches later.|
63348|Have you been learning a new Mastery in secret?|
63349|I've picked up a few new Masteries lately, and I'm feelin' proud of myself!|
63350|What do you know about the Break Defense Mastery?|
63351|#824$# Well, you can't say I've held back in giving you tips and tricks.
#821$# Next time, use destructive Masteries to blow them out of the water.
#822$# As long as your strength is far greater than that of your enemies, you'll emerge victorious.|
63352|#822$# When retreat isn't an option, you have to fight your way out!
#821$# If you have a powerful Mastery like %s2, it can save your life at a crucial moment!|
63353|#822$# Maybe we ought to swap notes.
#821$# Remember to use %s2 later - utilize your strength to the fullest!|
63354|#822$# I don't need to learn human Masteries.
#821$# Flailing my arms around would be enough to beat most mortals.|
63355|#821$# You need to fully understand your Masteries. Don't underestimate such potent abilities.|
63356|#822$# When you come across enemies that are very resilient, use the Break Defense Mastery to your advantage.
#823$# The more damage that goes through, the faster the fight will end.|
63357|What happened? Why are you sighing?|
63358|If I'm defeated one day...|
63359|How do I learn an Advanced Mastery?|
63360|What are you doing with that Mastery book for %s2?|
63361|Let's go take a walk in the forest, shall we?|
63362|What kind of Mastery is Vigor?|
63363|#824$# Well, you've become much stronger after learning %s2...
#824$# What if you attract the attention of other Eidolons?|
63364|#821$# You're joking, right?
#822$# As long as you master %s2, no one should be able to strike you down.|
63365|#822$# Some powerful enemies carry Advanced Mastery Books with them.
#821$# If you want to, we can go challenge them!|
63366|#822$# W-wait, it's not what it looks like!
#821$# Maybe we should talk about some of the things YOU read when you think no one is looking¡K|
63367|#822$# That sounds good. It's been a while since we took a walk together.
#821$# You've been polishing your skills so much lately that we haven't had much time to talk.|
63368|#822$# Vigor can energize a person, allowing them to withstand more attacks.
#821$# If you use this Mastery, you'll be able to slug it out with fewer worries!|
63369|How can I become rich?|
63370|I want to leave my mark on the battlefield.|
63371|Is it just me, or have I been kind of a genius lately?|
63372|Whoa! Why'd you suddenly hit me?|
63373|They say that enough practice can smooth out one's flaws.|
63374|Have you ever heard of a Mastery called Organized Sabotage?|
63375|#823$# Ah, the inevitable tug of lucre!
#821$# If you defeat strong enemies while using %s2, you'll be swimming in cash in no time, %s1.|
63376|#824$# You think you're ready for the battlefield with skills like THAT? Learn more Masteries, then we'll see.|
63377|#821$# Hmm... After you learned %s2, your performance did improve.
#824$# I wonder if there's any connection¡K|
63378|#824$# Have you heard of the %s2 Mastery?
#821$# If you'd studied it, you could have dodged that attack easily.|
63379|#822$# You do put forth considerable effort.
#821$# I was surprised that you were able to learn %s2; maybe you're more flexible than I took you for.
#823$# I hope your mind is always open to learning.|
63380|#821$# Organized Sabotage can effectively decrease enemies' offensive power.
#822$# Use this Mastery properly in battle to weaken foes, making them easier to contend with.|
63381|You know, about those potions...|
63382|Sometimes, I'm confused by everything going on in battle...|
63383|What do you think about food?|
63384|What kind of living conditions do you prefer?|
63385|How do I become attractive to the opposite sex?|
63386|I just had a sudden craving for %s2...|
63387|#821$# A small bottle of potion can gradually heal even severe bodily injury
#822$# %s2 is particularly effective; well worth the money.|
63388|#822$# In battle, if you use %s2 in advance, you won't lose your control, even when things get hectic.|
63389|#821$# Delicious food is one of the fringe benefits of travel.
#822$# You can't say your life is well-lived unless you take time to savor your meals.|
63390|#821$# A clean environment and friendly neightbors are important!
#823$# It would be great if there were shops nearby that sold gourmet food like %s2.|
63391|#821$# You must first realize your own value to become attractive to others.
#822$# Try learning to cook! Everyone loves a talented chef, and they're often invited to parties.|
63392|#821$# It looks like we're thinking on the same wavelength!
#823$# Actually, I'd just like to have some %s2!|
63393|Relying on potions to outlast enemies seems kiiiinda cheap...|
63394|You know, about those health potions...|
63395|Why are you coughing all the time?|
63396|What do you think about food?|
63397|I don't have any strength anymore...|
63398|How do you have so much stamina all the time?|
63399|#823$# Haha, don't be shy. Using potions well is its own kind of tactic.|
63400|#821$# I've actually never tried a %s2. Do I really need to?|
63401|#821$# Uh...well... I was eating too fast...
#824$# Can't believe I almost died from a %s2...|
63402|#821$# The martial arts and cooking are both fine skills worth cultivating.
#823$# You never know when you'll be a contestant on "Mithril Chef"!|
63403|#822$# Are you hungry?
#821$# Let's get some food in you. I know %s2 is your favorite.|
63404|#823$# It's because I have a good regimen.
#821$# A human must exercise, and eat heartily of %s2.
#822$# For humans, good food is fuel for all your deeds and actions.|
63405|Looks like I finally have to sort out my inventory...|
63406|Say, about those potions...|
63407|I'm in a good mood today. Let's make a big meal!|
63408|How can I become a super awesome cook?|
63409|What's it like in the realm of spirits?|
63410|A friend's birthday is coming up, but I don't know what to get them.|
63411|#821$# Well, whatever you clean out, be sure you keep some potions on you.
#822$# It'd be embarassing to die to an injury that a simple potion could've cured.|
63412|#822$# Potions restore your HP gradually, so don't wait until you're at critical health to use them.|
63413|#823$# Oh? What's with the sudden interest?
#822$# Might I suggest %s2?
#821$# Fine food can elevate a good day to a great day.|
63414|#823$# Oh, but we must prepare for it first.
#821$# It is very important for becoming a professional chef to collect fresh materials.|
63415|#822$# It is a vast realm, far wider than a world.
#821$# It would be interesting to see your reaction, if you were to go there.|
63416|#823$# It really depends on the relationship you have with your friend.
#821$# The best gifts often relate to the connection between giver and receiver.|
63417|How do I deal with enemies stronger than me?|
63418|You know those potions I've got, right?|
63419|What do you want most right now?|
63420|Did you have a nightmare last night?|
63421|Heard any interesting rumors about %s2?|
63422|What do you think about cooking?|
63423|#821$# If you face a strong enemy, draw out the fight a bit.
#823$# If your healing and potions can cover the damage you take from a foe, you can win even against a stronger opponent.|
63424|#821$# I know all about %s2 - do you? It would be shameful to be defeated knowing you could have just used that to recover.|
63425|#821$# To be on the winning side of battle, of course.
#822$# You won't let me down, will you %s1?|
63426|#824$# It was an unpleasant dream.
#821$# Emptiness was encroaching all around; an insatiable nothingness.
#822$# I woke up just before all hope had been lost...|
63427|#821$# I've heard that two old kingdoms once fought over the recipe for %s2.
#824$# How many lives were lost in such a vain pursuit?
#822$# What mere meal could be worth the price of a life?|
63428|#821$# Cooking is a wonderful kind of magic you humans possess.
#824$# And just like magic, if you're really awful, you can hurt someone with it!|
63429|So, about those potions...|
63430|Potions are so expensive! I feel like I have to take out a loan to keep myself stocked up.|
63431|%s2 tastes so good!|
63432|I feel like I've lost my appetite lately.|
63433|How can I become better at something I'm not that good at?|
63434|What do you think about humans?|
63435|#821$# If you don't have any %s2 with you, you can at least sit down and rest to recover before moving onward.|
63436|#821$# Allies can support you in battle. The more you rely on them, the more money it saves you on potions.
#822$# It seems all would benefit from that arrangement.|
63437|#823$# If you follow the recipe, chances are, you'll arrive at a tasty dish.
#822$# But beware of deviating if you don't know what you're doing.
#821$# On the other hand, humans seem to love experimentation...|
63438|#821$# Perhaps you ought to eat some %s2.
#822$# I've heard that its taste will appeal to most any palate.|
63439|#823$# Well, practice makes perfect, as the saying goes.
#822$# But you have to keep in mind, sloppy practice will not help you improve.
#821$# Only perfect practice makes perfect. Take it at your own pace to make sure you learn.|
63440|#821$# The history of human civilization is fascinating. It seems the conflicts never cease...
#822$# But long histories also contribute to the richness of a culture.|
63441|I've felt kinda lonely lately...|
63442|Hey, about those health potions...|
63443|I'm really craving the taste of %s2.|
63444|Have you developed any new interests lately?|
63445|What do you think of Port Skandia?|
63446|There's a nice, clear sky today!|
63447|The strong often walk alone. Others do not understand what it is to be them, or to bear the burdens that often accompany strength.|
63448|#823$# Remember to buy potions while you're in town. You don't want to be in a dungeon and suddenly run out.|
63449|#822$# Hmm... Does %s2 really taste that good?
#821$# I didn't expect you to have the mountain-man appetite to eat it.|
63450|#821$# I find your world's "theatre" quite fascinating.
#822$# Sometimes, I remember the incidents on which the old tales portrayed are based.|
63451|#824$# Skandia is a rather backwater town, isn't it?
#821$# It's surprising someone as competent as you was raised there!|
63452|#821$# If you look up, there's a cloud that looks sort of like...
#822$# Well...it's kind of indecent; forget I mentioned it.|
63453|Hey, about those health potions...|
63454|I'm not a fan of how potions taste.|
63455|Hey, how would you feel about going on a picnic sometime?|
63456|How do you think I've been doing lately?|
63457|All this fighting has really worked up my appetite!|
63458|Do Eidolons ever sleep?|
63459|#823$# Have you tried %s2? I saw some other warriors using it, and it really brought them back from the brink!|
63460|#821$# It's said that the more bitter the medicine, the more effective it is.
#822$# What were you expecting it to taste like? Cocktails?|
63461|#823$# It sounds like a grand idea, %s1. Be sure to choose a good place.|
63462|#822$# Your fighting form has been good, but...
#823$# It wouldn't kill you to work with others a bit more, you know.|
63463|#821$# Seriously? Last time you practically inhaled your %s2.
#822$# Gluttony might be a virtue in Pandemonium, but not here.|
63464|#822$# We do. It's different from your sleep, though.
#821$# We don't really need beds. But on the other hand, we don't have comfortable pajamas like you.|
63465|You know those health potions?|
63466|What's the best way to use potions?|
63467|What do you think of cooking?|
63468|You seem like you're in a good mood. Should I be worried?|
63469|Why don't I ever see you eat anything?|
63470|When you connect to Gaia, do you ever get anything really weird?|
63471|#821$# I suppose for one like you, a crutch like potions is a necessity. Let's wean you off them, shall we?|
63472|#821$# It's a little-known fact that potion imbibed through the nostrils is absorbed faster by the body.
#824$# Wait, don't actually try it!|
63473|#821$# Cooking is a mundane chore, best left to servants.
#824$# I'm not sure what you find so fascinating about it.|
63474|#823$# Oh, it's quite delightful! I just received an invitation to a grand ball in Pandemonium.
#822$# What do you say? Care to be my consort in hell?|
63475|#822$# Your human food is...less than appealing.
#1020$# It needs to be more exotic. More raw.|
63476|#822$# From time to time,  yes.
#824$# One week, I received a diamond spork. Gaia's will is as capricious as it is mysterious.|

65001|#821$#Hey, it looks like there's a town near here.
#822$#Is it Helonia? I think it is! Let's check it out!|
65002|#822$#It smells delicious over here! Look at all the tasty fruit growing on all these trees... You think Bella will mind if I eat one?|
65003|#824$#Whoa, hold up! This place is swarming with pirates.
#821$#No wonder the townsfolk stay away. You'd better keep on your toes around here!|
65004|#821$#Hey, see those boats out there? Think they're with the Catseye pirates?
#822$#Where? Way out there in the water! Those dinghies going back and forth!
#824$#Oh, I guess you can't see it without the majestic vision of an Eidolon! Nyah!|
65005|#821$#Hm? No, it's nothing... Just... You don't want to end up like that kid Brian, right?
#824$#Well, I don't want you to end up like that either. If that means we must go our separate ways, so be it.|
65006|#822$#Whoa! Is that the Queen Arachnid that they call the Shadow of Helonia?
#821$#She's huuuuuuge! I hope you brought plenty of health potions!
#824$#I mean... I'm not trying to say that I don't think you can win. Just that it's good to be prepared.|
65007|#821$#I love talking a stroll through flower fields.
#821$#Something about the scent... lifts away all... of your worries... zzzzz...|
65008|#822$#Gnomes, huh. They're not the smartest bunch, so they make up for it by being overly aggressive.
#821$#Keep on your toes. They won't let us just strut into their camp like we own the place.|
65009|#821$#Did you see that? Rosie was totally checking me out!|
65010|#822$#Can you feel that? There's a weird energy in the air.
#822$#I wonder what's locked up in that temple over there?|
65011|#821$#That Templar has given us some curiously specific tasks.
#821$#Do you think she's come across other Envoys?|
65012|#821$#I heard that Lunarin's border used to stretch all the way out here.
#824$#Now it's just a breeding ground for ugly bugs! Ugly buglies!|
65013|#822$#Navea! This is the biggest human city, right?
#822$#Let's explore! Whoa, lookit that floating thing! Oh, and there are the shops!|
65014|#821$#Hey, look up there! It's the Cube of Gaia!
#821$#Ha ha, no, it's just a replica. But it's still pretty cool, isn't it?|
65015|#824$#Hm. The Military Zone. Lots of serious business going on here.
#821$#Look at them all standing in rows as that guy barks out orders! It's so regimented, I don't think I'd last a day...|
65016|#821$#Um, so, fair warning... You might want to give those Waterlight Mushrooms to Montero as soon as possible.
#824$#Beebis is staring at them and drooling. He looks pretty hungry.|
65017|#824$#This is it? This is the disguise?
#821$#I hope that Vhell is really, really dumb, 'cause this isn't gonna work if he's got half a brain.|
65018|#821$#You look ridiculous.|
65019|#821$#Huh. You can barely tell there's a human underneath all those twigs.
#821$#Just remember to take it off once we're done with this. You'll scare the children if you go back to town like that.
#824$#Wait... Do Dwarves even have children? Or do they just... always look like that?|
65020|#823$#Ha ha! Ha! Oh geez... sorry... ha hahah... ha...
#821$#No, I'm not laughing AT you, I'm... just... Okay, I'm lying, I am laughing at you.|
65021|#824$#Oh, wow! That Woodbeast Disguise is really, um, interesting.
#821$#No, no! It doesn't look bad... It's just, I don't know, I think maybe it just isn't your color.|
65022|#824$#Do you really think this is going to work?|
65023|#824$#That's a really good look for you.
#821$#...
#823$#Dangit! I can't keep a straight face!|
65024|#824$#Hm? Where did you go? All I see now is a weird monster.
#821$#Oh well, I suppose I'll just have to destroy it like all the other ones.|
65025|#824$#Aaaah! Ants ants ants ants ants ants ants ants...
#821$#Beebis! That dopey ostrich kicked over an ant nest! Oh, gross, they're everywhere!|
65026|#821$#Once we do a quick patrol, we can join the ROBOT FIGHTING COMPETITION!
#822$#I really think it should be capitalized, don't you? It gives it some, I dunno, some more oomph.|
65027|#821$#Those poor Butterfly Fairies... They're only aggressive because their water source has been contaminated.|
65028|#824$#It's weird. Caroline hates her Eidolon, yet it still sticks around.
#821$#You don't hate me like that, do you? We're, um... We're, like, a team, yeah?|
65029|#821$#All right! You're getting stronger!
#822$#I need to beef up as well.|
65030|#821$#Do you know about Masteries? They can really add some oomph to your lineup of skills.
#821$#You should do some research - they'll be a great aid in battle!|
65031|#821$#Yeah! Level up!
#821$#How's your gear doing? It might be time to see if you can equip some new stuff!|
65032|#821$#Level level level! And it even comes with a point for the Envoy's Path!
#822$#Whatcha gonna spend it on? Might I suggest Greediness? That'll help you find more XP Crystals to give me!|
65033|#822$#Dude! You just keep leveling up and up and up...
#821$#Now that you've hit 20, maybe you should start up a guild.|
65034|#823$#That level got you another point for the Envoy's Path!
#824$#I'm not trying to be "greedy," but you should put that point into Greediness!|
65035|#824$#You just keep raking in the levels... I can barely keep up!|
65036|#821$#Have I told you that I'm plugged into the All-Eidolon Radio?
#822$#Well, not really. I just can hear their voices sometimes... It sounds like they're impressed by how strong you've gotten!|
65037|#823$#Hey there leveler, you ever think about using your newfound beefiness to help others?
#821$#It might be time to head over to Mirabelle's Bulletin Board to see if anyone needs a hand!|
65038|#821$#Hey rockstar, you're now part of the 27 Club!
#821$#What? You mean the 27 Club isn't just for people who are level 27? Oh...|
65039|#823$#Another day, another level!
#821$#Another opportunity to show just awesome we are!|
65040|#823$#Level 30! Now we can get into Cactakara Forest!
#822$#We should chat with some of the Dwarves there... They know everything there is to know about machines.|
65041|#821$#Bigger, tougher, stronger, level-upper!
#822$#Let's go take on some elite baddies!|
65042|#821$#Keep shootin' for the stars! That's the way to succeed.
#821$#Huh? I learned that by watching you!|
65043|#821$#Yes! Another hard-earned level!
#824$#Bow-chikka-bow-wow!|
65044|#823$#Congrats! 38 is my favorite number for reasons I can't quite explain...
#824$#I wonder... When is Beebis going to start leveling up?|
65045|#821$#All-Eidolon Radio is buzzing again!
#821$#Some other Eidolons have been talking you up. I wouldn't be surprised if they try and get ahold of you soon.|
65046|#821$#YES! Level 40 is where all kinds of awesome stuff happens!
#822$#Survival Mode, Secondary Weapons, General Awesomeness!|
65047|#821$#How are you liking your secondary weapon?
#823$#You've picked it up really quickly... You must be a natural!|
65048|#822$#High Five! Why? Because you just leveled up!
#824$#And your new level is divisible by three, which means you get an Envoy's Path point!
#823$#Didja know? You can tell if a number is divisible by three by seeing if the sum of its digits is also divisible by three. Try it!|
65049|#823$#Groovy! You just learned a new skill for your backup weapon. Let's go try it out!|
65050|#821$#It always makes me happy to see you improve.
#822$#Oh, geez, now you're even tougher than me! I gotta go hit the gym!|
65051|#823$#LEVEL UUUPPPPPP! Wahoo!
#822$#What? So I got a little excited...|
65052|#821$#Ah yes, you have another Mastery available! Why can't you equip all of them at once?
#824$#Maybe I'm just greedy, but I'd want to stack them all on and just go berserk.|
65053|#823$#You've been levelized to 48! Now you can get even better gear from the shops!
#821$#Or are you too cool for store-bought gear these days?|
65054|#824$#All that hard work has paid off! You've been leveling up like mad!
#821$#But, ya know... It's also not a bad idea to take a break once in a while.|
65055|#821$#Fifty? FIFTY! Now things are really starting to open up!
#824$#We should pay a visit to the Grand Bishop... I'm sure he needs plenty of help.|
65056|#822$#Oh, don't mind me. I just get a little choked up when I see how far you've come!
#821$#It seems like just the other day you were barely in single digits, and now look at you!|
65057|#821$#Tons of levels and adventures. We've been through a lot together!
#823$#I don't think there's anyone else who could have accomplished what we have, do you?|
65058|#821$#That's another skill for your secondary weapon!
#822$#I think you've got a good combination going.|
65059|#821$#Have you chatted with the townspeople about the kidnapping?
#822$#Just call it a hunch, but I think that girl Bonita isn't telling us everything...|
65060|#824$#Huh. I wonder why there are so many Slimelings around here.
#821$#It seems like a strange place for them. Did they wander over from Demarech Pool?|
65061|#821$#Can you feel it? This whole place is buzzing with Gaia's energy!
#821$#But these designs aren't anything you'd find in Navea; it seems like there are groups other than the Church that believe in Gaia.|
65062|#822$#Is this the source of the weird energy in the air?
#821$#It seems like it's causing the nearby creatures to behave strangely.|
65063|#821$#Harvey used to be the Templars' top blacksmith, like Analisa is now.
#822$#I wonder why he retired...|
65064|#823$#A weapon forged from Miracle Crystal? Neat!|
65065|#821$#Looks like the sitch in the Hunter's Village is getting complicated.
#824$#No one can agree on what to do! What do you say we go give them a hand?|
65066|#824$#G-g-g-ghosts? What? No, I'm not scared! Not at all!
#822$#It's just... kinda weird, that's all. Maybe a bit creepy. We should be careful.|
65067|#822$#Hello? Is anyone else getting a sketchy vibe from this Maya girl?
#824$#I know... She's the only one who can disable the barrier, so we have to go along with her. I just don't trust her.|
65068|#824$#So, the barrier keeping us out of Deep's Cavern is gone now? Really?
#821$#Let's check it out. I wonder if Maya actually kept her end of the bargain.|
65069|#821$#This must be the spot where Lucas was found...
#821$#Let's take a look around and see if we can find any evidence.|
65070|#822$#I wonder why Mia wants us to bring back the Totem. Won't it be useless after we bust it up?
#821$#What, aren't you at all curious?|
65071|#821$#So Will was a spy all along? What would cause him to do such a thing?
#822$#What could the Corpsers have possibly offered him?|
65072|#821$#Will was really a Corpser spy? That's awful!
#824$#Well, looks like he will be getting what he deserves. Anya won't cut him any slack.|
65073|#821$#This is where the research team has set up shop, right?
#821$#The Church has a Scholar somewhere around here that we're supposed to meet up with...|
65074|#822$#This spring seems lively, like there's more to it than just water.
#821$#I wonder if this is due to the influence of the Cube of Gaia.|
65075|#822$#Ugh! How rude! Is it really too much for them to listen for just a few minutes?
#821$#Do we really want to form an alliance with those arrogant cats?|
65076|#824$#Who do the Makar think they are? Oooh, I'm riled up!
#821$#Let's go find some monsters to beat up on; I need to work off this anger!|
65077|#821$#Oh... This Makar is gravely wounded. I don't know how much we can do for him, but we at least have to try!|
65078|#821$#Woo! Beebis can really stretch his legs in these open plains!
#824$#Just don't let him become lunch for the beasts around here.|
65079|#822$#Lookin in this Makar's eyes; the pain he feels isn't normal. This is no everyday poison. 
#821$#I suspect something more foul, like a curse. Perhaps the Gnomes and their cruel tricks are to blame.|
65080|#823$#Isn't it funny? Not too long ago, you and Para were rivals in the arena.
#821$#Now the two of you are banding together to solve the mysteries in the Wrathborne Temple!|
65081|#821$#Whoa! Hey! Slow down! STOP!
#824$#You didn't even notice that gigantic spider dangling right above your head, did you? Geez, you can be so thick sometimes...|
65082|#821$#Zachary complains a lot about taking care of all the children.
#822$#But did you notice that he was smiling? I don't think he actually minds it all that much.|
65083|#824$#Would you look at this dreary place? It's hard to believe the Oblitus Wood was once known for it's lush greenery.
#822$#Even Beebis won't touch the plants here! And we're talking about an ostrich that once ate your shoe...|
65084|#824$#Everything here seems dead, and I'm not just talking about all the zombies!
#821$#Something is definitely wrong in this forest. Are the Dwarves really to blame for all this?|
65085|#821$#Remember what Camilla said; the Sand Owl Bandits poison their weapons.
#822$#We should keep on our toes out there.|
65086|#824$#Seriously? We get to scout the camp on our own while the mercenaries hang around doing nothing?
#822$#How is it we always get roped into doing all the work?|
65087|#822$#Caroline! Who would have thought that she was the one behind all of this?|
65088|#821$#Wh-what's that? Is that an earthquake?
#824$#No, it's something else. Something below the sands is stirring, like it's just waking up after a long sleep.|
65089|#821$#Were these monsters really once human? That's awful!
#821$#I wonder... Are we doing them a favor by destroying them?|
65090|#821$#Once every now and then we come across an Envoy who is brave enough to take on Survival Mode!
#822$#One slipup in that mode and you're done for, kaput, finito!|
65091|#822$#  There's just no reasoning with the Avian Patrol. They attack us without warning. Perhaps they're under some sort of spell... You must proceed with caution!|

53643|#825$# Actually, Diao Chan really likes to read books and play chess.
#821$#Not to brag, but no one has ever beaten her at chess!|
53644|#822$#Don't just ask about Diao Chan the whole time - tell me about master's hobbies, too!
#821$#Do master and Diao Chan have any hobbies in common?|
53645|#821$#Diao Chan usually reads books and plays chess with Vayu. Diao Chan always wins!
#822$#Vayu said that Diao Chan is a very talented strategist. Does master agree?|
53646|#822$#Diao Chan likes drinking tea and chatting with friends.
#823$#Oh! Will master accompany Diao Chan to the next tea party?
#821$#Diao Chan hasn't heard about Shirayuki's hometown...|
53651|Tell me about the city of Navea.|
53652|What do you think of Navea?|
53653|#821$#Diao Chan has heard Navea is an important city in Midgard. Is that true?
#822$#The Sky Tower is located there; it contains ancient treasures from all over the world!|
53654|#821$#It's a beautiful place where adventurers from all walks of life gather.
#822$#Diao Chan would like to visit as soon as her work here is done. Won't that be great?|
53655|#821$#The place is a cultural melting pot with a long, rich history. It sounds wonderful!  
#822$#It's completely normal to see Makar and dwarves in Navea.|
53656|#822$#There's also supposed to be a shop in the city that sells delicious snacks! Diao Chan wonders if it's true...|
53661|What do dwarves look like?|
53662|I'd like to know more about the dwarven race.|
53663|#821$#The dwarves are known for being masters of robotics and crafting.
#822$#Their robots help them complete tasks which would require them to be a bit... taller.
#823$# The dwarves are a powerful race, indeed!|
53664|#821$#There is supposed to be a dwarf tribe living in the Cactakara Forest. Do you think we could go visit them?|
53665|#822$# To be honest, sometimes Diao Chan can't tell the difference between dwarves and goblins.|
53666|#821$#The dwarves seem to always hide their faces behind veils... Why do they do that?
#822$#Diao Chan wants to see their faces!|
53671|Can you tell me about Silent Ice Field?|
53672|What's the Silent Ice Field like?|
53673|#821$#It's a very, very cold place - it has a deep sense of sorrow that penetrates to your core.|
53674|#821$#It's a land of eternal winter. Doesn't Shirayuki's hometown have similar weather patterns?|
53675|#822$#The monsters there are very strong. It would be dangerous to go without a guide!|
53676|#821$#A place completely consumed by snow and silence...
#822$#It's kind of romantic, doesn't master agree?|
53681|How should I choose my path on the Envoy's Path?|
53682|What is the Envoy's Path?|
53683|#821$#The Envoy's Path allows you to acquire new combat techniques...
#822$#It seems like master hasn't yet decided on a path to take.
#823$#It's makes Diao Chan a little nervous, but Diao Chan will support whatever decision master makes.|
53684|#823$#If master likes treasure, why not try walking down the Path of Greed?|
53685|#821$#Skills that master uses often are the best candidates for the upgrade path.
#823$#Master thinks every skill should be improved to the highest level...|
53686|#821$#It's important that you choose the path that fits you best.
#822$#Don't let others influence master's decision!|
53691|I want to know about skill mastery!|
53692|Could you tell me more about skill mastery?|
53693|#823$# Master's drive to improve is impressive!
#822$#Let's take a little breather before we head to the the Emerald Marsh.
#821$#We'll discuss skill mastery next time. Sound all right?|
53694|#821$#Skill mastery? That's the way to go about perfecting master's current skills.  
#822$#Master is already so powerful, even without having maxed everything out...
#823$# Diao Chan bets master would be the best in the world if that were the case!|
53695|#821$#If master has tokens, maser can buy skill masteries in Navea.
#822$#Master is the best - Diao Chan doesn't even care about unmastered skills!|
53696|#824$#Ouch! There's sand in Diao Chan'S eyes...|
53701|Where are you from?|
53702|Can you tell me about your hometown?|
53703|#821$#Diao Chan comes from an eastern land. Our culture is completely different from the one here.
#822$#Diao Chan misses her home, but master is more than worth staying here for!|
53704|#821$#It's been so long since she's been home, she doesn't think she can quite picture what it looks like.|
53705|#822$#Enough about Diao Chan -  talk more about master!|
53706|#821$#Diao Chan comes from a far-off eastern land.
#822$#She thinks master would like her hometown...|
53711|Do you know those two guys over there?|
53712|The ones who tried to talk to you?|
53713|#824$#They're only interested in Diao Chan's looks.|
53714|#823$# Master is so wise...
#822$#Diao Chan has no particular relationship with them. Does master have a special relationship?|
53715|#821$#Master shouldn't be fooled by beauty.
#822$#That said, does the master still trust Diao Chan?|
53716|#825$#Master should not bring up ancient history...|
53721|You use a fan as a weapon?|
53722|Could you tell me more about your weapon?|
53723|#821$#This fan is has an ancient power within it.
#822$#Diao Chan loves it and takes it everywhere she goes.|
53724|#821$#When she wields it, she can summon the wind to attack the enemy.
#823$# Master should let Diao Chan do the dirty work!|
53725|#821$#Using a fan as a weapon is rare where Diao Chan comes from.
#822$#Really, it's not that hard to summon the wind. You just have to know how to handle a fan!|
53726|#823$#Haha! Let me fan you a bit.|
53731|Your clothes are very unique.|
53732|They look very good on you!|
53733|#823$#Ah! You do have a way with words, Master!
#821$#I have to dress up because I am coming with you on your journey! Does that make you happy?|
53734|#821$#But... isn't this style a bit too foreign for me?|
53735|#824$#Now, now... don't just look at Diao Chan's clothes!
#822$#Try to focus on Diao Chan's inner beauty! That is where her genuine beauty comes from.|
53736|#823$#Oh, really? It makes me happy that you like it! To think... Astraea tried to tell me that my skirt was too short.|
53741|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
53742|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolons.|
53743|#822$#Cesela and Serena look just alike. Some say that they are twins,
#821$#but they've never confirmed it.
#823$# Why not let me find out? I might be able to get some answers!|
53744|#821$#Alucard always speaks in the most refined tone... Even when he's talking to me.
#822$#Goodness, finding a man who can stay this calm when talking to me is... quite rare!
#823$#Hey! Doesn't look directly in my eyes like Bealdor does! Tee hee! |
53745|#821$#Cleopawtra is certainly a deadly character...
#823$#And while you mention it... I bet her relationship with Tigerius Caesar is quite exciting, too!
#822$#Master must be careful! Don't get taken in by her charm... You already have me, you know.|
53746|#821$#Cyril is a very positive person... but somehow I always feel a bit tense when dealing with him.
#822$#I think I would prefer someone less positive and more relaxed!|
53751|Do you have any wishes?|
53752|Will you make a wish if I let you?|
53753|#821$#Wishes... I think mine has already come true!
#822$#Because I've found someone that I can rely on... Haven't I?|
53754|#825$#Please don't laugh at my answer, Master...
#822$#I wish for peace and prosperity everywhere in the world! No more war...|
53755|#821$#I wish... I wish to be with you forever!
#822$#To be in your service forever - that is Diao Chan's dream...|
53756|#821$#This question... Does it mean that Master wants to help my dreams come true?|
53761|Tell me a story.|
53762|Do you think I should tell a story?|
53763|#821$#A long time ago, miracle child was born in a small fishing port. He was granted a mysterious power...
#822$#As fate would have it, he went on a long journey, where he witnessed a great many things...
#823$#And then... he met the woman of his dreams. And that... is Diao Chan.|
53764|#821$#Yes... A long time ago, there was a region that was ravaged by wars. Every single country wanted to be ruler of the region.
#822$#And there was one... one incredibly evil power who had made only enemies for himself.
#821$#But a lady came along and used her beauty to drive a wedge between him and his general.
#825$#Master, do you know why she would have done that?|
53765|#823$#Haha... Master is like a child at times...
#821$#But what type of story does Master like to hear?|
53766|#823$#Ah! Aren't all of Master's experiences legendary tales in their own right?
#821$#How about it? Let me help Master collect these stories and make them into a memoir. What do you think?
#822$#Don't underestimate Diao Chan. She's an awfully good writer... and her penmanship is excellent!|
53771|Do you know Kotonoha?|
53772|How is Kotonoha related to you?|
53773|#822$#Why do you ask?
#821$#Diao Chan is not related to that fox!|
53774|#821$#Does my question... make you think of anything in particular?
#823$Ha! Looking at Master's facial expression, Diao Chan seems to have hit the nail on the head!|
53775|#821$#She's a nice, gentle young lady...
#822$#We get along well! But... she's also a love rival.|
53776|#824$#Boohooohooo... does master love Diao Chan or Kotonoha?|
53781|What do you think makes for a great outfit?|
53782|Any secrets to dressing well?|
53783|#823$#Ha! Master is still attractive, even without dressing up!
#822$#But if you dress up nicely, won't Diao Chan have even more rivals to compete with?|
53784|#821$#Eat well, get enough rest, and be sure to exercise. Those are the best ways to stay in shape!
#822$#It will make you look good without doing anything more!|
53785|#821$#Why does Master want to dress up? Don't tell me that you are in love with someone else!
#824$#No! You wouldn't do that to Diao Chan...|
53786|#821$#Actually, as long as you feel good, you will look good. The most important thing is to have self-confidence!|
53791|Have you thought about what your life will be like after we part ways?|
53792|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
53793|#825$#Why? Why would Master suddenly...
#824$#Booo hoo hooo!!|
53794|#821$#Don't underestimate Diao Chan. What makes you think I wait around here at your beck and call?
#822$#Diao Chan will be with you until... until the end of Diao Chan's life!!!|
53795|#822$#Yes! Even if it's just a joke, you can't just say it out loud whenever you want...
#821$#But if that's how it is... It's time to go back to my hometown!|
53796|#821$#Don't say that... Diao Chan can't take a joke!|

24428|Stealthily, you write the question on the board while the Assistant Referee isn't watching. |
24429|The surroundings are eerily familiar, almost exactly as they were in your dreams. You feel a growing sense of dread.|
24430|You were victorious in your dreams, and you're certain you can do it again.|
24431|Something doesn't feel quite right, and you recollect that there was a second commander.|
24432|Jasitra Demontongue appears, just as he did in your dreams.|
24433|You force yourself to stay focused, despite the mounting unease.|
24434|You're well aware that the enemy before you might not be the true Shadow Knight.|
24435|You're left with no choice; you must fight to the bitter end.|
24436|The Shadow Knight transforms into a black flame before your eyes, then vanishes.|
24437|You remain composed, ready for anything.|
24438|Just as in your dreams, a tremendous surge of power begins to suffocate you.|
24439|You feel a familiar sense of pain and desperation. |
24440|After everything that has happened, will the Shadow Knight triumph?|
24441|You refuse to give up, but consciousness is slipping away...|
24442|"It's not over... Open your eyes."|
24443|You hear a gentle voice, and the pain begins to dissipate.|
24444|Your eyes slowly open, and you search for the source of the voice.|
24445|The world is shrouded in a funereal gray.|
24446|A familiar girl appears before you.|
24447|It is the girl from your dreams, and she's trying to speak to you.|
24448|Everything goes dark as consciousness ebbs away, but a power begins to slowly enter your body.|
24449|"Please, you must defeat him..."|
24450|Luciana's soft plea echoes in your ears.|
24451|The Templars have been defeated, and now the Grand Bishop faces the Shadow Knight. |
24452|You watch, helpless, as the Grand Bishop confronts the Shadow Knight alone.|
24453|The potion emits a dazzling glow that lights up the entire room.|
24454|Your strength is slowly returning, and you're able to move your arms and legs.|
24455|Once fully recovered, you rush toward the Grand Bishop.|
24456|A mysterious power engulfs your body, allowing you to block the deadly blow.|
24457|You stare down the Shadow Knight, ready to destroy him.|
24458|After the Shadow Knight speaks, a Magic Circle appears around you.|
24459|Your surroundings begin to twist and crumble, and a cryptic power wrenches you away.|
24460|The Shadow Knight has exiled you to another place.|
24461|There, he can face you alone in a duel to the death.|
24462|You are all alone, the formidable power of the rift swirling around you.|
24463|The Shadow Knight has opened the pathway to Pandemonium. You must stop him!|
24464|It all comes down to this battle. Everything is at stake.|
24465|Defeat the Shadow Knight once and for all!|
24466|"My dear husband, I have always been by your side."|
24467|A gentle voice speaks, suffused with love and warmth.|
24468|Luciana spreads her wings and advances toward the Shadow Knight.|
24469|Luciana turns to you, offering an appreciative bow.|
24470|She approaches the Shadow Knight, and a powerful Magic Circle appears beneath her feet.|
24471|As the Magic Circle vanishes, Luciana and the Shadow Knight disappear.|
24472|The rift radiates with ominous power, hinting at a sinister presence within.|
24473|Standing before the rift, the Grand Bishop begins to cast a spell.|
24474|A vast Magic Circle appears, encompassing the rift.|
24475|For a moment, a benevolent magic suspends the rift's dark power.|
24476|The Grand Bishop wants to speak with you. Go and talk to him.|
24477|The cave is freezing and emanates an ominous power.|
24478|In the depths of the Frozenlea Plains, someone gathers energy to open a portal.|
24479|A rare, potent evil surrounds this person.|
24480|The Frozen Sorcerer drains power from the three Dragon Tyrants.|
24481|Once the Frozen Sorcerer has absorbed all the remaining power, a sinister glow materializes.|
24482|A vast portal opens at his command.|
24483|Frozenlea is instantly engulfed in the nefarious power of Pandemonium.|
24484|The portal opens and a voice, cold as ice, resonates from the depths of Pandemonium.|
24485|"The Shadow Knight has been defeated. You must open a gate to the underworld."|
24486|"A large garrison requires a stable passageway to Terra."|
24487|Magic fire spews from the Shadow Knight's sword, annihilating everything in the hall.|
24488|A human commander orders the garrison to halt at an abandoned village.|
24489|The soldiers move to their assigned positions.|
24490|Ashe and Shirley leave the base, each with a respective squad.|
24491|Everyone pitches in to build a stronghold capable of withstanding the demons.|
24492|The image fades to reveal the emerging stronghold.|
24494|After much hard work, the stronghold is complete.|
24495|Squads move out in each direction.|
24496|Ashe's allies carry him back to the stronghold so that he can recover.|
24497|Ashe survived the emergency procedure, but he will be in a coma for several days.|
24498|As Igar finishes speaking, Ashe struggles to recall something.|
24499|Ashe and Igar are arguing when Asda appears.|
24500|Ashe is recovering quickly, and soon he will be discharged.|
24501|Despite his countless pleas, the order will not be rescinded.  |
24502|Ashe is frightened, initially mistaking the unfamiliar voice for Asda's.|
24503|The pair arrive at the stronghold to find a robot standing in the middle of the field.|
24504|Russell departs, leaving Ashe alone with the robot.|
24505|Ashe and the robot are talking, when suddenly shouts rise up all around them: demons are invading!|
24507|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing an image of Ashe killing the demons.|
24508|Ashe doesn't reply, but smiles bitterly at Asda.|
24509|Shirley awakens from a nightmare, drenched in cold sweat.|
24510|She hears someone approaching and feigns sleep.|
24511|Astonished by the news, Shirley cries out.|
24512|The kidnapper charges at Shirley, and she tries desperately to flee.|
24513|The two kidnappers smile viciously as they approach Shirley.|
24514|Unable to wriggle free, Shirley has no choice but to drink the potion.|
24515|Shirley's body distorts, seized by a bone-wrenching pain.|
24516|Shirley morphs into a demon, her icy eyes trained on the kidnappers.|
24517|Abruptly, Shirley attacks the kidnappers.|
24518|The image fades, slowly revealing Shirley as a demon.|
24519|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing a glimpse of Shirley covered in blood.|
24520|Surveying the corpses at her feet, Shirley composes herself. Though her eyes are filled with tears, she can't help but smile.|
24521|"Come... come here... this is where you belong..."|
24522|"Come..."|
24523|Shirley, utterly entranced, moves toward the voice...|
24524|Ashe destroys another squad of demons and rides the Thousand Nights back to the stronghold.|
24525|Suddenly, Ashe collapses. Anthony rushes him to the medical center.|
24526|Half awake, Ashe struggles to hear an argument between Asda and someone else.|
24527|The two argue beside the bed, unaware that Ashe is awake.|
24528|Though he hasn't yet recovered, Ashe tries to reach the Thousand Nights.|
24529|He walks through a battlefield strewn with corpses.|
24530|The image fades, revealing a battlefield in the midst of war.|
24531|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing an image of the Thousand Nights battling demons.|
24532|Just as Ashe readies a final, fatal blow, the demon speaks...|
24533|Ashe hesitates, and Shirley breaks free.|
24534|Ashe scrambles after her.|
24535|Shirley stumbles, allowing Ashe to catch up with her.|
24536|They stop in the exact spot where Shirley was kidnapped.|
24537|Ashe doesn't hear Shirley clearly.|
24538|The image fades, revealing the robot and the demon.|
24539|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing an image of Ashe desperately defending himself.|
24540|Though Ashe fights valiantly, he is eventually defeated.|
24541|Ashe is unfazed by a heavy blow, stopping at nothing to protect Shirley.|
24542|A full-scale brawl seems inevitable, but no one has picked up a weapon yet.|
24543|Eventually everyone takes up weapons and joins the fray.|
24544|The two smile at each other.|
24545|The opposition launches an attack.|
24546|Enter Level 20 of the Infernal Abyss and use the Energy Storage Light Orb to gather Infernal War Breath. |
24547|This is Level 20 of the Infernal Abyss. Use the Energy Storage Light Orb to gather Infernal War Breath. |
24548|In Level 15, defeat Nazrudin's Nightmare and gather Whirlpool War Breath.|
24549|Use the portal to meet Imma at the Church to discuss the holy sword.|
24550|Infernal Abyss Entrance|
24551|Whirlpool Abyss Entrance|
24552|"The bothersome peons of the human world..."|
24553|"I don't understand... is such caution necessary?"|
24554|"Forget it... since you're all here, let's take a look at you."|
24555|"Are you ready for the chaos of Pandemonium?"|
24556|"Very interesting indeed..."|
24557|"Treasure what little you have, humans."|
24558|"We shall meet again soon."|
24559|Lavalord: The bothersome peons of the human world...|
24560|Lavalord: I don't understand... is such caution necessary?|
24561|Lavalord: Forget it... since you're all here, let's take a look at you.|
24562|Lavalord: Are you ready for the chaos of Pandemonium?|
24563|Lavalord: Very interesting indeed...|
24564|Lavalord: Treasure what little you have, humans.|
24565|Lavalord: We shall meet again soon.|
24566|Shirley is injured, and Ashe pursues her on the Thousand Nights.|
24567|Upon entering the cave, you feel a burning sensation tingle across your skin.|
24568|The lost adventurer should be inside - go find him.|
24569|Suddenly a flame giant appears, blocking the path.|
24570|Defeat the giant, then continue your search for the adventurer.|
24571|Pillars of flame shoot from the ground, and the cave begins to shake violently.|
24572|In the depths of the cave, it is unbearably hot.|
24575|Who knows what Soreth is planning? More important is finding the adventurer inside the cave.|
24576|Flames swirl across the ground, blocking the gate to the depths.|
24578|After defeating Hugh, you can't be sure if the adventurer is safe. Find him quickly!|
24579|The depths are somehow even hotter, perhaps because Soreth has just appeared.|
24580|Ghostweep Fairies are gathering, but their intentions are unclear...|
24581|The Ghostweep Fairies are burning their own flame power to summon the Flame Element King.|
24583||
24584|After defeating the Flame Element King, you hear noises from deep below: the adventurer's distant cries, along with the fierce roar of monsters.|
24586|The Fire Watchdogs are attacking, and their victim looks a whole lot like the adventurer. |
24587|The watchdogs have activated the Beastmaster's Blood! Things couldn't get much worse. Quick, save the adventurer!|
24588|Defeat the Fire Watchdogs and save the adventurer to complete this task.|
24590|Soreth: "I see you've grown a backbone! Well then, come on in."|
24591|Soreth waits inside, and the adventurer is safe for the time being.|
24592|Soreth's plan is anyone's guess. Go inside and save him!|
24593|Suddenly a blazing firestorm appears.|
24594||
24595||
24596||
24597||
24598||
24599||
24600||
24601||
24602|Soreth gathers flame power as the raging fire engulfs him.|
24603|The more power Soreth accumulates, the faster he heals.|
24605|???: "Soreth, at long last I've found you." |
24606||
24607|???: "I didn't want it to come to this, but the general is looking for you. Or perhaps you'd rather I share your little secret?"|
24611|???: "When the time is right, the general will destroy you all, Envoys of Gaia." |
24612|The voice fades, and Soreth disappears.|
24613|The passage ahead has been blocked by fire. The path is impassable.|
24614|Ashe rises after the two have left.|
24615|At that moment, Ashe senses someone else nearby.|
24616|Watch out, everyone! Demons are attacking!|
24617|The message in the orb stops.|
24618|Though he can't identify them, Ashe follows in the hopes of finding Shirley.|
24620|The Mirror Orb floats quietly through the empty hall.|
24621|Sensing people nearby, the Mirror Orb begins to glow.|
24622|You leave the Logging Site and return the robot to the base.|
24623|Welcome, Envoys of Gaia, to the City of Navea! Today we celebrate the founding of our great city.|
24624|The city has organized a carnival with spectacular floats. It's starting now!|
24625|First, we have Endora's float. This is truly a lovely group.|
24626|Can you believe how adorable they are? Please, folks, give them a round of applause.|
24627|Next up, it's the Goddess of Victory. She's absolutely stunning.|
24628|Next is the kind-hearted Kotonoha, along with the cheeky Gemini siblings.|
24629|Kotonoha is truly gracious: look how she waves to everyone in the crowd.|
24630|Finally, we have Alucard and his handsome cohorts.|
24631|They're not bad on the eyes, that's for sure. Marina even saw a few girls faint when they went past!|
24632|The city is also putting on a marvelous fireworks show, which has attracted spectators from near and far.|
24633|The fireworks are taking place in front the military hall, where the soldiers are watching with delight.|
24634|Another dazzling fireworks display at a residential junction has attracted nearby residents.|
24635|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the east. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24636|Rasal: Second battalion, attack! Kick 'em while they're down!|
24637|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the south. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24638|Rasal: Well, well. We'll see how long you can keep this up. The third battalion is ready for attack!|
24639|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the west. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24640|Rasal: This is getting ridiculous. Charge from the north and surround them!|
24641|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the north. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24642|Rasal: Curses! What is this nonsense? Towerbreakers, charge and attack the main tower!|
24643|Towerbreakers are attacking the cube tower from all four sides. Stop them!|
24644|Rasal: You despicable fools. Now I'll show you true power!|
24645|The four cubes react simultaneously, emitting a mysterious energy.|
24646|The Focus Towers are in the final stage of gathering power from the Ruins. Don't let the Varan Bandits interrupt the process!|
24647|Be ready for Rasal's attacks. The Focus Towers must finish charging.|
24648|The powerful energy destroys the Varan Bandits. Rasal is the only one left standing.|
24649|The energy released by the cube destroys all of the Varan Bandits.|
24650|This year's carnival has come to an end. Thank you, everybody, for being part of the celebration. See you next year!|
24651|The Green Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24652|The Red Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24653|The Purple Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24654|The Yellow Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24655|The cube fragments are damaged and unable to resonate. Ensure that all four cubes are working.|
24656|The Focus Towers are destroyed. They will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Fortify the tower defenses.|
24657|Rasal is on the brink of death. Time to strike the final, fatal blow!|
24658|The Focus Towers emit an eerie beam of light.|
30387|The Ancient Emerald Tree stands ahead: use it to upgrade the Artillery Tower and receive higher-grade weapons.|
30388|The fortress has absorbed the Mana Crystal Ore. More energy is needed.|
30389|The fortress' energy level is now above 25%. More energy is needed.|
30390|The fortress' energy level is now above 50%. More energy is needed.|
30391|The fortress' energy level is now above 75%. More energy is needed.|
30392|The fortress has absorbed enough mana. You can now proceed to Stage 2 and build more temporary bases to protect the troops.|
30400|Warning! The demons have torn open a hole in the middle of the battlefield!|
30401|Warning! The energy-gobbling demons are getting closer to the tree and crystal ore - you must stop them!|
30402|Warning! A powerful magic has accumulated! Hide inside the temporary base.|
30403|Attack successfully blocked. The temporary base is now closed.|
30404|Alarm: Warning! Demons are attacking!|
30405|A shrill alarm sounds as a demon horde appears on the battlefield.|
30408|You have successfully gathered Timber, which is needed to upgrade the Artillery Tower.|
30409|You have successfully gathered Mana Crystal Ore, which is needed to upgrade the fortress.|
30410|The battle between humans and demons has only just begun. More demons have appeared!|
30417|Sensing the coming danger, the fortress activates its defenses and sends robots to the battlefield.|
30418|The Artillery Tower is now open! Enter the tower to acquire robot abilities.|
30422|The fuel tank has exploded! The demon is terrified of heat. Ignite a raging fire and raise the temperature!|
30423|Disappeared...  |
30424|Powerful demonic energy floods the area. Its force will weaken anyone outside the stronghold.|
30425|Robots and those within the fortress will be unaffected by the energy.|
30426|Protect the fortress! Access the arsenal and activate the robot!|
30427|You discover a fuel tank. Blowing it up will raise the temperature and eliminate demons and robots.|
30428|A sense of dark evil pervades this place, and the demon statues seem to call out to their comrades on the battlefield.|
30429|The statues can only be damaged by defeating the demons.|
30430|The demons are attacking - protect the stronghold! |
30431|Warning! Demons are attacking! The anti-demon robots await their orders.|
30432|Warning! Air Raid alert! The anti-aircraft robots await their orders.|
30433|The demon army is en route! Use the robots to destroy them.|
30434|The demons take to the skies, protected by crystals. Use the anti-aircraft robots to destroy the crystals!|
30435|The energy field changes abruptly. The demons are wreaking havoc throughout the area!|
30436|Warning! Hit by demon energy! The robots are forced to retreat.|
30437|Warning! Mana reaction destabilization. The demons will destroy everything!|
30438|Warning! Stronghold has detected demon reinforcements. Open the Artillery Tower and join the fight!|
34202|Do-re-mi, ahem... Ooh-wah-ooh, one little bunny is all alone.|
34203|Ooh-wah-ooh, two little bunnies can't find their way home.|
34204|Ooh-wah-ooh, three little bunnies won't sit still... has anybody seen the bridge?|
34205|Someone is trying to eavesdrop on Cesela's song rehearsal.|
34206|Duplicitous types who don't follow instructions ought to be punished!|
35063|The Demon's Blood and Demon's Will clash, causing a momentary reaction.|
35064|Now is the time! Take this opportunity to damage the Demon's Will.|
35065|You shall die along with me!|
35066|You are infected while attacking the Demon's Blood - you can't move any faster!|
35067|You are infected while attacking the Demon's Blood - your spirit is damaged!|
35068|You are infected while attacking the Demon's Blood - your defense is significantly weakened!|
35069|The Demon's Blood has found its way inside Shirley's body, and she can't withstand the contamination.|
35070|You have taken command of Shirley's consciousness. Attack the Demon's Blood and Demon's Will!|
35071|The Demon's Blood, enhanced by Demon's Will, will soon appear!|
35072|Occasionally, Demon's Blood can obscure Demon's Will, and the Will is damaged by the ensuing reaction.|
35073|Successfully subdue a significant amount of Demonic Poison, ensuring that won't reappear for 5 minutes.|
35074|You have successfully thwarted infection from the Demon's Blood. For a short time, you receive Demon Antibodies.|
35075|The Demon's Will is about to expend a significant amount of Demonic Poison.|
35076|Ashe is under attack by an enemy cannon. Be careful not to stand in the firing zone!|
35077|Investigator: Ashe has activated his defensive stance, and it's protecting the demons.|
35078|You have critically damaged Shirley, and now Ashe is furious. He's in Rage Mode!|
35079|Investigator: Separate the two to break the defensive stance!|
35086|Shirley is in danger! When her HP is below 50%, Ashe enters Fortitude Mode.|
35087|While in Fortitude Mode, Ashe's defensive capabilities increase significantly.|
91001|Serif the Samaritan I|
91002|#821$#There was a poor, hungry cat beside the road this morning...

91027|#823$#No way, is that for me?! Merrilee is overjoyed.|
91028|Merrilee's Lesson in Love II|
91029|#822$#To really impress your partner, send her a handmade dish.

91030|#823$#And now - Merrilee's cooking lesson. But remember, the most important ingredient is sincerity!|
91031|Merrilee's Lesson in Love III|
91032|#822$#Great love is often born on the battlefield, you know.
#821$#Girls can't resist a brave fighter. Talk about spoils of war!|
91033|#823$#Wow, Master is so amazing! Even I can't help falling in love.|
91034|Merrilee's Gift of Gratitude|
91035|#821$#Serif's been so nice lately, and I'd love to get him something as a token of gratitude...

91036|#823$#Wonderful, thank you! I really hope Serif likes it.|
91037|Grimm's Little Adventure I|
91038|#821$#Geez, I'm so bored... Wait a minute!

91039|#823$#Rah-haha! I had no idea a little bit of exploring would turn up so much!|
91040|Grimm's Little Adventure II|
91041|#822$#Ra-haha! I just realized there's more written on the back!

91043|Grimm's Little Adventure III|

91046|Gourmand Grimm I|
91047|#824$#Sometimes in the heat of battle I get excited... and that's when I breathe fire! Ra-haha!
#822$#But Grandpa Vayu says I can keep the fire under control with special food...|
91048|#824$#Ra-ha... Yuck! It stinks! Guess I'll hold my nose and eat it quickly...|
91049|Gourmand Grimm II|
91050|#824$#I haven't been able to breathe fire since I ate those weird things!
#822$#Hmm... maybe I need a little something to increase my firepower?|
91051|#823$#Ra-haha! My dragon fire's back!|
91052|Little Grimm in Slumberland|
91053|#821$#A few days ago, I dreamed about a mysterious warrior.

91055|Alessa's Chore Chart|
91056|#821$#Beyond the battlefield, I hold myself to a high standard when it comes to cooking.
#821$#If only Master could help me get some suitable tools!|
91057|#821$#Thank you! What was that? You need a hand? No problem! I am Alessa, after all.|
91058|Stress to Impress I|
91059|#824$#Grimm's room is so filthy... I can't take it anymore!
#821$#Can you get me some cleaning tools? I must tidy this place up!|
91060|#823$#With these, we can at least make things a little better. Master must agree with me on this!|
91061|Stress to Impress II|
91062|#824$#Oh no! I swept up Serif's collectibles while I was cleaning.
#822$#I need your help getting them back - you're my only hope, Master!|
91063|#823$#That's great! Now to arrange the items before Serif returns... Perfect!|
91064|Alessa's Do-Good Diary I|
91065|#821$#In this world, there are lots of people in need. We can't just sit around and do nothing!
#822$#Let's see... today we will take action. I hope Master had a chance to prepare the gifts!|
91066|#823$#I'll never forget the gratitude I get in return for handing out those gifts!|

91070|Alessa's Do-Good Diary III|
91071|#822$#Master, have you heard?
#821$#There are monsters invading! Let's go get 'em!|

91073|Gigas Gears Up I|
91074|#821$#Hear that? The singing contest is about to start. There's no time to lose!
#822$#Quickly, find these items. I must practice my vocals!|
91075|#823$#That's right, these are the items. I have to take care of my vocal cords, so I can sing well!|
91076|Gigas Gears Up II|
91077|#821$#If I don't eat a full meal, I can't sing well!
#821$#It's simply impossible to produce my usual melodious vocals on an empty stomach.|
91078|#823$#Ha! You really do understand me best.|
91079|Gigas' Gig|
91080|#821$#Proper training, done! Now I have to look the part.
#824$#I can't go on stage like this... Please, help me get a few items.|
91081|#823$#This contest'll be a piece of cake! I can do anything with your support.|
91082|Gigas Goes the Distance I|
91083|#822$#Alas, I neglected my battle training to prepare for the singing competition...
#821$#That's not good at all. Get me a boost potion - we must train quickly!|
91084|#823$#Excellent! With a hefty stock of potions, we'll have the advantage on the battlefield.|
91085|Gigas Goes the Distance II|
91086|#821$#A strong defense is crucial to gaining the upper hand on the battlefield.
#822$#We've talked long enough - it's time to prepare!|
91087|#823$#Exactly! A strong defense can make even the most powerful attack ineffective.|
91088|Gigas Goes Gaia|
91089|#822$#My inspiration comes from the Cube of Gaia, as does my power!
#821$#If you want to be stronger, you'll need materials for the Power of Gaia.|
91090|#822$#Ha! These items are all we need to make the key?
#823$#They've become part of me, haha!|
91091|Wolfgang Aelius Mozart I|
91092|#822$#Music is the most powerful thing in the world, don't you agree?
#821$#Would you like to listen to my performance? Then perhaps you can help me acquire a few items.|
91093|#823$#Thanks! Now I can take good care of my instrument.|
91094|Wolfgang Aelius Mozart II|
91095|#822$#The most beautiful melodies come from great composers... and naturally I compose my own music.
#821$#But I could really use some inspiration right about now. Perhaps you can suggest a muse?|
91096|#823$#Ooh, perfect! I've never felt so inspired!|
91097|Welcome to the Dollhouse|
91098|#824$#It's been so rainy recently, and I've been feeling gloomy.
#821$#But Ms. Shirayuki gave me a doll that fills the days with sunshine!|
91099|#823$#Isn't this called a Sunshine Monk Doll in the north?|
91100|Amped-Up Aelius I|
91101|#821$#I was hoping you could help me... er, I mean, help my friend... get a few things to conquer his weakness.|
91102|#823$#Aha! Thank you! I certainly... I mean, I'm sure my friend will appreciate these!|
91103|Amped-Up Aelius II|
91104|#822$#Do you know what those of us with powers of fire fear the most?
#821$#These items would be a big help... I must be more courageous! I'm counting on you!|
91105|#823$#Thank you so much! I wonder if that sister of mine is collecting the same things...|
91106|Heart of the Sun|
91107|#821$#Keys of Gaia are the source of power for all Eidolons; the more we evolve, the greater our strengths become.
#822$#Perhaps with sufficient materials I can increase my strength...|
91108|#823$#So this is what it looks like before a key is formed? The Power of Gaia is indeed profound...|
91109|Abraxas' Heel I|
91110|#821$#A weakness? Me? Haha, that's rich!
#822$#What, you've heard I have a weakness? All right, then - let's see some evidence!|
91111|#822$#Huh? How dare you! I certainly don't believe in ghosts!|
91112|Abraxas' Heel II|
91113|#821$#You still don't believe I'm perfect? Ha!
#822$#In fact, I'm so perfect I'll accept any challenge you bring me! Also, while we're on the topic... who told you this?|
91114|#822$#Whoa! They look a bit... wet. Nonetheless, I'm happy to accept them!|
91115|Abraxas' Heel III|
91116|#822$#Still trying to figure out my weakness, are you? You've got a lot of spirit! Haha!
#821$#If you can't find anything this time, I'll be the undisputed winner!|
91117|#824$#Aah! It had to be Tsubaki who told you! Get away from me... you can't make me eat this stuff!|
91118|Pumping Iron I|
91119|#821$#You can't just learn exquisite fighting moves like mine - you have to be born with them!
#822$#Well, maybe with lots of practice... Here, you can start by getting these items!|
91120|#823$#Ha! Don't worry about not being as good as me - at least you'll look nice trying!|
91121|Pumping Iron II|
91122|#821$#Good! Now collect these items and bring them to me. I'll be testing you on what you've learned!
#822$#What? Why do I need these things? Don't ask, just get them! Chop, chop!|
91123|#823$#Ah! Nothing like a few sports drinks to replenish your electrolytes after a workout, eh? Haha!|
91124|Abraxas Ascending|
91125|#821$#What, I need this? This?
#822$#You summoned me here just for this? What am I, your lowly servant?|
91126|#823$#Ah! Thank you so much! To sense my own soul in this fragment... It's magical!|
91127|The Imperial Diaries I|
91128|#821$#I think you have a lot of potential. So, how about it - want to learn how to be a ruler?
#822$#First things first: bring me these items!|
91129|#823$#Nicely done! You've learned the first step of being a king: learning how to serve! Haha!|
91130|The Imperial Diaries II|
91131|#821$#The next step to becoming a ruler is taking on powerful enemies to prove your skills.
#822$#Go ahead, take out some baddies. And bring back some loot to prove it!|
91132|#823$#Aha, nicely done! I knew you wouldn't prove me wrong!|
91133|The Imperial Diaries III|
91134|#821$#All right, final lesson! To truly reign, you must give what matters most: your heart and soul!
#822$#Are you willing to give me these things unquestioningly? This will be your last test.|
91135|#823$#Wonderful! You're perfectly suited to be my servant! What? I said I'd teach you to be a ruler? Nonsense!|
91136|Errands for Eligos I|
91137|#821$#As you may already know, I'm a world-renowned collector.
#822$#However, there's something missing from my treasure room... I have a feeling you know what I mean.|
91138|#823$#Ah! You are indeed the most loyal of my subjects!|
91139|Errands for Eligos II|
91140|#821$#You've certainly shown some exceptional abilities. But just to be sure, I need you to get a few more things.
#822$#Okay, fine - it's more than a few. Now, get to it! That's an order!|
91141|#823$#Very good, very good indeed! I knew you wouldn't disappoint me!|
91142|Eligos' Endgame|
91143|#821$#Now, then... The reason I summoned you in the first place...
#822$#After all is said and done, there's no one in the world who reminds me more of myself than you do.|
91144|#823$#Ah, but now I see - it is this power that has brought me to you!|
91145|Sigrun Kicks It Up a Notch I|
91146|#821$#Your dietary habits are rather worrisome... But I have an idea!
#822$#I can prepare meals for you. All I need are these tools.|
91147|#823$#That's fantastic. I had, erm, no idea how to MAKE these dishes. Ahaha, hrm, yes...|
91148|Sigrun Kicks It Up a Notch II|
91149|#822$#I've compiled a few healthy recipes, and now you can help me gather the ingredients.
#821$#This is going to be great!|
91150|#823$#Voila! Here, try some of this. Hey, are you okay?|
91151|Sensei Sigrun I|
91152|#821$#You need a good weapon for battle, preferably one with a human attribute bonus.
#822$#Those wild creatures are nothin' - greedy humans are the worst enemies!|
91153|#823$#Haha! You're my trusted friend, and thus you'll never feel the steel of my blade.|
91154|Sensei Sigrun II|
91155|#821$#It goes without saying that only a real battle can truly hone your skills.
#822$#But these enemies are a piece of cake for you!|
91156|#823$#Haha! Looks like I've got nothing left to teach you! |
91157|Sensei Sigrun III|
91158|#821$#There's a vital piece of equipment that every hero is destined to have...
#822$#If I could get my hands on it, my powers would be even stronger!|
91159|#823$#Yes, that's it! This brings me back to the days when my comrades and I fought valiantly, side by side...|
91160|Sigrun's Solemn Swear|
91161|#821$#I'm completely loyal to my master, but I am bound by an oath.
#822$#Sometimes I wonder if my master will uphold this oath...|
91162|#823$#You upheld the oath! I knew I was right to trust you.|
91163|Bosom Buddies I|
91164|#821$#Tsubaki is my friend, but recently I haven't seen her much.
#821$#Here, this is Tsubaki's most favorite most precious thing ever!|
91165|#821$#Thanks so much!|
91166|Bosom Buddies II|
91167|#821$#The Dragon Tyrant came by to say hello, and we had a great time chatting.
#821$#This is a token of appreciation for my friend.|
91168|#821$#Thanks so much!|
91169|Nalani's Night Terrors|
91170|#821$#I take my dreams very seriously. Dreams might not be real, but they can be extremely insightful.
#821$#I'm worried about the items I saw in my dreams.|
91171|#821$#Dreams are fantasy, but they seem so real...|
91172|Nalani's Curb Appeal I|
91173|#821$#I've got a passion for renovating things.
#821$#Could you collect these tools for me?|
91174|#821$#After collecting the tools... I need...|
91175|Nalani's Curb Appeal II|
91176|#821$#As for finding the materials... I'm going to need your help.|
91177|#821$#Are you ready to behold a masterpiece?|
91178|Nalani's Deep Thoughts|
91179|#821$#I came from the Cube of Gaia... Then I met you.
#821$#What could have created this bond?|
91180|#821$#Kindred spirits fit together like pieces of a puzzle, don't you think? You truly are my soulmate.|
91181|Training Montage I|
91182|#821$#My training is tough!
#822$#Make sure you eat a full meal, or you won't be able to keep up.|
91183|#823$#Master sets a bad example. Eating a full meal doesn't mean eating too much!|
91184|Training Montage II|
91185|#822$#Okay, let's aim for the targets on the list.
#821$#They're the easiest, but still give it your best shot!|
91186|#823$#Impressive. How was it? You're sweating like a pig... But you should be proud of yourself!|
91187|Uzuriel's Killer Instinct I|
91188|#821$#Remember the training from last time? Let's put it to the test!
#822$#The target is wary this time around... we'll need to lure him out with something.|
91189|#823$#You never know... you might be a better killer than I am... Heh, just forget I said that.|
91190|Uzuriel's Killer Instinct II|
91191|#821$#The trap is set, but we must proceed with caution.
#824$#I can't shake this feeling that something bad is about to happen...|
91192|#824$#Was the target hit? It looks like I was worried for nothing.|
91193|Uzuriel's Killer Instinct III|
91194|#822$#The target has been eliminated, but our mission isn't over...
#821$#The looted items are nowhere to be found, and we have to get them back.|
91195|#824$#I can't imagine how things would be if the organization was in charge...|
91196|Uzuriel Uncovered|
91197|#821$#I've been away from the organization for a long time... I wonder what my comrades are up to?
#824$#If only there were pieces of the Key of Gaia...|
91198|#822$#This... wow, I'm speechless. Thank you so much. Next up, it's...|
91199|Bel-Chandra's Beauty Bar I|
91200|#822$#Want to know the secret to my beautiful figure? Why, exercise and dancing, of course!
#821$#However, to get REALLY great results, I use a special beauty cream. It requires very particular ingredients...|
91201|#823$#Wonderful! With these ingredients, even a Cyclops could have a body like mine! Haha!|
91202|Bel-Chandra's Beauty Bar II|
91203|#822$#Dancing can help keep you in shape, but if you really want to be perfect...
#821$#You need to watch what you eat! And I have just the recipes...|
91204|#823$#And the last step is to eat it ALL! What, why aren't you eating? Aren't you hungry?|
91205|Bel-Chandra's Beauty Bar III|
91206|#822$#To be a truly elegant dancer, you need to accessorize!
#821$#Here, get me all of these items! I'll need time to pick out the perfect one...|
91207|#823$#Haha! Gorgeous! I thought you wanted to be beautiful? Don't be bothered by these little things! |
91208|Bel-Chandra Breaks the Ice|
91209|#822$#Shirayuki and I want to organize a dinner dance, but I can't show up empty-handed.
#821$#Help me collect these items, so I can bring a special beverage to share.|
91210|#823$#Excellent! Look at those delicious purple bubbles... Of course, you can have some too!|
91211|Bel-Chandra Blisses Out|
91212|#822$#Meditation and mental focus is the only way to become stronger.
#821$#Let's see what you're made of!|
91213|#823$#Ha, that's pretty impressive! It looks like your training methods work, too.|
91214|Bel-Chandra's Bond|
91215|#822$#I knew it... you received a piece of my spirit from the Cube of Gaia.
#821$#We're not strangers anymore - let me see the secret item!|
91216|#823$#Haha! See how my lightning makes these fragments shimmer!|
91217|Soaking Up the Rays I|
91218|#822$#Master, it's so nice out: a perfect day for sunbathing.
#821$#You've never heard of sunbathing? Ha! In that case, I'd like to ask you to prepare a few items.|
91219|#823$#Ha! That's great. Now we just need to mix these into a paste and apply it to the skin...|
91220|Soaking Up the Rays II|
91221|#822$#A sunburn? Impossible! Didn't you use my special... Oh!
#821$#I nearly forgot that you're a human. Hmm, I'll need to adjust the formula a bit.|
91222|#823$#I think I've got it! Try this new formula - now you should be able to enjoy the sun!|
91223|Vayu's Forbidden Scales|
91224|#823$#I'm furious right now - don't even try to touch my...
#824$#Just forget it! I can't force you to apologize.|
91225|#821$#So... I admit, I may have overreacted.|
91226|Didactic Dragon I|
91227|#822$#After last time, it's safe to say I should teach you some basic dragon manners.
#821$#These are some of a dragon's favorite things. If you don't mind, please collect them.|
91228|#823$#My kind is also keenly interested in treasure...|
91229|Didactic Dragon II|
91230|#822$#Dragons have a very different diet than humans...
#821$#Here are a few simple recipes - they're yours to keep.|
91231|#823$#Delicious! That hits the spot!|
91232|Vayu's Ultimate Sacrifice|
91233|#822$#Master, I'm absolutely loyal to you. I'll always be by your side.
#821$#I shall ask the Cube of Gaia to give you half my soul, as a pledge of my loyalty.|
91234|#823$#I was destined to find a Master like you...|
91235|Tea Time with Nazrudin I|
91236|#821$#This is such a lovely day. I wonder...
#822$#Would Master like to help me collect materials for making tea?|
91237|#823$#These might not seem useful, but they're very precious indeed.|
91238|Tea Time with Nazrudin II|
91239|#821$#This tea would be perfect with some delicious snacks.
#822$#Master, would you mind collecting a few tasty things to go with our tea?|
91240|#823$#Master, you must be exhausted by all these preparations. Let's sit down and enjoy this lovely tea.|
91241|Gnarly Nazrudin|
91242|#821$Is Master interested in surfing? I love it!
#822$Why don't we hit the waves for a few days?|
91243|#823$#The water is very deep. If Master is afraid, just hold on to me.|
91244|Building a Better Butler I|
91245|#821$#Does Master want to know what it takes to be an excellent butler?
#822$#First and foremost, you must have a refined sense of taste. Shall we try this first?|
91246|#823$#Ooh! You've chosen the best of all the items. Truly, Master has excellent taste.|
91247|Building a Better Butler II|
91248|#821$#Next, you need the best possible equipment. As a butler, your foremost duty is protecting your master.
#822$#You can't defend your master without the proper equipment. And of course, appearance is important too!|
91249|#823$#Not bad at all. You're a pretty good butler, Master. But you've got some work to do to be at my level.|
91250|An Arctic Appeal|
91251|#821$#I've been traveling with Master for quite a while, and I'd like to make a small request...
#822$#I'd like to obtain a few items that can hold my power, such as fragments from the Key of Gaia.|
91252|#823$#Now that's what I call being a true friend. Thanks so much, Master!|
91253|Yarnaros Takes Flight I|
91254|#823$#Does my extraordinary flying technique scare you? Ha!
#824$#Want to see it again? It's really not that hard. Just hand over your entry tickets! |
91255|#823$#I've wanted this for a long time! You're welcome to watch the show anytime you want.|
91256|Yarnaros Takes Flight II|
91257|#822$#The last performance got pretty good reviews... It's just...
#824$#It could be so much better. Perhaps you can help me get a few decorations so I can add some flair.|
91258|#823$#Not bad! I had no idea we had such similar taste!|
91259|Dieting Dragons I|
91260|#821$#Quickly! Empty your pockets!
#822$#You can't? Then give me these items, they'll do the trick. Hurry!|
91261|#823$#Ha! With these, I can set a bunch of traps and catch more food!|
91262|Dieting Dragons II|
91263|#821$#Of course I realize I can't just eat meat...
#822$#But just eating vegetables won't do either. Bring on the meat!|
91264|#824$#What's the point of eating at all if I can't have a nutritious meal?|
91265|Dieting Dragons III|
91266|#821$#Where does this newfound interest in nutrition come from? Well...
#824$#It all started when Bel-Chandra said I was too fat to fly. Maybe a balanced diet can help me slim down.|
91267|#823$#I haven't gotten any slimmer, but I certainly feel stronger...|
91268|A Tempered Tantrum|
91269|#822$#This isn't fair! Give me back my spirit fragments.
#821$#With help from the Power of Gaia, I can fly to the sun!|
91270|#823$#Excellent! Watch me fly to the sun with my stunning golden wings!|
91271|Quelkulan's Cauldron I|
91272|#821$#You've arrived at the perfect time. Can you help me?
#822$#I'm researching a potion, and it just so happens that I need something...|
91273|#823$#Thanks so much! I'll let you know what my research uncovers.|
91274|Quelkulan's Cauldron II|
91275|#824$#This biological experiment is proving to be troublesome...
#821$#You're here just in time. Help me find something that can neutralize the toxins!|
91276|#823$#My vaccine didn't work, but thanks to you the day is saved!|
91277|Quelkulan's Cauldron III|
91278|#821$#There's a problem with the formula... Here, and here...
#822$#There, I've revised it! I need your help acquiring the materials.|
91279|#823$#I'm absolutely confident it'll work this time. Do you want to try it? Hey wait, where are you going?|
91280|Quelkulan Makes Amends I|
91281|#824$#When I'm emotional, I can't stop myself from spitting poison...
#821$#I feel awful, and I'd like to apologize to the innocents who died because of me...|
91282|#822$#Perhaps I can use these items as an offering to those who died.|
91283|Quelkulan Makes Amends II|
91284|#821$#Once I accidentally poisoned an entire lake...
#824$Though it's been neutralized, the lake's ecosystem is still so fragile...|
91285|#822$#These fish hatchlings will go a long way toward restoring the lake.|
91286|Quelled Experiment|
91287|#822$#I can tell I'm not at my full potential.
#821$#There must be something I can do to maximize my strength...|
91288|#823$#Isn't this my soul fragment? Won't it poison you if you keep it?|
91289|Zaahir Plays with Fire I|
91290|#823$#Wow, I haven't breathed this much fire in ages.
#821$#Hey, kid! You better get your gear ready, or you'll be burnt to a crisp!|
91291|#823$#Excellent! This should be ready to go.|
91292|Zaahir Plays with Fire II|
91293|#821$#I can't breathe fire under these conditions! I must have some refreshments first.
#823$#Don't just stand there, kid - go get some of my favorite food!|
91294|#824$#Haha! Good food is bliss. Hmm, a fire test? Yes, yes, after my nap.|
91295|Ramen with the Devil I|
91296|#821$#Speaking of food, would you like to try my hometown delicacy?
#824$#You'll have to bring your own tools and ingredients, though. I can't afford all that!|
91297|#823$#Haha! I can see in your eyes how much you want to try it!|
91298|Ramen with the Devil II|
91299|#821$#This ramen can't be eaten without the special seasoning!
#822$#It is, after all, a delicacy from the inferno...|
91300|#823$#Let's eat! Haha, the expression on your face is priceless!|
91301|Zaahir Lets Loose|
91302|#821$#Kid, did you know that my attribute is the wild flame?
#824$#If only I could enhance it... I'd be stronger than ever!|
91303|#823$#Bwahaha! Behold the incredible power of my fire!|
91304|Zaahir's On Fire|
91305|#823$#Hey, kid! What were you just holding?
#821$#Is that... it couldn't be... the item my core is destined to possess... |
91306|#823$#Amazing, that's actually it! Thank you!|
91307|Cyril Balances the Scales I|
91308|#822$#Justice is often defined as helping those in need...
#821$#If justice is important to you, complete the task I have given you.|
91309|#823$#Very good. This is a great start.|
91310|Cyril Balances the Scales II|
91311|#821$#Next is the selection of weapons. Though anyone can wield a weapon, its effect is not always the same...
#822$#Each fighter has a unique style and advantage, and each weapon can be modified in a special way.|
91312|#823$#You must master the modification process. This will allow you to enhance your weapons and equipment.|
91313|Cyril Balances the Scales III|
91314|#822$#The outcome of a fair fight depends on the experience of the fighters.
#821$#You must prove that you truly understand the importance of battle experience.|
91315|#823$#That's correct. I imagine you have carefully developed your own advantage on the battefield.|
91316|Cyril's Swordplay I|
91317|#821$#Does Master know the best way to improve swordsmanship?
#822$#By hunting as much as possible! Let's stop standing around and chase down some prey! |
91318|#823$#You are indeed my Master. Such flawless attacks... Your skills are impressive.|
91319|Cyril's Swordplay II|
91320|#822$#Another training session? Ha! Then it's time to get some proper equipment.
#821$#Done! Now for the proper auxiliary equipment...|
91321|#823$#Perfect! An ideal option for a fighter like you.|
91322|Chivalrous Cyril|
91323|#824$#May I be so bold as to ask a favor?
#822$#I had hoped that Master would give me some soul fragments, with which I can increase my power...|
91324|#823$#The Cube of Gaia has tasked me with accompanying Master forever.|
91325|Kotonoha's Fan Club I|
91326|#821$#A fan club? For me? Heehee!
#822$#Maybe we should distribute gifts to thank everyone?|
91327|#823$#It's true... I like Master most of all!|
91328|Kotonoha's Fan Club II|
91329|#821$#Ha! Is Master concerned about my fan club? Don't worry - you're the only one with a place in my heart.
#822$#What about this... if you're willing to help me find something, Master would be handsomely rewarded.|
91330|#823$#Heehee! I'll disband the fan club, just to prove that you mean the most to me.|
91331|Kotonoha's Little Secret|
91332|#821$#Master, I have a teeny little request...
#822$#My collection is missing something, and I'd like to ask for your help.|
91333|#823$#Heehee! This collection is my little secret. Please, don't tell anyone!|
91334|Kotonoha's Silky Skin I|
91335|#821$#The weather's been so arid lately... could Master do me a small favor?
#822$#This is the formula for my skincare cream. Perhaps you could help me gather the ingredients?|
91336|#823$#Heehee! Master is welcome to touch my skin.|
91337|Kotonoha's Silky Skin II|
91338|#821$#Exercise is key if you want smooth, supple skin.
#822$#If I could get these treasures, I might consider exercising with you...|
91339|#823$#Heehee! You're so amazing, Master. I bet everyone loves you!|
91340|You Can't Handle the True Form|
91341|#821$#You'd like to see my true form? Well, of course...
#822$#But only if Master gives me what I want!|
91342|#823$#Heehee! Master is so nice. What's that, my true form? But Master, didn't you know that I'm always in my true form?|
91343|Eye of the Tiger I|
91344|#821$#If you can't win a battle, don't bother discussing tactics. As for the easiest way to win...
#822$#Never turn your back on the enemy! Now do you understand?|
91345|#821$#Exactly! Preparation is key.|
91346|Eye of the Tiger II|
91347|#821$#Proper tactics are also important for winning battles. Setting traps is often necessary.
#822$#If you can, get the materials and start trapping prey!|
91348|#823$#Not too shabby. Clearly you've taken my lessons to heart.|
91349|Go Get 'Em, Tiger|
91350|#821$#Impressing ladies? Ha! You've come to the right place.
#822$#If you prepare these items, you'll be breaking hearts left and right!|
91351|#823$#Useless, you say? You must be doing something wrong!|
91352|Tigerius Got Talent I|
91353|#822$#Gigas is so talented. It'd be a pity if he didn't work for me.
#821$#Let's do something to convince him to join!|
91354|#823$#Ha! We can still be friends, even if Gigas isn't interested.|
91355|Tigerius Got Talent II|
91356|#822$#Cleopawtra's quite a beauty, eh? What, you think I have ulterior motives? No way!
#821$#It's just, she has such a nice figure... Anyway, let's get her some of her favorite things!|
91357|#823$#Wonderful! This should make my feelings - I mean, OUR feelings - abundantly clear!|
91358|The Age of Tigerius|
91359|#821$#My thirst for knowledge about the Key of Gaia knows no bounds. Its structure, its origin...
#822$#There are few subjects I find so fascinating...|
91360|#823$#Aha! So the fragments were assembled into the key that brought me here? Incredible!|
91361|Bahadur, Bahadur, Blacksmith I|
91362|#821$#If you want to survive on the battlefield, you'd better be sure your weapon is in tip-top shape!
#822$#Of course, the materials you use to maintain your weapon should be of the finest quality. Now, go get them!|
91363|#823$#Haha! Perfect! In order to become a true ruler, you must pay attention to the finest details...|
91364|Bahadur, Bahadur, Blacksmith II|
91365|#821$#The care and cleaning of guns is an entirely new branch of knowledge. Of course, it requires entirely different materials...
#822$#Going somewhere? Then I assume I can count on you to bring back these materials, yes? Haha!|
91366|#823$#I knew I could count on you! That wasn't so bad, was it? Haha!|
91367|Bahadur, Bahadur, Blacksmith III|
91368|#824$#What, you think we're finished? Nonsense! A weapon's maintenance isn't finished until it's been tested in battle!
#821$Since we'll be doing some fighting, you may as well help me collect these items!|
91369|#823$#Not only do we vanquish our foes, but the spoils of war make us stronger. It's like killing two birds with one stone! Haha!|
91370|Love Your Labyrinth I|
91371|#821$#I think the time has come to renovate my command post. But the workers need food! Quickly!
#822$#|
91372|#824$#That took far too long! Ah, but it appears to be high-quality stuff... perhaps there's hope for you after all!|
91373|Love Your Labyrinth II|
91374|#822$#The major renovations are complete... now this place needs some decoration.
#821$#Unfortunately, I'm too busy commanding my troops. I'll leave the decorating up to you!|
91375|#823$#Ah, perfect! I'll have the most beautiful labyrinth on the block! Haha!|
91376|The Key to My Gaia|
91377|#821$#I've always felt that the Key of Gaia contained part of my spirit.
#823$#The power of the Cube of Gaia is truly phenomenal!|
91378|#824$#Ah, incredible - that such a tiny thing could contain the power of one such as I! Haha!|
91379|Neglectful Ninja I|
91380|#822$#A true ninja can take a thousand forms! Now behold... Smoke Stance! Haha!
#821$#Oh! It appears Tsubaki has used all her smoke bombs. How can this be? Please, Master, help Tsubaki! |
91381|#823$#Yes, perfect! Just add this, a pinch of this, and... BOOM! Tsubaki is amazing, is she not?|
91382|Neglectful Ninja II|
91383|#822$#Tsubaki has other tricks up her sleeve besides smoke bombs. For example: throwing kunai!
#821$#Tsubaki makes them herself! Behold! HI-YA! Oh... I seem to have run out...|
91384|#823$#Ah, Master! Tsubaki will be with you forever!|
91385|Iron Chef Tsubaki I|
91386|#821$#You think Tsubaki should practice cooking? But why? She's already so good at it!
#822$#I can prove it! I just need a few ingredients, Master. Tsubaki will surely surprise you with her cooking skills!|
91387|#823$#Feeling hungry? Good! Just a slice of this... and a pinch of this... then mix it all together...|
91388|Iron Chef Tsubaki II|
91389|#821$#Ah, Master! It's terrible! Please, I need more ingredients...
#822$#It's for Zaahir - he ate some of the food I made, and somehow he got food poisoning!|
91390|#823$#Ah, wonderful! With these ingredients, I shall create Tsubaki's famous food-poisoning antidote!|
91391|Tsubaki's Truest Friend|
91392|#821$#The anniversary of when I first met Nalani is approaching. I have to prepare something!
#822$#Hmm... I have an idea... With Master's help, I'm sure I can pull it off!|
91393|#823$#Thank you, Master! Tsubaki loves you most of all!|
91394|Tsubaki in the Rough|
91395|#821$#Tsubaki knows that only those favored by the Eidolons can get Eidolon Keys.
#822$#Do... do you think Tsubaki has an Eidolon Key of her own?|
91396|#823$#Ah, it's beautiful! And so shiny! Thank you, Master, thank you!|
91398|#822$#Serena is envious of Master's ability to decorate weapons so beautifully.
#821$#Perhaps Serena could try decorating her picture book as well...|
91399|#823$#Ah! Master is the best! Serena will get started right away...|
91401|#821$#Serena's illustrations are coming along nicely. But more colors would certainly be nice...
#822$#What do you say, Master? Can you get Serena some more colors?|
91402|#823$#Thank, you, Master! With Kaiser Zeta's help, Serena will be able to turn these into such beautiful colors of paint!|
91404|#822$#Serena has heard tales of fabulous treasures buried underground...
#821$#Go, Master! Get some treasures for Serena! Yes!|
91405|#823$#Wow! Serena isn't sure what all of these things are... but she knows they look pretty!|
91407|#822$#Serena's moon looks a bit... shaky these days.
#824$#You don't think Serena got too fat, do you? Ah, no, it probably just needs some maintenance. Think of a solution, Master!|
91408|#823$#Ah, Master is a genius! Serena knew she could count on you!|
91410|#821$#Ever since Master's skillful repairs, Serena's moon is much more stable!
#822$#But it could still use a bit more work, could it not?|
91411|#823$#Master's forging skills can even be used on Serena's moon! Master, you're the best!|
91413|#821$#Master! I heard... I heard you gave Serena's key fragments to someone else!
#824$#How... how could you do such a thing?|
91414|#823$#Ah! So it was all a misunderstanding? Forgive me, Master! Serena likes you best of all!|
91415|Been There, Dune That I|
91416|#822$#Would you like to hear a story about the kingdom?
#823$#Stories aren't free, you know! All I ask is a small token in exchange for my tale...|
91417|#821$#Ha! I never imagined you'd be interested in my homeland.|
91418|Been There, Dune That II|
91419|#821$#My kingdom evolved in this endless desert, beneath the scorching sun.
#823$#Just thinking about it makes me parched... Why are you still standing there?|
91420|#822$#Hmm... The refreshments here aren't bad!|
91421|Been There, Dune That III|
91422|#822$#So... My kingdom is very similar to the Star Sand Desert. Beautiful and vast...
#821$#This reminds me, can you bring me something indigenous to the desert for my collection?|
91423|#823$#Ha! These items certainly do have a desert feel to them...|
91424|Cleopawtra's Top Servant|
91425|#821$#I'm positive you'll be able to get these things.
#823$I'll wait for you. Go now!|
91426|#821$#You are my most trustworthy companion.|
91427|Cleopawtra's Treasure|
91428|#822$#You're still young, so you couldn't possibly know that this land holds many precious items.
#821$#Can you help me find this treasure?|
91429|#823$#Aren't these things beautiful? So much antiquity...|
91430|By Order of Cleopawtra|
91431|#821$#Give me the key fragments! That's an order!|
91432|#823$#Ha! You really are infatuated with me. Well anyway, thanks!|
91433|Endora's Charms I|
91434|#821$#It's so nice out today. What a perfect day to meet Serif!
#823$#All I need is my good looks and perhaps a few flowers... please, Master!|
91435|#822$#Haha! Serif won't be able to resist me!|
91436|Endora's Charms II|
91437|#822$#Listen to this, Master... Last time I saw Serif, he had this awful pink hair!
#824$#This is infuriating. Bring me snacks! I'm going to eat my way through this frustration!|
91438|#822$#Mmmm... Master and snacks are my truest friends. But I refuse to give up!|
91439|Endora's Box I|
91440|#821$#Tomorrow is Grimm's birthday... which means it's time to play a few pranks!
#822$#Master shall be in charge of the materials. Hmm? But there aren't any other options to choose!|
91441|#823$#Haha! This gift will scare the pants off of Grimm!|
91442|Endora's Box II|
91443|#823$#Hmm... Perhaps if we set off some fireworks right behind Nazrudin...
#821$#Pardon me, Master, but I'll need your help again. We're in the same boat, after all!|
91444|#822$#Haha! That old geezer will be scared to death!|
91445|Endora's Box III|
91446|#823$#Last but not least, a prank for that awful pink-haired Serif! Let me think...
#821$#Ha! That'll do the trick. Get ready, Master! This must be perfectly executed.|
91447|#822$#Ha! This should scare the daylights out of that candy-haired fool!|
91448|True Romance|
91449|#822$#Haha, I know what to give Serif!
#821$#I'll give him the best gift of all: ME! Please help me get ready, Master.|
91450|#823$#Heehee, Serif won't be able to resist!|
91451|Vermilion's Vexation I|
91452|#824$#Master hasn't eaten much recently...
#821$#Vermilion made these, and Master might like to try them...|
91453|#822$#Stupid fool! Why did you make fish?!|
91454|Vermilion's Vexation II|
91455|#824$#Master still looks lethargic...
#821$#Vermilion is thinking of offering these... They will give Master newfound energy!|
91456|#822$#Stupid fool! Why a hat? Is it supposed to boost self-confidence?|
91457|Vermilion's Vexation III|
91458|#823$#Master looks more energetic! Perhaps because Master is meeting a certain special someone?
#821$#Is there anything that can be done to help?|
91459|#822$#Ridiculous humans! Stupid fool! Ah well, thanks anyway.|
91460|Vermilion See, Vermilion Do I|
91461|#824$#How do you cope with such a difficult battle?
#821$#Vermilion wants to be like you... Wearing such impressive armor!|
91462|#822$#Stupid fool! How are you supposed to move around in this outfit?|
91463|Vermilion See, Vermilion Do II|
91464|#821$#How is Master so good at fishing?
#823$#Vermilion wants to be a fishing expert too!|
91465|#822$#Stupid fool! Whose idea was it to learn how to fish?|
91466|Vermilion's Victory|
91467|#824$#Why is Vermilion here?
#822$#Ridiculous humans, showing this to such a stupid fool!|
91468|#823$#Isn't this... Vermilion's? This is fantastic! Vermilion has been blessed by the Power of Gaia!|
91469|Shirayuki's Pet Patrol I|
91470|#822$#Sigh... Willow seems so listless...
#821$#If only I had a few simple ingredients, I could make some pet food...|
91471|#823$#Thanks so much! Master must also be worried about Willow.|
91472|Shirayuki's Pet Patrol II|
91473|#821$#Willow is looking better now, all thanks to Master!
#822$#Now if only there were a few pet toys to cheer up Willow...|
91474|#823$#For me? Wonderful! Willow will be delighted.|
91475|Shirayuki's Snow Song|
91476|#822$#My singing always brings the snow and wind...
#821$#Master, I hope you can stay warm while I sing for you.|
91477|#823$#Haha! Such kind words, Master. I shall heed your advice...|
91478|Dining and Dancing I|
91479|#821$#Don't laugh, Master, but Bel-Chandra and I are organizing a dinner dance!
#822$#Can you assist with the preparations? I'm hoping to get these things ready first...|
91480|#823$#You're so reliable, Master!|
91481|Dining and Dancing II|
91482|#822$#The preparations are nearly complete! Now for the food...
#821$#Bel-Chandra and I can take care of most of it, but I need your help with the fish.|
91483|#823$#Haha! This event will be fantastic!|
91484|Sincerely, Shirayuki|
91485|#821$#I've been at Master's side for so long... I wonder, what does Master think of me?
#822$#I'll never forget how I was brought to you by this special item...|
91486|#823$#I really believe the Cube of Gaia wants to see me at your side. I feel so lucky!|
91487|Mecha-Maintenance I|
91488|#821$#Expert repair is the key to staying in tip-top form!
#822$#I need a few things to finish these repairs... I don't suppose you could help me out, could you?|
91489|#823$#If this metal body didn't always need fixing, it'd be pretty convenient! Haha!|
91490|Mecha-Maintenance II|
91491|#821$#Regular maintenance is just as important as repairs - it's never good to look old and worn-out!
#822$#You wouldn't want me breaking down, would you? No? Then help me out!|
91492|#823$#Haha! Whatever the task, I can always count on you!|
91493|Mecha-Maintenance III|
91494|#822$#Now that we're done with repairs and maintenance, all that's left is...
#821$#Energy replenishment! Get me these items, quickly!|
91495|#823$#Haha! Don't look at me like that - I still know how to enjoy a nice meal!|
91496|Works Well with Others|
91497|#822$#Dad said I should try to recall old memories by interacting more with humans.
#821$#I've always wanted to try fishing - do you think you could teach me?|
91498|#823$#Excellent! If things continue like this, I may someday get my memories back!|
91499|Heartstrings Activated|
91500|#821$#Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#823$#I hope I can someday help Master's dreams come true. As such, I have the following request...|
91501|#821$#Ah, perfect! How did you know these were just the things I wanted?|
91502|Mecha-Memories|
91503|#824$#Since changing to this form, I sometimes fear I'll never get my memories back.
#822$#But don't these key fragments contain part of my soul? Perhaps if I could get that part back, it might help...|
91504|#823$#Well, my memories haven't returned... but I do feel stronger and more powerful! Haha!|
91505|Hoarding with Hel I|
91506|#821$#Lately, I've been keeping an eye out for some shiny, gleaming treasure.
#824$#But however hard I look, I just can't seem to find any...|
91507|#823$#Amazing! Thank you! I've been looking for so long...|
91508|Hoarding with Hel II|
91509|#821$#I have a few items that I cherish above all others.
#824$#But I haven't seen them for several days... do you think they could have been stolen?|
91510|#823$#Ah, thank you! I'm so happy!|
91511|Handmade by Hel I|
91512|#822$#My brother's birthday is coming up, and I'd like to make him something special...
#821$#Perhaps you could give me something to get me inspired?|
91513|#823$#Perfect! Now I know just what to make...|
91514|Handmade by Hel II|
91515|#824$#Hmm... I don't think there's quite enough material...
#821$#Can you help me find a bit more?|
91516|#823$#Thank you so much! I'll be sure to tell my brother we made this together...|
91517|Handmade by Hel III|
91518|#821$#The food's all ready! And with this beautiful dress, I'm nearly ready!
#822$#But I'm still missing just a few things... Can you help me out one more time?|
91519|#823$#Ah, perfect! My brother will be so happy! Haha!|
91520|Hel on Earth|
91521|#821$#What's this thing you used to summon me? Ooh, shiny!|
91522|#823$#Wow! It's so mysterious... Does this mean we're destined to be together?|
91523|Bealdor to the Bone I|
91524|#824$#What? "Bealdor doesn't look so invincible to me"? Who would dare write such a thing!
#821$#Quick, I need help getting a few things! I'm going to teach this loudmouth a lesson!|
91525|#822$#Ah, thank you! What? Did I just want these things for myself? Nonsense! I need them for... reasons!|
91526|Bealdor to the Bone II|
91527|#821$#Next, you'll have to help me prepare some food!
#822$#What? Hungry? Of course not... I... I just need it to prepare for battle!|
91528|#823$#What?! Where did you get this? It looks amazing! This will certainly taste - I mean, help with my training! Yes!|
91529|Lost and Found|
91530|#821$#Whew! Alucard and I had a pretty big fight...
#824$#Now he's looking for something, and he forgot where he put it. Can you help him find it?|
91531|#821$#What? Is this what he was looking for? Aha! Thank you!|
91532|Bealdor's Remorse|
91533|#824$#Hel, Hel... are you still mad at me? I wish I could give you something, but Terra is so big...
#821$#Hey, can you help me out? I made a list of things Hel might like - can you help me find them?|
91534|#821$#Ah, good! Now she's sure to forgive me! What? Of course I'll put your name on the card too!|
91535|Bealdor to the Bone III|
91536|#821$#What? Where'd the letter go? I don't know, I guess I lost it...
#824$#Anyway, who cares? I think you should help me beat whoever wrote it!|
91537|#821$#Huh? Why you... Oh, I'm just kidding. You always know how to cheer me up!|
91538|Bet on Bealdor|
91539|#822$#Traveling with you is pure bliss - well, maybe not PURE bliss, but it's pretty good!
#821$#When I first joined you, I remember feeling like a mysterious power was trailing me...|
91540|#821$#This fragment - it has the same energy I have! So it was the Power of Gaia that brought us together after all.|
91541|Alucard Takes Terra I|
91542|#822$#I've heard of a mysterious skill practiced in Terra... I believe it's referred to as alchemy.
#821$#Could you give me a demonstration?|
91543|#823$#Very mysterious, indeed! And you're mysterious too, if you have skills like that...|
91544|Alucard Takes Terra II|
91545|#821$#Your world is just chock-full of items!
#822$#I find the archaeological ones especially fascinating... Think you could get your hands on some for me?|
91546|#823$#These are the treasures of your realm! Don't worry, I'll keep them safe...|
91547|Alucard Takes Terra III|
91548|#821$#I'm not picky when it comes to eating... but I am very curious about cooking.
#822$#Do you think you could cook something for me?|
91549|#823$#Ah, incredible! You truly are a culinary master!|
91550|All About Azuria|
91551|#822$#My realm seems so different from yours...
#821$#Do you think you could get me some items from your world, for my personal collection? |
91552|#823$#Incredible! You live in a truly abundant realm.|
91553|Alucard, Armed|
91554|#821$#I've heard of legendary battle equipment that can be obtained in Terra...
#822$#I must admit, I find the stories very intriguing!|
91555|#823$#Haha! I wonder whether, someday, someone will name a piece of equipment after me...|
91556|All About Alucard|
91557|#822$#I must say, I've always felt drawn to you by some mysterious power.
#821$#What manner of thing could be causing this...?|
91558|#823$#Aha! Fragments from the Cube of Gaia itself... How fortunate I am to have met you!|
91559|Killer Kusanagi I|
91560|#824$#These demons that claim to be some sort of elite beings...
#821$#I hate the very sight of them! Why wait? Kill them! Kill them now!|
91561|#823$#Wonderful, thank you! Ah, it's so nice and quiet now...|
91562|Killer Kusanagi II|
91563|#821$#You know the key to doing well in battle? Food! The more we eat, the bigger our advantage!
#822$#Hey! What are you waiting for? Get us some food, quickly!|
91564|#823$#Mmm, not bad! Clearly, I was right to entrust you with this task. Haha!|
91565|Killer Kusanagi III|
91566|#824$#How could I forget? It must be because I'm a divine sword... sometimes I forget how important equipment is.
#821$#Come, let's put the equipment into the bag!|
91567|#823$#Haha! Now I'm truly invincible!|
91568|See Reverse for Care I|
91569|#821$#As the world's foremost sword, I must always pay close attention to maintenance.
#822$#In regards to these items, I'm certain you know Terra better than I do. I'll let you take care of this!|
91570|#823$#Perhaps this is what you call "skincare"? No? Well, thank you anyway!|
91571|See Reverse for Care II|
91572|#822$#Haha! Kotonoha explained my mistake from before.
#821$#I won't mess it up this time. These are the items I need - I'm counting on you!|
91573|#821$#So this is applied... where? Can you help?|
91574|A Request from the Best|
91575|#824$#I'm here because you are the chosen one, but there's something else...
#821$#Some mysterious power that draws me to you. What could it be?|
91576|#821$#The Key of Gaia! You truly are the chosen one.|
91577|The Game Is On I|
91578|#827$#Gretel's snacks have been stolen! Somebody here is a thief!
#821$#If my hunch is right, those items should have left traces we can use as evidence.|
91579|#821$#Master, you're a wonderful assistant. Let's see, the evidence shows...|
91580|The Game Is On II|
91581|#822$#We're getting closer to the truth! Who could the thief be?
#821$#The evidence must be carefully assessed...|
91582|#824$#The evidence all leads to one conclusion. The thief is... ME! Oh no, I should apologize to Gretel immediately!|
91583|Gretel's Goodies|
91584|#822$#Brother ate all of Gretel's snacks...
#825$#Every last one. Those were Gretel's favorites...|
91585|#822$#Master, you're the best! But I don't think I'm ready to forgive my brother...|
91586|Sisterly Love|
91587|#825$#Brother's birthday is coming soon! I want to get him something special... especially since I was such a brat last time we spoke...
#822$#Brother's been obsessed with fishing lately, so perhaps some fishing gear? You'll help me, right?|
91588|#822$#You're the best! Brother will love it.|
91589|Brotherly Love|
91590|#824$#Gretel's birthday is coming up, but I think she's still angry with me... What should I do?
#826$#These are Gretel's favorites, but I can't get them by myself...|
91591|#826$#Thanks! She has to forgive me now!|
91592|Gib, Gab, Gossip|
91593|#822$#Ooh, Gretel has some news! Perhaps it can be exchanged for something valuable...
#821$#Let me think... there's always the key that summons my brother and me...|
91594|#822$#The key is fragmented? How ironic. The news is that my brother and I are joining a band!|
91595|Astraea's Life Lessons I|
91596|#821$#I often see gatherings beside the lake... What happens there?
#822$#Fishing? Sounds like fun! Can I try it, too?|
91597|#823$#Haha! If the catch is good, I can cook it up!|
91598|Astraea's Life Lessons II|
91599|#821$#Digging like crazy... for treasure?
#822$#Archaeology... I've heard of it before... Can I try it?|
91600|#823$#Haha! How about you do all the digging? I'd rather not get my hands dirty!|
91601|Astraea's Life Lessons III|
91602|#822$#This weapon and I share a birthdate.
#821$#I've heard that humans are experts at forging things. Perhaps those skills can improve my weapon...|
91603|#823$#That's very helpful. Maybe now I can enhance my Lance and Shield.|
91604|The Finicky Gourmet|
91605|#822$#I'm a picky eater, and I don't really enjoy food all that much.
#821$#That said, would you like to try my cooking?|
91606|#823$#These tools and ingredients don't seem too bad. I'll see how it goes!|
91607|Astraea Suits Up|
91608|#821$#Battle skills? The most important thing is preparation!
#822$#So how about it? Can you get me the proper equipment?|
91609|#823$#Excellent! This equipment is top-notch. It seems you have an eye for quality gear!|
91610|Lead Me Astraea|
91611|#821$#Only those who are true to themselves can understanding the meaning of victory.
#822$#I will demonstrate, if there are fragments of the Key of Gaia.|
91612|#823$#Okay, everything's ready to go! Now, allow me to demonstrate.|
91613|The New Sound I|
91614|#821$#What's wrong? If Master wants to see Cesela's concert,
#822$#simply trade something for tickets!|
91615|#823$#Haha! Thanks, Master! Hmm, tickets? We haven't organized them yet.|
91616|The New Sound II|
91617|#822$#I've got to get Aelius in to see the band!
#821$#Can you help me get these items, Master?|
91618|#823$#Haha! This should be enough to set the traps... Oh! Pretend you didn't hear that, Master!|
91619|The New Sound III|
91620|#821$#Can you help me and my band prepare lunch?
#822$#Haha! This band is really on the road to success!|
91621|#823$#Thanks! You should come see our performance later!|
91622|Material Girl I|
91623|#821$#Master, today Cesela would like a new outfit!
#822$#Preferably with matching accessories. Here's the list...|
91624|#823$#Excellent! You're the best, Master!|
91625|Material Girl II|
91626|#821$#The accessories are great, but Cesela wants a few more items...
#822$#That's it! Let's defeat the monsters and loot this stuff from them!|
91627|#823$#Haha! They're all mine, mine, MINE!|
91628|One in a Million|
91629|#821$#But what does Master think of me?
#824$#Sometimes I fear that Cesela is becoming a carbon copy of Serena...|
91630|#823$#Does Master mean to say that I'm unique? Then give me the whole key, haha!|
91631|Diao Chan's Sudden Idea I|
91632|#822$#Say... since you're such a seasoned world traveler, what do you think is the best material for making a new outfit?
#821$#I'm in the mood for some new jewelry...|
91633|#823$#Eureka! Once refined, this material will make some amazing jewelry!|
91634|Diao Chan's Sudden Idea II|
91635|#2$#I've got the odd feeling that something's missing... Can't you feel it too?
#822$#Yes! Fish scales! I heard that some special scales make amazing jewelry... Do you know anything about them?|
91636|#823$#Wow...! You sure do know what you're doing! If I use these to make some new jewelry... You'd like that, right?|
91637|Diao Chan's Sudden Idea III|
91638|#821$#Next up... these two items! Haha, have you thought of any special combinations?
#822$#Maybe you and I have similar thoughts... I'm counting on you!|
91639|#823$#All dressed up on a sultry night like tonight... Wanna go out, master?|
91640|Diao Chan's Defensive Measures|
91641|#821$#Unlike Astraea, I don't have a shield to protect myself...
#822$#Could you help me find some suitable protective gear, please?|
91642|#823$#Thanks! You're the best! I hope you'll still protect me, though...|
91643|Diao Chan's Divination|
91644|#821$#Hmm... what's the relationship between Alucard and Bealdor? Does Uriel stand a chance of becoming...
#822$#Haha! I'm blessed with the powers of divination, didn't I ever tell you? Say, could you help me find some items?|
91645|#823$#Wow, that was fast! You really wanted to know more about it, huh?|
91646|Diao Chan's Riddle|
91647|#821$#Here's my riddle: There's a special something that not only enhances your abilities, but also makes you catch the eye of other women.
#822$#It could help break the ice between you and me, master. What am I referring to?|
91648|#823$#Ha, you're pretty smart! So, do you want me to give this gift back to you? It's a pretty useful item...|

6237|Party %s1 : %s2|
6238|Death and rebirth exist together

in every battle and every kill.

In the haze of dust and the stench of blood,
you find that balance of life and death in the perfect kill.|
6239|Shadow Assassin

Death waits with baited breath, yearning for a purpose.

Dressed to kill and armed for the slaughter,
she waits for an unsuspecting victim to stumble onto her trap.|
6240|Divine Shield

This shield bears my power and is witness to my glory.

More than just a weapon, it is an extension of myself and my beliefs.
Every mark on my shield represents my sacrifice, my resolve, and my sworn duty.|
6241|Storm Warrior

Evil knows no mercy beneath the clash of thunder and lightning's deadly pierce,

yet evil still spreads like a plague, dragging with it great sorrow.
Emboldened with the might of a thunder god, I am what stands in the way of complete despair.|
6242|The Slow Burn

My rage fuels my power

and my killer instincts are ablaze;
nothing can stop me now.
|
6243|Hand of Vengeance

Seize control, take up your might,

and realize that the beauty of brutality
is that even the most powerful will someday fall.
|
6244|Sun Mage

Light is the spark of all living things.

It has sustained civilizations and shielded the world from everlasting darkness.
It is the source of unparalleled power.
So I say, "Let there be light."|
6245|Elemental Archmage

Elements emerge and disappear,

but they never fade away.
To master this temporal magic is to master an ancient, everlasting power.|
6246|Maverick

Adrift at the edge of the law, on the precipice of life and death,

The fate of my world is like a bullet tearing through the confines of fate.
Your life is in my hands.|
6247|Strategist

There is a certain rhythm to combat,

like a dancer torn between the conflicting beats of emotion and reason.
One is often oblivious to their own demise even while stumbling upon it.|
6248|Destructive Cannon

Just because something is torn asunder does not mean it cannot return back to the way it was.

The most destructive of weapons can also put an end to the most damaging disputes, welcoming peace for a little while.
The cannon roars.|
6249|I-ARMY

An ancient civilization wields advanced technology.

A lost civilization with the key to new wonders has been found.
Meshing together high-tech innovation and ruthless battle strategy,
I-ARMY is prepared to work for YOU towards the path to victory!|
6250|Fiendish Envoy

The purest energy resides in the soul,

within the depths of emotion and the pulse of reason.
Those who unlock the mystery behind the souls holds the power to control these fiends.|
6251|Star Walker

Let me shed this old life from an old world

and walk upon this new world full of wisdom and wonder.
There is nothing I cannot accomplish.|
6252|Phoenix Song

The phoenix, reborn, rises from the ashes of its regrets.

Use the harp to imitate the haunting call of the phoenix and obtain Warm Mist.
Use this to help those in need.|
6253|Temple Bard

Holy light shines upon those

who wield a strong, divine melody.
All regrets are purified to the tune.|
6254|Preacher of Hard Knocks

Worship is done through the fists.

Prayer is done through the perfect swing of a punch.
The battlefield is my church!|
6255|Simmering Emperor

Those who fall before me only build upon the pathway to my success.

I do not remember when I started this journey,
but no one can stop me from finishing it.|
6256|Demonic Wing Scythe

I can hear the taught bow string tremble as I release the arrow.

This is what steadies my focus in combat.
The moment my fingers slip from the bow string, I am at peace, and the very air trembles in fear.|
6257|Frozen Archer

These odd crystals reflect light in a deadly array.

Most do not understand what they see,
and I will use this to my advantage.|
6258|Swift Kaiten Style

My fighting style surges from within me

to produce lightning-quick slashes.
The blade is so fast, it is nearly invisible.
Most enemies do not see it coming.|
6259|Fierce Flash Style

You will hear my blade before you see it, but by then it is too late.

Killing two birds with one stone is my motto.
With speed and precision, all are at the mercy of my blade.|
6260|Nether Realm Acolyte

In the Nether Realm, souls are chained to their torment.

There is no escape, no unity, no identity.
This is true misery.|
6261|Master of Curses

Sticks and stones may break my bones,

but words will definitely kill me.
If pronounced in the correct way, these words can produce power beyond imagining.|
6262|Do you wish to repair the equipped weapon?|
6263|There is nothing to repair.|
