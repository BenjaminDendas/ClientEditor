1|We've been spotted!|
2|Don't let him get away!|
3|You stupid parrot! Come on, tear him apart!|
4|Somebody's broken in!|
5|We're under attack!|
6|You dare to come here?|
7|Wait. You shouldn't be in here!|
8|Who's sneaking around out there?|
9|Who's that?|
10|Who is- Ah! We're under attack!|
11|Who's there? Freeze!|
12|We're under attack, brothers!|
13|How dare you intrude on Catseye Pirate territory!|
14|I'll make sure you can never oppose me again!|
15|Looks like it can't be avoided... Take this!|
16|You think you can stop me? You can go right to hell!|
17|Stop! Stop! We took the girl to the camp! Please, stop!|
18|You have no idea...|
19|I never thought you'd beat me...|
20|Ah! You! Don't move!|
21|Gotcha!|
22|You'll never escape!|
23|You don't belong here, human!|
24|Target identification failed. Commencing attack.|
25|Are you trying to cause trouble?|
26|Like lambs to the slaughter!|
27|Can't you see all of my men? What a fool...|
28|This is our territory! Get out of here!|
29|Look at what you've done!|
30|Don't make trouble!|
31|No! Guards! My robot guards! I need help!|
32|No ID. Preparing to attack.|
33|Useless gnomes! They couldn't even handle a single human!|
34|I won't let you interfere with my master's plan! Die!|
35|I've heard you are quite skilled. Why don't I test you?|
36|Impressive... I yield...|
37|I know exactly what you're looking for!|
38|You're never gonna find it! Hahahaha!|
39|I won't let a brat like you challenge my authority!|
40|Hehehe. Time's up. We've already finished!|
41|What the hell are you doing here?|
42|How'd you get inside?|
43|Don't think you'll be getting out of here alive.|
44|Oh dear. It looks like I have a guest...|
45|How about I send you to heaven?|
46|What are those guards doing? Fine! I'll deal with you myself!|
47|Please don't kill me! I'm not involved!|
48|I'm impressed! Unfortunately, this is as far as you'll go.|
49|Give the crystal back!|
50|Vhell warned you! Guess you must be ready to die!|
51|That human must be his accomplice!|
52|Do you need some - Oh no! Sound the intruder alarm!|
53|Work systems disabled. Battle systems engaged.|
54|I can crush you with one hand!|
55|How could a human... Agh...|
56|I warned you to leave things alone!|
57|I never thought a human would defeat me...|
58|Take this!|
59|I... I'm going to lose?|
60|Hah! Scrap metal thinks it can beat me?|
61|Wait! That's not fair!|
62|I'm-a punch the sense outta you!|
63|No way! Something must be wrong!|
64|Chew it apart, my precious Iron Dragon!|
65|Uh... looks like there're some problems with the hydraulic system. Can we start over?|
66|I suggest you surrender!|
67|What kind of a skill is this? The torque is unbelievable!|
68|I found you, you flimsy hunters!|
69|The Stone Hammer will flatten you!|
70|Get him!|
71|Gotcha! Hahaha!|
72|I'm gonna kill you...|
73|I'm gonna crush you, little bug!|
74|Anyone who challenges the Stone Hammer will die!|
75|I saw you. Don't even try to run!|
76|What are you snooping around for?|
77|Who's there?|
78|An invader! Get him!|
79|Argus Fort doesn't welcome humans!|
80|How dare you set foot on our sacred land!|
81|You presume too much, human. No one is getting out of here alive.|
82|My witchcraft will consume you!|
83|You're going to stay here forever.|
84|Ah! A Human!|
85|You think you can beat me?|
86|We never had any beef with you... Why...|
87|Your soul will belong to the Great Spirit!|
88|No! Give the codex back to me... Give it... back... to me...|
89|Hah! You're really suicidal, you know that?|
90|At least I don't have to go out today...|
91|You're not getting out of here alive!|
92|You'll never get away!|
93|Brothers, let's get him!|
94|You murderer! I'll avenge Tiny!|
95|I... I'll... make you... ugh...|
96|Go to hell!|
97|You think you can escape the King of the Prairie?|
98|Why the hell should I listen to you! Get lost!|
99|Traitor! I'll make you pay!|
100|Bow down, loser!|
101|You think you can get outta here alive?|
102|Dinner is served!|
103|Shred him!|
104|Such a tiny human. It'll be sad to watch you die!|
105|You're gonna regret coming out here!|
106|If you want to pass the trial, you'll have to beat me!|
107|Show me what you can do!|
108|C'mon! Let's fight!|
109|If that's all you've got, you're going to die!|
110|Hah! That was great!|
111|I can barely see you, dwarf!|
112|Aah...|
113|I'll show you our real strength!|
114|Hah... I really underestimated you...|
115|Don't think I'll show mercy!|
116|How could this... agh...|
117|Let's see how easily your ribs break!|
118|How could the weakest of all races defeat me?|
119|I fooooooound you!|
120|Time to die!|
121|Judge me by my height and you'll regret it!|
122|Come on! Let me beat you!|
123|My poison will be the end of you!|
124|Die, just like those Makar!|
125|Let's go!|
126|Don't be afraid, we'll do it together!|
127|Oh man! Come on, help me!|
128|You look like a good test subject...|
129|Protect our leader at all costs!|
130|Is that the best Leo's got?|
131|I won't surrender... I'll conquer the whole world... I'll...|
132|An intruder! Secure the cargo first!|
133|Sorry, but this is a secret. So, now? You've got to die.|
134|Once you're in, you're not coming back out!|
135|Get lost, you stinking human!|
136|Go to hell! Freaking human...|
137|Have you decided how you want to die?|
138|A human is trying to sneak in? Get him!|
139|Target located. Initiating assault.|
140|Target locked. Initiating execution.|
141|Bing! Attack ready.|
142|Special order executed. Eliminate all life.|
143|Annihilation executing. Instructions cancelled. Annihilation executing. Instructions cancelled...|
144|Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!|
145|Target locked. Initiating attack.|
146|I'm not gonna be afraid of you just because you're tall!|
147|Help! Somebody's broken in!|
148|Haha...Yeah! Hahaha!|
149|Hmmm... Hehehehe!|
150|Entering Annihilation Mode. Acquiring target. Initiating execution.|
151|Terminal failure. BSOD. 404 not found.|
152|This technology is beyond anything you've ever seen! I am a genius!|
153|Hang on! Let's talk! No need to get violent!|
154|If you've got any last words, you should say them now!|
155|I am Brian, the uh... Hmmm... ah! The great dictator!|
156|Thank you for being so kind.|
157|Where is my beloved treasure map? WHERE?|
158|I feel weird...|
159|Did you find out you had brain damage?|
160|What? Why won't this stupid bat follow directions?|
161|Kill him, Chief! Kill... I mean, uh. Just beat him.|
162|Psst... Psst...|
163|Psst...|
164|I love you, leader!|
165|Let's go, leader! Let's go!|
166|Our leader is so handsome!|
167|When our leader takes the battlefield, victory is assured!|
168|Our enemies... must die...|
169|I... No... Ah...|
170|You've got guts coming out here and causing trouble!|
171|How... How is this possible...|
172|Fire gives life. Oh, and it takes life too. Hahahaha!|
173|My fire may have been smothered, but the Dark Leader's flames still burn strong...|
174|Even if we're gonna lose, we should keep fighting!|
175|I didn't know there was another treasure map, but it doesn't matter. No one else can have my treasure!|
176|So... Close...|
177|Since you know who I am, I can't let you live. Sorry!|
178|You ended my curse, you stupid human! Now I can have my vengeance!|
179|No! I won't be sealed again!|
180|Agh... That really hurt...|
181|I feel much better now...|
182|Hurry up with the cure! I wanna get up and fight!|
183|Justice... shall... prevail...|
184|Mhm... Looks like you've recovered quite well!|
185|If you've been injured, try to rest! Or you'll take longer to recover.|
186|Holy light, please purify those poor souls who suffer, and free them from their pain.|
187|Princess! Wait for me!|
188|Get outta here!|
189|Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!|
190|Are you ready for my ice and fire curse?|
191|Give me strength!|
192|Darned brat! Guess you'll have to die!|
193|How dare you barge in here! You're not getting out of here alive!|
194|This is a pirate only zone!|
195|Intruders will be killed!|
196|Our progress was already so slow! Gosh darnit!|
197|Don't eat me! Please, please don't eat me!|
198|We need to complete 100 passages this season and we're already so far behind schedule! Argh!|
199|You need more than strength to be a good miner!|
200|You can't see me. Please, please say you can't see me!|
201|One, two, three, four, time to get crystals and ore!|
202|Hm, hm, hm!|
203|For Chibaar!|
204|Are you the one who stole the treasure?|
205|I don't care who you are. Don't bother me!|
206|A thousand curses upon your head!|
207|I'm a member of the legendary crew of the Pirate King.|
208|I'm a member of the legendary crew of the Pirate King.|
209|How dare you come out here and cause trouble!|
210|Are you trying to provoke us?|
211|Coming in here, acting like a big shot... You're gonna pay.|
212|This is our territory!|
213|Another fool who wants to die, eh?|
214|Your money or your... oh who am I kidding. We'll take it all!|
215|Gotta admit. You're kind of pissing us off.|
216|I never thought someone would be dumb enough to walk into this trap.|
217|Time to show our real power!|
218|This desert will be your grave!|
219|You'll be swallowed by the nightmares!|
220|Time for you to feel some fear!|
221|The Fires of Darkness will burn you to ash!|
222|Your soul is MINE.|
223|A thousand- no, a million curses upon you!|
224|These ribs are finger-licking good.|
225|I'll have so much fun with your soul!|
226|Come and learn the meaning of pain!|
227|You'll be one of us soon enough!|
228|Time to die!|
229|Your body will turn to dust!|
230|Your pain is so delightful!|
231|How dare you enter the Kingdom of the Dead!|
232|Anyone intruding on Ozymand Temple will die!|
233|I won't lose to you this time!|
234|One day it'll be you on the ground! Ugh...|
235|How dare you try to stop my master's plans!|
236|Master...|
237|Bow down! This is our leader!|
238|Are you really dumb enough to challenge the regimental leader?|
239|Dad... I'm so sorry...|
240|If you want to leave, you'll need to get by me.|
241|I can't believe I was defeated...|
242|Pi, pi! Don't get hurt!|
243|Pi, pi!|
244|Nobody bullies my friends!|
245|Hrrrrrm!|
246|I'll infect you with our rot!|
247|I'm not broken. Why don't you want me?|
248|Don't run! I'm tasty!|
249|Just give up! The power of decay cannot be beat!|
250|It looks like there are even more this time!|
251|Get out! Your rotten kind isn't welcome here!|
252|Swear your allegiance to Tatiana!|
253|That jerk Micha tried to cheat me? He's dead!|
254|I know... I'll go find Tatiana.|
255|We've been cheated... That filthy Micha!|
256|I'm going to kill him myself!|
257|Why should I listen to you?|
258|Swear to obey Micha!|
259|Caw, caw!|
260|Cawww!|
261|Blasted penguins!|
262|It looks like a pretty simple mechanism.|
263|I made a mistake... This was a lot harder than I thought...|
264|Wonderful! My food came to me!|
265|How could I be defeated by a mere mortal?|
266|All invaders... must die...|
267|Master... I'm... sorry...|
268|You want to try and fight a demon? Let me show you true terror!|
269|No! That's impossible... No way!|
270|Mushrooms? I want some! I want some!|
271|I really want some!|
272|Let me show you how a mage fights!|
273|Squash!|
274|I'm ready to start!|
275|Whoa! What a big mushroom! I want it, I want it, I want it!|
276|I can't eat my favorite mushroom right now...|
277|If you want to live, leave your stuff and go!|
278|You despicable fools!|
279|Help! Stop hurting me!|
280|What do we do? There are so many pirates!|
281|Chief, stop messing around!|
282|I'm so hungry...|
283|Huh? Chief... Victory!|
284|No one can stand against my power!|
285|I was too careless! This one didn't count! Let's try again!|
286|Its hard being so attractive. Don't complain if I cover it up sometimes.|
287|You'll never be able to extinguish the fire in my soul!|
288|You should be bowing before me. Allow me to teach you some manners, fool.|
289|A pack of rebels? I'll show you how your kind ought be treated next time.|
290|Stop wasting my time. I can see through any attack.|
291|Looks like I still need to practice...|
292|Defeat allows one to grow and become stronger. Let me give you that chance!|
293|I will never be defeated! This is only a temporary truce!|
294|Just because I'm an angel doesn't mean I have to be nice!|
295|Man! That was rude! If you think you're going to get into heaven after this, you've got another thing coming!|
296|You must have a death wish, if you challenged me!|
297|No one is gonna take my position.|
298|You'll be begging for death when I'm done.|
299|You cheated! I won't admit defeat!|
300|The wicked must be punished without mercy, if we want to maintain peace.|
301|You only won because I screwed up! You won't get so lucky next time!|
302|I can finally show off my skills! Who wants to die?|
303|Your strength is worthy of note, but don't get overconfident. I let you win.|
304|I hope our purity destroys you!|
305|Stop bullying people! You'll pay if you don't!|
306|Interested in a quick death? Let me help you out!|
307|Impressive! I never expected you to force me to this point!|
308|You want to save somebody? Start with yourself!|
309|This our turf! Get out!|
310|Die!|
311|Don't think that you'll make it out alive!|
312|Kill! Kill! Kill!|
313|I'm invincible!|
314|Oh no! Too strong!|
315|I don't believe it...|
316|So strong!|
317|This isn't possible! How could I lose?|
318|Deplorable! How dare you try to steal my stuff!|
319|How dare you try and cheat me! I'll destroy you!|
320|I want... I want... Vengeance...|
321|I don't think I'll kill you. That won't let you suffer long enough!|
322|I don't believe it...|
323|Aaaaah!|
324|You came here to steal my gems... Now you have to pay!|
325|I'll kill everyone!|
326|A demented bat? Did someone forget to feed it? Is that why it's going crazy?|
327|Reformatting.|
328|Actually... I just want to be a good person.|
329|Who are you? Stop right there!|
330|C'mon! There's someone suspicious over here!|
331|Huh? I've never seen you before... Intruder!|
332|You tried to sneak in here? You'll regret that!|
333|Roar!|
334|Aaaaoooo!|
335|You're the one making the mess, eh? Guess I'll deal with you myself!|
336|Coo, cooo.|
337|Coo, coooo.|
338|Don't be fooled by my appearance! I'm really strong! Seriously!|
339|Be careful! Don't let him interfere with the seal!|
340|It is our duty to maintain the seal. We can't let anyone break it!|
341|Sorry intruder, but you've gotta die.|
342|Protect the seal! Kill them all!|
343|We must obey our master. We can't let anyone through!|
344|How could this... happen...|
345|No... must... follow orders...|
346|Is this... Is this what freedom feels like?|
347|I'm not afraid! You are nothing. NOTHING!|
348|Water can be as destructive as any other element. Let me show you!|
349|Let the cold freeze your blood in your veins!|
350|Fire can warm, fire can burn. Can you guess which I prefer?|
351|Burn! Burn! Burn!|
352|If everything were swallowed by darkness, all conflict would end!|
353|Just give up. Embrace the darkness!|
354|Who disturbs my slumber?|
355|End... Your... Life...|
356|Human! Tasty human! Delicious human!|
357|Let me have a bite!|
358|Humans mean dinner!|
359|Don't run!|
360|I want to eat you!|
361|So strong...|
362|This is terrible... I'm not even full!|
363|How could a human... How could a human beat me?|
364|My life is over...|
365|I... I don't believe it...|
366|Hey! Just because I'm a villager doesn't mean I'm stupid!|
367|Are you trying to steal my herbs?|
368|Hey, villagers know how to fight  too!|
369|You're going to die right here!|
370|What the hell are you doing sneaking around here? Oh well, it doesn't matter. You're gonna die anyway!|
371|We'll leave the darkness, but you will fall into the abyss!|
372|This land is ours... Get out of here!|
373|I can't believe it... Agh...|
374|Don't make me hurt you!|
375|We just wanted... a place... to live...|
376|I wonder how many humans I can crush with one hand!|
377|The beat of the drum gets my heart pumping!|
378|Her blessing will lead us to victory!|
379|These weapons are pretty awesome! We'll get back at those hunters!|
380|We need to improve our border defenses!|
381|All this magic is making me hungry!|
382|Come play with us...|
383|Heehee... I'll play with you next time...|
384|Squeak, squeak.|
385|Glub, glub, glub.|
386|I'm poisonous! Don't eat me!|
387|I don't have much juice...|
388|This is my world! I will consume your dreams!|
389|Delicious, delicious dreams!|
390|Look how full my belly is!|
391|Pop... pop, pop.|
392|The Sea Kingdom is kidnapping people! Get out of here! Hurry!|
393|Gotcha! Don't even think of running!|
394|Tsk, tsk.|
395|Gulp!|
396|It hurts so much... Please, help me!|
397|Ow! I'm not gonna let you off easy now!|
398|Bleh. I still don't feel well. Can you help me?|
399|OWWWWWWWWW! Forget it, I'm just gonna rest!|
400|Beep. Quest blocked. Beginning attack.|
401|Switching to attack mode.|
402|Destroy the enemy. Destroy the enemy...|
403|Target acquired.|
404|Destroy the intruder.|
405|Destroy all obstacles.|
406|Whirrrrrrrr. Beep. Beep.|
407|Beep. Beep. Creak...|
408|How could I lose the experimental materials?|
409|Hahaha! I'll let you live as my slave!|
410|A weakling like you wants to challenge me?|
411|Oh buzz off you annoying little insect.|
412|You look like you're tired of living. Let me help you.|
413|And just when I was thinking I'd never get to cut another head off! You showed up just in time!|
414|It has been a long time since I've taken one of my toys apart!|
415|You've got to last, or I won't have enough time to enjoy it!|
416|Destroy. Eliminate.|
417|Destroy everything.|
418|Enemy detected. Attacking.|
419|Target acquired. Destroying.|
420|Oh! Is this food?|
421|I'm... I'm so hungry I could die!|
422|Ooo! Ahhh!|
423|Ahhh! Hooo! Ahhh!|
424|Die!|
425|I never thought someone like you would beat me...|
426|For the King!|
427|You have the same power as me? That won't stand!|
428|No! I... I... can't...|
429|Someone's broken into the temple! Help! Please help!|
430|You can't stop us!|
431|Find the targets that haven't been authorized yet.|
432|Identify targets. Eliminate invaders.|
433|I will not let you go further! Roar!|
434|I will be your opponent!|
435|You won't be able to stop our plans!|
436|Die you stupid human!|
437|I'm sorry, your highness... I... I couldn't stop the invaders.|
438|Where did you get so much power? Who are you?|
439|Damage has exceeded limitations. Shutting down.|
440|Get... get out of here...|
441|You don't belong here!|
442|Sisters, protect the princess!|
443|You shouldn't have come here.|
444|Target identified as criminal. Arrest order initiated.|
445|You humans are willing to risk your lives so easily!|
446|Ugh... I... At least I killed... a bunch of your people...|
447|Did you summon me just to deal with this pipsqueak?|
448|How... how is this possible?|
449|Anyone else want to try? Let me show you my strength!|
450|Looks like you have a death wish! Let me help!|
451|You must be blind!|
452|I'll take your head, then I'll take the reward!|
453|Argus... why won't you give me... give power...|
454|To the end!|
455|Zaunna will be so proud of me!|
456|My lord, give me power!|
457|You dare to challenge me?|
458|That egg is hatching!|
459|Very brave, entering the lair of fearsome pirates like us!|
460|You and your village should watch themselves.|
461|For my Queen and my people, I will defeat you all!|
462|I... I'm sorry... my queen...|
463|After my transformation, you will know how insignificant you are!|
464|But... but my evolution was perfect...|
465|I will destroy all unsightly mortals!|
466|Release me... from the... chaos...|
467|Life is pain. Let me end your suffering.|
468|To be defeated by a mere mortal...|
469|You are not allowed inside the Wrathborne Temple!|
470|Leave the Wrathborne Temple or face the consequences!|
471|To be defeated by an invader... I am shamed...|
472|If the dead are our enemies, then what chance do we have?|
473|You shouldn't have come here, you fool!|
474|This isn't possible...|
475|Roar! I will kill you!|
476|Blech... urgh...|
477|Don't think you'll escape with your life.|
478|I will kill you and display your remains!|
479|You... you won't get away... with this...|
480|You're such an eyesore.|
481|Intruders must be destroyed...|
482|It... hurts...|
483|Die! Die! Die...|
484|Ack!|
485|...uhhhhhhhhhhhh...|
486|I won't let you through here!|
487|You're... strong...|
488|Let me show you the power I've acquired!|
489|One day you will... you will fall as well...|
490|You will be the first to die!|
491|I've failed...|
492|I'm gonna chop you into tiny bits!|
493|I can't believe I lost.|
494|I'll still be here in a thousand years, while you'll be nothing but dust.|
495|You should not have come here!|
496|Let me show you out!|
497|How could you be so strong...|
498|These treasures belong to us!|
499|You're not getting this treasure!|
500|I... can't believe it...|
501|I... will... crush... you...|
502|We were gonna grind you... into powder...|
503|Uhhh...|
504|Help me kill these monsters!|
505|I have returned, and this time the world will burn with my passing!|
506|I will return...|
507|This new world belongs to me!|
508|Next time... I'll destroy you...|
509|Argh... urgh... you... you got me...|
510|You charlatan! Even if I fall into the abyss, I will claw my way out and find you!|
511|It hurts! It hurts! I won't let you get away with this!|
512|Wow! It doesn't hurt at all! Your healing skills are amazing!|
513|All the pain is gone and I have so much energy!|
514|Thank you for your kindness!|
515|If I'd have known, I wouldn't have come here...|
516|Almost... found... the source...|
517|This treasure came from Tsubaki! You can't take it away from me!|
518|We're not going to lose to a bunch of kids!|
519|Help!|
520|Hahaha! Don't run! Make this easy for me!|
521|Burn little rice cake, burn!|
522|Prepare to be crushed!|
523|Let me lead you to oblivion!|
524|I will find you! There is nowhere in this world or any other where you will be able to hide from me!|
525|I'm an angel! I just want to take you to heaven...|
526|Oh... It looks like I'm going alone...|
527|Let me show you some real pirate power!|
528|Selena belongs to me! She isn't going anywhere!|
529|You want to be my new prey?|
530|How could I lose to you? I am the greatest hunter to have ever lived!|
531|Don't interrupt my prayers, you fool!|
532|It looks like I need to train more...|
533|You're a fool if you think you're getting my treasure!|
534|You'll get yours!|
535|Stay away! You're going to ruin my clothes!|
536|Ow, ow, ow, ow! That hurts!|
537|Oh blast! Enemies!|
538|Hurry and bring them back!|
539|I feel numb... I don't have any energy left...|
540|Serena will punish you for your greed!|
541|I won't give up so easily next time!|
542|Get that fuel to the gate!|
543|You're in the way!|
544|Let me show you how romantic a man can be!|
545|My empire...|
546|The dice say we should play!|
547|I'll win next time!|
548|Go! Go!|
549|Hah! So much fun!|
550|Run for your lives! The Humans have arrived!|
551|Help! Help! They're gonna eat me!|
552|Hang in there, Nelly! Don't give in to the Humans!|
553|Humans are so horrible! Please get rid of them, Nelly!|
554|How about we have some fun in your dreams?|
555|Hmph! I'll have more time to play next time!|
556|So annoying!|
557|So annoying!|
558|So annoying!|
559|So annoying!|
560|So annoying!|
561|So annoying!|
562|Show me the fish if you want to live!|
563|Quack-quack... quack-quack....|
564|Sit back, relax, and enjoy the soothing dance of the fish....|
565|What a rude person... quack!|
566|The world is in such great peril! It is more than Uncle Ben can take!|
567|Even though Uncle Ben is slain, the souls of our fallen - quack! - will not be forgotten!|
568|Haha! You've just been outsmarted by the Varan Bandits!|
569|You dare challenge us, pipsqueak? You must have a death wish!|
570|Heh! Looks like today will be a fruitful day!|
571|Taste this hot flame!|
572|That was amazing! I'm convinced!|
573|Uhh... Uhh... Uhh...|
574|Quack! Quack! Quack!|
575|For Lord Daq...|
576|Long live the Darkness!|
577|Thank you.|
578|Give yourselves to the Darkness!|
579|Submit to my Dark Power!|
580|Fear my ferocious snowstorm!|
581|Hmph! Next time I'll show you a more powerful dance!|
582|This world will be mine! Surrender to me!|
583|Is it time yet?|
584|My beginning... will be your end...|
585|Change... cannot be stopped...|
586|I will create... a new world...|
587|I will find a new home for my people. I swear!|
588|Come! Let me taste your blood!|
589|This world... it is filled with wonders!|
590|Show me your strength, guardian.|
591|Impressive... I yield...|
592|Dimensional Travel Mode terminated. Entering Combat Mode.|
593|Engine failure detected. Terminating mission. Initiating self-destruct.|
594|Destroy! Burn!|
595|I will return!|
596|This sea... it will be my new home!|
597|I'll return when... when I'm ready...|
598|You want me to stop?|
599|Ugh... I was careless...|
600|Current location unknown. Hostile targets identified. Prepare for battle.|
601|System overload. Shutting down.|
602|My world is gone. Yours, though. Yours will soon be mine.|
603|Impossible! My technology has no equal!|
604|This place looks fun!|
605|What could be inside? This is so exciting!|
606|Haha!|
607|Filthy Human! Leave my people be!|
608|You are alone? Then taste my axe!|
609|You are too confident! Die for your arrogance!|
610|This is a favor from the Charm Queen!|
611|Accept this great, dark power...|
612|What do you hope to prevent?|
613|Do you know the enemy that you're facing?|
614|Entry is forbidden!|
615|Intruder! It is time for you to disappear!|
616|Yes ma'am... I mean, my Queen!|
617|Purge those who would interfere with us!|
618|Queen...|
619|Atta... Attack...|
620|What are you trying to do?|
621|Don't get in our way!|
622|Ah! Thief! Thief!|
623|Not here! Not here! Not here!|
624|I'm so strong now!|
625|How dare you burst in here!|
626|Quit disturbing the peace!|
627|Insufferable sorcery!|
628|I'll curse you!|
629|Can't... go... in...|
630|You're going to be my first victim!|
631|How dare you attack me!|
632|Squeak, squeak.|
633|Go to hell! Humans!|
634|Don't get in my way!|
635|Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!|
636|Ambush|
637|Come and fight, humans!|
638|Is that all your kind can do?|
639|Taste my power!|
640|Stop resisting, fool humans!|
641|Trying to take my things? You want to die that badly?|
642|Protect the supply cart!|
643|Impudent whelps! I'll eat all of you!|
644|Wow! You smell delicious!|
645|Give them your worst!|
646|For the Church!|
647|Charge!|
648|Damn you, you blasted humans!|
649|Fire! Help!|
650|How did it catch on fire? If the commander finds out, we're in serious trouble! How did the fire get so big? Quick, put it out!|
651|How dare a mere human mess with me!|
652|Damn! I'll slice you to pieces!|
653|Even if I disappeared, the troops of Eldador would still be there.|
654|If the Immemorial Beast doesn't grow up, none of you will!|
655|Who are you? You are not allowed in the restricted area.|
656|Eat the intruders!|
657|Watch out!|
658|Be careful - I won't pull any punches!|
659|You can't run... Did you eat too much?|
660|You're trying to steal snacks we won't eat? Despicable!|
661|The food's here, and it just so happens that I'm famished!|
662|The Windsoul Grass is ours!|
663|Protect the Immemorial Beast Egg!|
664|Food... don't be so arrogant!|
665|Just you wait... You'll pay for this!|
666|Don't even think about trying to get past me.|
667|I won't let you get close to the king.|
668|Behold the strength of the Marauders!|
669|How... how is this possible?|
670|Impossible... how could a human be so strong?|
671|I can't believe... I was defeated by a human...|
672|Oh...|
673|Aahhhh...|
674|You shall pay a blood price for disturbing the dead!|
675|Allow me to remove all that burdensome flesh!|
676|Death... is only the beginning...|
677|Where are you? I can hear you breathing!|
678|My body feels so light!|
679|What stupid little creatures humans are...|
680|Vermin! Beg for your lives!|
681|How can this be?|
682|It's a little too quiet...|
683|My hunger is not yet satisfied...|
684|Ancestors, lend me your power!|
685|Your soul is mine!|
686|I shall join my ancestors in eternity...|
687|You're nothing but flies to me...|
688|I need to find a time to get a new staff.|
689|I'll cut you in half!|
690|Fight to the death...|
691|Go back... to sleep...|
692|Who tampered with my right leg? It doesn't feel right.|
693|I was a renowned hero, but then one day an arrow shattered my knee...|
694|I'll dine on your entrails!|
695|Prepare to meet your doom!|
696|This is the end...|
697|It always feels like I've forgotten something...|
698|I've been feeling pretty useless lately...|
699|No one can resist this demonic power!|
700|Die, puny human!|
701|Darkness will cover the earth... My only regret is that I won't be there to see it...|
702|If I flap my wings faster, will I fly higher?|
703|Are you sure you're allowed to pick wild flowers growing next to the road?|
704|Get out of Titan's Root...|
705|Damn! The mushrooms have been damaged.|
706|The mushrooms are dead...|
707|I'll crush you like ants!|
708|Let me put you out of your misery!|
709|For the Duke!|
710|You cannot stop the darkness!|
711|Duke, please forgive me...|
712|For the Queen!|
713|All who dare to defy the Queen shall die!|
714|I've failed...|
715|Who I am is of no importance. What's important is that I want to rule the world!|
716|Ooh la la...|
717|I will become the ruler of your world! Even the waves will obey my every whim!|
718|...isn't it time yet?|
719|You arrived just in time! My joints are getting rusty already!|
720|Blast it! I was so close to winning...|
721|It's war! Kill!|
722|Become one of us!|
723|Smash!|
724|The weak are destined to fail!|
725|Losers must accept their fate!|
726|Now, behave yourself and become fodder for it!|
727|The weak don't deserve to survive!|
728|Die!|
729|Hand over your life!|
730|I'll rip you to shreds!|
731|Heehee, I'll pull out your bones!|
732|Heehee, I'll tear off your skin!|
733|Blood! I want your blood!|
734|Flesh! I want your flesh!|
735|Destruction...|
736|Sacrifice your soul!|
737|Hate... I hate it...|
738|I can't remember... why I am here...?|
739|Did... did I die again...?|
740|Ha! You dare challenge me?|
741|It seems you crave death!|
742|No! I... don't... want to die...|
743|Human! Leave... this place!|
744|Biggof wants... to grind... you into meat!|
745|Biggof wants... to rest...|
758|You are not prepared!|
759|I... lost? Inconceivable!|
760|No one can stand against the great leviathan of the seas!|
761|I have given... my very best...|
762|My powers transcend time and space!|
763|No one can defeat me!|
764|My... my undefeated record...|
765|You are nothing compared to me!|
766|I will definitely win... next time....|
767|Sword in the Stone! Grant me the strength to forge ahead!|
768|The chivalry of the knights... shall last forever...|
769|Are you strong enough to meet me in combat?|
770|My shield... Is it shattered?|
772|Are you ready to face my Ninjutsu?|
776|Hmm? And just where did all these naughty children come from, I wonder? I, the Dark Moon Rabbit, shall punish you!|
777|Ahh-! My m-... music lessons are about to begin. I'll have to teach you a lesson next time! I won't forget this!|
2001|My fist has something to say about your future!|
2002|Why should we bother helping humans?|
2003|I really want your eyes. Literally. In a jar.|
2004|Do you think you can handle this beating?|
2005|How are you still standing? Argh!|
2006|You don't seem to be thinking straight. Maybe crushing your head will help!|
2007|Jealous? You should be!|
2008|Stop fighting back! This is getting irritating!|
2009|You put up a good fight, but that's it! I'm done messing around!|
2010|Let me reward your efforts... with DEATH!|
2011|Attack!|
2012|Worthless barrier!|
2013|Hahaha! It's useless!|
2014|I'm getting serious now!|
2015|How is this possible? I'll kill you!|
2016|Attack!|
2017|Worthless barrier!|
2018|Initiating Absolute Defense!|
2019|You're starting to annoy me!|
2020|Come on! Let's fight to the death!|
2021|One bite will get me through your armor!|
2022|De-fense! De-fense!|
2023|Worthless barrier!|
2024|Attack!|
2025|You can't lose! Don't give up!|
2026|Attack the target!|
2027|Remove the barrier!|
2028|Activate the Absolute Barrier!|
2029|Heh. You've made a lot of progress.|
2030|No! I'm going to be the champ!|
2031|All who oppose the Shadow Knight deserve death!|
2032|Let this demonic wind end you!|
2033|Annihilation...|
2034|I'll make you... I'll make you vanish...|
2035|I will turn you to ash!|
2036|When I finish, there will be nothing left of you!|
2037|Even the lightning obeys me!|
2038|Struggle to survive! I want to see it!|
2039|So tiny!|
2040|I want all living things to be corrupted!|
2041|Become like us!|
2042|Check my Axe of the Deep out!|
2043|Isn't my Spiral Slash stylish?|
2044|Get out of here, all of you!|
2045|Die beneath my feet!|
2046|Die!|
2047|Purple Slash!|
2048|Axe Dance!|
2049|Drunken Slash!|
2050|Come and join me in death...|
2051|Flurry of Jabs!|
2052|DEF|
2053|Take this!|
2054|I, Granby, will show you what I'm really made of.|
2055|Sinby will defeat you!|
2056|Come on! Darby shall find a way to win!|
2057|Take that, foolish Envoy of Gaia!|
2058|Be a good boy and heed my advice. Your best bet is to just surrender!|
2059|I have incomparably outstanding skills!|
2060|Even without my sword, I will still win!|
2061|I fight for my own glory!|
2062|Today's toy is a little tough to deal with...|
2063|Yar! Let's go!|
2064|My Robotic Sheriff will destroy you.|
2065|Bring it on, my friend. I will let you be the first to experience my newest armor.|
2066|May this battle be blessed by the God of War...|
2067|God of War, give me strength!|
2068|I will prove to you that military might is everything!|
2069|I will show you what the Giants Tribe is really made of!|
2070|This is for... You know what, never mind! This is for me!|
2071|This is for the Stone Hammer Tribe!|
2072|Darn... I cannot believe that Granby lost... I'm so annoyed...|
2073|S...Sinby is here to admit that he has lost...|
2074|Ah... Darby hurts...|
2075|Looks like I am really getting old...|
2076|I should have paid more attention... I had no way to win...|
2077|I just fell asleep... You should take that as a generous boon and take the lead for a moment!|
2078|If I'd had my sword, I wouldn't have lost!|
2079|Meeting a warrior like you is a once in a lifetime opportunity...|
2080|I can't believe this defeat...|
2081|A Human won? How...?|
2082|That's why you're the champion... You are really something.|
2083|Haha... Beaten again! You really are amazing!|
2084|What a marvelous battle...|
2085|The God of War has not blessed me today...|
2086|You deserve my respect, Envoy of Gaia.|
2087|This Human is amazing!|
2088|Oh... It hurts...|
2089|What a great battle! I admit defeat!|
3001|Tell me a story, Grandpa!|
3002|Of course! This is a story about the White Boot Princess. Once upon a time... No, wait...|
3003|Well... Hm... Uh... How does it start?|
3004|I don't know! That's why I asked you, Grandpa!|
3005|Well, Grandpa doesn't remember either! Why don't I tell you about the big bad wolf instead?|
3006|I don't want to hear about smelly wolves, Grandpa!|
3007|Hello! How much for an apple?|
3008|You've got great taste! These apples are the best around! 50 gold for one! It is worth every bit!|
3009|Bull! This quality is worth 5 gold, at best!|
3010|That's nowhere near what it's worth! I'll give cut you a deal though: 49 gold!|
3011|How about I tell your wife about how I saw you getting cozy with that cute bartender last night?|
3012|Shhh! Fine! Fine! Just take a stupid apple!|
3013|Wow, that new merchant is so hot!|
3014|Ah! He's smiling right at me! I'm so embarrassed!|
3015|You should be. Besides, he's looking at me!|
3016|What? No. He's definitely looking at me! Why would he even bother looking at you?|
3017|Both of you just shut up! He's not even looking over here!|
3018|That doesn't matter anymore. Which of us is prettier? Me or her?|
3019|Yeah. Which of us is cuter?|
3020|I, uh... I gotta use the bathroom. Be right back!|
3021|Oh, Romeo! Romeo! My handsome and gentle Romeo!|
3022|Ah, Juliet! Juliet! My beautiful and graceful Juliet.|
3023|Romeo, honey, do you love me or love me not?|
3024|Juliet, dear, I love you and I love you more!|
3025|What a wonderful day! I love resting under the trees!|
3026|How dare you relax while we're all working! How much are you getting paid to loaf about?|
3027|Uh... 100 gold?|
3028|Fine. This is your last 100 gold, then! Now get lost and never come back!|
3029|Sure!|
3030|Hah! A free 100 gold! Hahaha!|
3031|Hey! What was that kid's job? Why were you letting him slack off like that?|
3032|Uh... he doesn't work for us. He just delivers fertilizer in the morning. Why should I care what he does after?|
3033|...|
3034|One mushroom, two mushrooms, three mushrooms... Whoa! So many mushrooms! Definitely enough for dinner!|
3035|Ouch! This grass is really slippery!|
3036|Oh no! I dropped all the mushrooms! Noooo!|
3037|What color were the mushrooms you dropped, little lady?|
3038|Huh? Who said that? Oh no! Have the Catseye Pirates found me?|
3039|But uh... the mushrooms I got weren't red or white.|
3040|You are quite an honest child! Here, take these dried mushrooms as a reward!|
3041|Wait! You can talk, Mr. Mushroom?|
3042|Also, these are way more mushrooms than I picked!|
3043|I'm the god of mushrooms! This is nothing at all! You were lucky to run into me!|
3044|You're so nice! And these mushrooms are going to be delicious!|
3045|What do pirates want? Money! Food! Men!|
3046|Er... boss? Ain't that supposed to be women?|
3047|Stupid kid! What would a brotherhood like us need with women? What we need is more men!|
3048|You're right! You're a genius! I'll follow you for life, boss!|
3049|I'll never leave you, boss!|
3050|Boss! We love you!|
3051|Look, Mom! I found a cricket!|
3052|Honey, let him go! If you don't, his mom is going to be devastated!|
3053|Don't worry Mom, I'll catch them all! Then they can be together!|
3054|...|
3055|Dad, if I can win the fruit picking contest at the orchard, will you be happy?|
3056|Dad will be thrilled!|
3057|Don't worry, Dad. I won't let you down!|
3058|...|
3059|Come any closer and I'll scream!|
3060|Scream all you want! Nobody is gonna help you!|
3061|Help! Help! Help!|
3062|So old fashioned. I do believe I've lost interest.|
3063|Check out this fish I just caught! We should roast it!|
3064|No! You come here every single day and make me roast fish with you! Just thinking about doing it again is making my stomach hurt!|
3065|What's wrong with roast fish?|
3066|There are other ways to eat it, you know!|
3067|There are other ways to cook fish? Like what?|
3068|I love watching the waves...|
3069|They are beautiful, aren't they?|
3070|How much for this green vegetable?|
3071|81,000 gold!|
3072|Seriously? You might as well be robbing me!|
3073|I feel like my hair is falling out! What am I gonna do if I go bald?|
3074|Oh relax. You may be losing the hair on your head, but you've got plenty left everywhere else on your body.|
3075|You are not helping!|
3076|Seriously, relax or you're gonna lose even more hair.|
3077|Maybe I should consider some sort of hair growth tonic...|
3078|If you do that, you're going to become an animal!|
3079|Shut up! I don't care! I just want a beautiful head of hair!|
3080|You know, some women really dig bald guys. Just use what you've got.|
3081|Do you mean it? Really? You're such a wonderful friend!|
3082|This little village has nothing going for it, Romeo! I want to see the whole wide world!|
3083|Oh, Juliet! We'll go wherever you want to go!|
3084|Romeo, you're so wonderful! I love you so much!|
3085|Juliet, you're so amazing! I love you even more!|
3086|Romeo!|
3087|Juliet!|
3088|It is so dark and windy out there. Is Dad coming back soon?|
3089|He should be back soon! He just wanted to catch a big fish!|
3090|Are you going to have some of it? If you keep eating so much, you're gonna get fat!|
3091|Oh, you'll pay for that!|
3092|Ow, ow! You're too scary, sis! I'll stop, I'll stop!|
3093|You're not a kid anymore! You're going to try steamed fish and you are going to love it!|
3094|I can't thank you enough! I'm really lucky to have a neighbor like you!|
3095|Considering the effort we went through to get these, we can't lower the price.|
3096|Fine! Who cares! I'll go buy from another shop instead!|
3097|Hey, you! Quit being lazy and get to work! Chop some wood or you won't be getting any dinner! Now get to it!|
3098|I hate chopping wood, though! Come on, give me another job! Anything!|
3099|It feels like something bit my finger...|
3100|Oh gods, bugs! Get them away from me!|
3101|Hayla must have wanted me to make a fool of myself, telling me to check out these beautiful flowers! They're full of bugs, and he knows I hate bugs!|
3102|I baked some delicious cookies for you!|
3103|I'm just a poor old woman! Please, make sure this child gets back safely.|
3104|Oh no! I heard the village chief's son has disappeared! I hope he's safe!|
3105|I must note this place's beauty in my travel log!|
3106|I don't know how I'll be able to face my daughters if I go back like this. I need a plan.|

3112|It is so beautiful here! The flowers smell so lovely!|
3113|I've finally gotten to see the sea, and it is even more beautiful than I expected! It's enough to make a man cry!|
3114|Come buy my vegetables! The man over there is a crook! His vegetables are rotten and probably stolen!|
3115|Mwahaha! Mwahahahahaha!|
3116|I've got a feeling I'm gonna catch some big fish today!|
3117|This kid is so well-behaved. I'll admit it: I'm gonna miss him when he's gone.|
3118|I'm going to pick even more flowers to decorate with!|
3119|There aren't enough words to describe how excited I am!|
3120|These vegetables are super tasty! Come on! Check out how fresh they are!|
3121|These logs are so hard! I'm getting completely worn out!|
3122|Ugh! Where'd my fishing rod go? I could have sworn I had it a moment ago.|
3123|I'm telling you, there was a ghost out back last night!|
3124|Really? What did it look like?|
3125|It had evil red eyes! And sharp teeth! And... and... you know. It looked a lot like you, now that I think about it.|
3126|You're such a jerk! Why don't you go die and become a ghost yourself!|
3127|Here's some food! Eat up and get stronger!|
3128|Drink the water, drink the water, drink some more, then give us milk!|
3129|I'm speechless. You really sang all that.|
3130|You're all too noisy! Stop singing and focus on your work!|
3131|I'd like 10 bunches of bananas, please.|
3132|That's weird. I thought you didn't eat bananas. Why do you want so many, all of a sudden?|
3133|Because the Crescent Ceremony is almost here, and I need fruit!|
3134|Why?|
3135|Because all of Lunarin is going to attend the ceremony! If I sold some fruit during it, I bet I'd make a mint!|
3136|You... do know they'll be too ripe by the festival though, right?|
3137|...oh, blast! I forgot about that!|
3138|Our flower field is so beautiful! People come from all over the world to see it!|
3139|Those flowers are so graceful, yet, at the same time, so sad. They are a true work of art.|
3140|Our landscape is the most beautiful on the continent! What do you think, Mr. Traveler?|
3141|I'm not a traveler. I'm just a sad, sad poet.|
3142|Well, Mr. Poet, I bet this flower field will cheer you right up! Take some time to enjoy it, okay?|
3143|Ah! Where's my Papa? Where is he?|
3144|What's wrong? Daddy's here!|
3145|There are worms on these vegetables! It's so gross! We can't eat them anymore!|
3146|Don't be silly! Worms are trying to eat our vegetables because of how tasty and good they are. Just wash them off and everything will be fine.|
3147|But I heard that if you eat a vegetable with a worm on it, you'll become a worm!|
3148|Well, if it happens to you, it'll happen to me too! We'll be worms together, so don't worry!|
3149|Oh, Juliet! These flowers have nothing on your beauty!|
3150|Oh, Romeo! Do you mean it? Does my beauty really surpass them?|
3151|Yes, Juliet! There is no wonder in this world that can compare to your beauty.|
3152|Oh, Romeo! You are such a romantic!|
3153|Of course, Juliet! You deserve nothing less!|
3154|I love you, Romeo!|
3155|I love you too, Juliet!|
3156|Heya. I'm Holly. What's your name?|
3157|Cass.|
3158|Well, Cass...|
3159|Would you like to go to the ceremony with me?|
3160|Oh! I was going to ask you!|
3161|Of course I'll go with you!|
3162|Great. It's a date then!|
3163|Temporarily blank|
3164|Look at those cute flowers, brother!|
3165|They're cute! We should pick them!|
3166|They're too lovely! It would be a crime to pick them.|
3167|But you'd be the envy of everyone at the ceremony!|
3168|I don't want to kill the flowers, though.|
3169|You really are too kind. If I were you, I'd pick the lot of them.|
3170|Just leave them alone, okay?|
3171|I wish everyone was as nice as you.|
3172|Repeat after me: The early bird catches the worm, but the early worm gets caught by the bird!|
3173|The early bird catches the worm, but the early worm gets caught by the bird.|
3174|Teacher, I have a question!|
3175|That's good of you to raise your hand when you have a question, Millia!|
3176|Do we have to be birds or worms? I don't want to eat worms, but I don't want to get eaten by birds!|
3177|We're not being literal! It is just an expression to teach good habits!|
3178|I really want to change the way I look.|
3179|What do you want to change?|
3180|My skin tone.|
3181|But you're already so beautiful!|
3182|I know, but sometimes you just want a change. I want green skin, just like a fairy!|
3183|...I have never heard anyone ask for that. Ever. I wouldn't even know how to help.|
3184|Well, maybe the Fairies eat grass? So if we use grass, my skin will turn green! Logic!|
3185|Well, I guess we can try that...|
3186|Is it possible to fix this machine?|
3187|Well, I have worked on over a thousand machines.|
3188|Well, if you can manage this, then you really are a legendary craftsman!|
3189|Hopefully this one doesn't explode after I finish with it!|
3190|What do you mean "doesn't explode?"|
3191|Nothing, nothing! All my repairs work perfectly well and never revert or explode unexpectedly.|
3192|You know, I think maybe I'll try and fix it myself first.|
3193|Well, I've gotta say. That painting looks great!|
3194|So uh... is this painting finished? Because I don't seem to be in it.|
3195|Huh? Well, uh, I definitely asked for both of us to be in it. Oh well. Too bad, guess we just have this wonderful portrait of me!|
3196|This picture isn't at all what I wanted. We only have one choice: let's burn it!|
3197|No, my beautiful portrait!|
3198|Wow. I didn't know Montero would be able to make such an amazing robot.|
3199|He is! I want to become as great a mechanist as Montero.|
3200|That's a great dream! So, do you think Montero will be the champ this time?|
3201|I bet you 20 candies that he's gonna win!|
3202|Let's go to the match, then! I'll enjoy eating your candy!|
3203|Pfft! You won't be having any of my candy!|
3204|If you want to design the perfect robot, you must have excellent mathematical abilities. How about a test?|
3205|What's 1+1?|
3206|Uh... 2?|
3207|How about 1+1+1?|
3208|Uh... 3?|
3209|How about 1+1+1+1+1+1?|
3210|You... are kidding, right?|
3211|This is the power of solidarity!|
3212|I have so much left to learn.|
3213|Sigh. I feel so old and useless these days. A couple of stairs are enough to make my old knees ache.|
3214|Have you thought about using a cane?|
3215|A cane? That would be so ugly.|
3216|Why do you care about looking pretty? You're too old for it to matter.|
3217|That's enough out of you! Just help me out!|
3218|Fine, fine. Sheesh.|
3219|You've got some serious bags under your eyes.|
3220|I haven't been sleeping well lately.|
3221|That's a shame. How come?|
3222|One of my neighbors is always working on something super noisy in the middle of the night.|
3223|Oh. Uh. That would be my fault. I didn't realize I was so loud. Sorry.|
3224|Meditation is the key to knowledge. Let's go study under a waterfall!|
3225|Great idea! Let's do it together! On three!|
3226|One, two...|
3227|Stop! Don't push me, big brother!|
3228|I'm so scared! I'm gonna fall! I'm gonna fall!|
3229|Just go!|
3230|Help!|
3231|There shouldn't be anyone around...|
3232|Let's see if we can find something worth taking.|
3233|Eh? What is this thing? It looks kind of like a gear, but these markings... I wonder if this is valuable...|
3234|Who cares. Let's bring it back with us! It could be treasure!|
3235|They say that if you make a wish at a rainbow in front of Rarnor Falls, it will come true.|
3236|That sounds like it'd be worth trying. What's your wish?|
3237|Well, it is supposed to be a secret, but I guess I can tell you if you promise to keep quiet.|
3238|I will.|
3239|My wish will be... getting another wish!|
3240|Another wish?|
3241|Yeah, and then I can wish for another wish. And then I can wish for another, and then another, and then another... I'll have all the wishes in no time!|
3242|...right.|
3243|Oh, Juliet, this waterfall will flow forever. Just like our love!|
3244|And the beautiful rainbow it makes is just like our love too! Beautiful and colorful!|
3245|Juliet, will you marry me?|
3246|I- wait, what kind of proposal is that? No diamond, no flowers... You're not even kneeling! I refuse!|
3247|Forgive me, Juliet! My next proposal will be perfect!|
3248|I'd love to retire here.|
3249|Back when I was young, I was a miner out here.|
3250|A shame all the mines have been taken over by those Marauders.|
3251|There aren't any young people left in the village. This place is dying...|
3252|I'm telling you, bro. There's a secret path with some sort of ore along it!|
3253|Really? Show me! It could be the legendary and super valuable Crystal Ore!|
3254|You mean we could sell it and get medicine for grandma?|
3255|That's right! Let's go find it as soon as we can!|
3256|Close your eyes, dear Juliet.|
3257|What are you going to do, beloved Romeo?|
3258|Okay, open them!|
3259|Wow! Such a beautiful gem. Is this for me?|
3260|Yes, my love! I found this gem and thought that, though it paled in comparison to your beauty, it should be yours.|
3261|Oh, Romeo, you are the best!|
3262|Oh, Juliet!|
3263|Hello, hello! Would you like to try our Ecstasy Fruit? It is a fruit whose taste is beyond compare!|
3264|Come on, just try one! I guarantee you'll love it!|
3265|Oh wow! This fruit is so good! Oh! There aren't even words!|
3266|Noooo... why'd you let me try it? I'll never have the chance to taste such wonders again! What am I going to do? Ahhh!|
3267|Ah, such a nice day! I think I'll skip work!|
3268|If you're not working, what are me and the kids supposed to do?|
3269|Come on! I need a break every once in a while!|
3270|Dad, I'm hungry!|
3271|I'm hungry!|
3272|So hungry!|
3273|Dad... Boo-hoo...|
3274|Dad... Boo-hoo...|
3275|Dad... Boo-hoo...|
3276|Fine! Fine! I'm headed back to work! Sheesh!|
3277|I've heard that drinking from the Demarech Pool will transform you into a true beauty.|
3278|Seriously? I need to try it!|
3279|Gulp!|
3280|How's that? Am I prettier than before?|
3281|Not really. Guess the rumor wasn't true.|
3282|...|
3283|Those Marauders have ruined everything...|
3284|A few years ago I came here with a cart full of treasure, hoping to collect a lifetime supply of Ecstasy Fruit!|
3285|It was going great, right up until the Marauders took everything!|
3286|I've got nothing left now! How can I face my family now?|
3287|Doctor! This ore seem to be radiating some sort of strange energy. This might be worth looking into!|
3288|Could this be what I've been looking for?|
3289|Hurry! Let's gather some and send it to the lab!|
3290|Right, Professor!|
3291|Hurry up, everyone! Let's get as much of that ore as we can. Make sure you don't break it!|
3292|Yes!|
3293|Right, Marcy.|
3294|Of course.|
3295|Who do you think you are? This place belongs to our boss, Kate! You're not allowed to pick fruits, pick up stones, play hide and seek, or anything else!|
3296|Nonsense! This place belongs to our boss, Jessie! You can't pick fruits, pick up stones, or any of that other stuff!|
3297|Well I'm gonna kick your butt!|
3298|Yeah? You try it!|
3299|Look at my scary face!|
3300|Pft! That's nothing! I won't be scared!|
3301|You remind me of the babe.|
3302|What babe?|
3303|The babe with the power.|
3304|What power?|
3305|The power of voodoo.|
3306|Who do?|
3307|You do!|
3308|Do what?|
3309|Remind me of the babe!|
3310|It IS you! That's crazy! If I get wrinkles, it is on your head!|
3311|What a pain.|
3312|What happened?|
3313|Stupid dust storm. I put some clothes out to dry and now they're covered in dirt!|
3314|No problem! I know how to take care of that sort of problem!|
3315|Really? Please teach me how to deal with it!|
3316|Okay, are you ready for this? Just shake the dust off them!|
3317|What a bold technique! I'm going to try it!|
3318|I really need to eat some fresh fruit... cough, hack...|
3319|I'm sorry, but we can't afford any, Grandpa.|
3320|But the doctor said I need to eat fresh fruit to deal with my illness... cough, hack...|
3321|I apologize for eavesdropping, but here, please take this money.|
3322|No! We don't know you! We can't accept a handout like this!|
3323|Forget your pride. I'm a doctor. It hurts me to see your grandfather suffer like this. So please, take it.|
3324|You're a good person... cough, hack... thank you.|
3325|Did you know that the heroic Jones brothers live here?|
3326|I did! Tanner is so dreamy...|
3327|Tanner is fine, but Roger is the real stud. So mature and collected...|
3328|But Tanner is so majestic while they hunt! It's enough to make me forget to breathe while I watch him!|
3329|You're right! They are both amazing! I'm glad no one has claimed their hearts yet!|
3330|I'm going to leave this stupid, sand-filled place soon.|
3331|Why would you want to leave? This is your home.|
3332|Because I don't want to be here anymore! Duh.|
3333|What am I supposed to do? How am I going to fend for myself?|
3334|Why don't you come with me?|
3335|Well... I guess I could do that.|
3336|You should make something cool with the sand.|
3337|We should have a contest to see who can make the coolest sand thing!|
3338|There's no chance you could beat me. It'd be unfair!|
3339|You're just afraid I'd kick your butt!|
3340|Well, if you really want to compete with me...|
3341|Yeah! I'm gonna show you who's boss!|
3342|If you think so!|
3343|Look at this trophy!|
3344|Not to be rude, but... why are your trophies always meat and not, like, antlers or something like that?|
3345|Because meat is the best proof! A good hunt tastes good! I've made some of it into jerky. Why don't you try it?|
3346|Ewww! Why does this meat taste like dirt?|
3347|Bah. You have no taste.|
3348|Is this really where the tattered map leads? Because all these corpses are kind of scary.|
3349|Do you think they have something to do with the ruins?|
3350|It doesn't really matter, I guess. We've got to beat Jeffrey there!|
3351|Maybe the ruins are underneath all this sand?|
3352|Let me use my detector to find out. Hmmm. Hmmmmmmmmm. Why isn't there a reading? Is this thing broken?|
3353|Argh! Why is this happening now?|
3354|Are you okay, sir?|
3355|I need... water...|
3356|Sure! ...wait. Uh... It looks like I lost my water bottle.|
3357|Water... water...|
3358|There... is a stream up ahead. But there are also all sorts of monsters over there.|
3359|I... need... water...|
3360|Don't look at me. There is no way I'm going over there!|
3361|Seriously? You want me to die? Dry up and fall apart? You are too cruel!|
3362|You know, I think you're going to be fine.|
3363|Hey!|
3364|Yikes!|
3365|What are you doing? You scared me half to death!|
3366|I thought a ghost was coming to get me or something.|
3367|Sigh... There's no such thing as ghosts. Stop being dumb.|
3368|Romeo, these floating lights look just like stars. They're so romantic!|
3369|Oh! Sweet Juliet, if you want a star, I will go and catch one for you!|
3370|Dear Romeo, hurry and catch a star for me! I want to hold one in my hands! Even the dust would do!|
3371|Here, Juliet! Look upon this beautiful star!|
3372|Oh geeze! It's a bug! A bug! Aaaaahhhhh!|
3373|Calm down, Juliet! It's just a firefly! All of these beautiful lights are!|
3374|What? Oh no, oh no! I want to get out of here! I hate bugs!|
3375|That didn't go so well...|
3376|These floating lights are so pretty. I want to catch them!|
3377|Why don't you try it?|
3378|I've tried! They just keep getting away!|
3379|It's super easy if you use a net. Just scoop them up and then put them in a jar! Make sure you put holes in the lid, though.|
3380|That's a great idea! I'm gonna go get one! Wait for me!|
3381|What are you doing out here? There's a murderer on the loose!|
3382|Gustav is missing. I have to find him and bring him back!|
3383|I know you're friends, but is he that important to you?|
3384|Yes. I care for him almost as much as I do for you. I can't just abandon him.|
3385|Can't someone else go? I'm worried about you!|
3386|I'm sorry, but I have to go.|
3387|Hehehe! I totally made Miki cry with the joke I played on him!|
3388|What? Why would you do that?|
3389|It isn't my fault that he's so easily scared!|
3390|You know naughty children are eaten by vampires, right?|
3391|What? No! I don't want to be eaten by vampires! I'm sorry!|
3392|We should go apologize to Miki to prove that you're a good kid.|
3393|Okay! Okay!|
3394|A vampire is causing trouble around here? Lucky for us they aren't too tough. A simple purification spell is enough to deal with them.|
3395|Fantastic! Please save us!|
3396|Ten gold a head will suffice.|
3397|Well, it's a bit expensive, but the extra is probably worth not dying.|
3398|Fine! We want to live! Just shut up and take our money!|
3399|Now I just need to sprinkle some of the Holy Exorcism Water on you all. Now, remember! Once I've sprinkled the water on you, you can't bathe for three days. If you do, the power will be lost!|
3400|I've been wandering for so long, but this is the first time I've ever seen a place like this. It's so beautiful... Do you know how this place was formed?|
3401|Yes. It all started a thousand years, and a thousand storms, ago. You know, you might want to pull up a chair. This is going to take some time.|
3402|Could you maybe sum it up? I don't have all day.|
3403|Not if you're going to be like that.|
3404|Argh! You're such a pain!|
3405|I love the sounds of the birds and the bugs.|
3406|Don't enjoy it! Listen carefully! There could be undiscovered creatures out here!|
3407|Fine...|
3408|Time to get started! Now! Concentrate and make sure you don't make any noise!|
3409|...|
3410|Ah hah! That groan was the sound of some strange animal!|
3411|Sorry, but it was just my stomach. I'm really hungry.|
3412|...|
3413|Oh my gosh! It's a unicorn foal! So exciting!|
3414|The other unicorns don't seem to be happy with us around here. Maybe we should leave?|
3415|No way I'm leaving! I need to collect more data!|
3416|Fine, fine, but hurry up! If there's any sign of danger, we're getting out of here!|
3417|I've been lost for so long. I don't know if I'm going to make it back home...|
3418|I shouldn't have pretended I was so tough... This algae is so hard to get. Ernest is probably really worried about me.|
3419|No! I can't give up! Ernest needs that algae!|
3420|Hah! I bet this is where the bandits are hiding their treasure.|
3421|I'm going to double cross them and steal all of it!|
3422|No one can stop me! Mwahahaha!|
3423|Romeo, are we lost?|
3424|Juliet, we've been lost for a while now. Lost in each other, unable to pull away...|
3425|Romeo, while I appreciate the gesture? I think this time we might need to be serious.|
3426|Juliet, I don't ever want to leave your side.|
3427|Oh! Forget it! Romeo, I love you!|
3428|Juliet... I love you too...|
3429|This... smells. Is this urine?|
3430|No! This is my secret recipe, crafted from the urine of at least 10 different animals! Just sprinkle a bit on yourselves and you are guaranteed safe from vampires... and most unwanted attention, honestly.|
3431|Don't worry, it works perfectly well! Besides, I'm already finished with the ceremony. You all can leave now!|
3432|Well, this literally stinks, but I suppose it is better to be safe than sorry.|
3433|...what is wrong with you?|
3434|You seem nervous! What happened?|
3435|I've lost my prized necklace! I can't find it anywhere!|
3436|What does it look like?|
3437|It has a heart shaped gem and it is so very precious to me. It is a token of endless love!|
3438|Uh. Is that it on your neck?|
3439|Oh! You found it! You're wonderful!|
3440|I wonder what those gnomes are plotting. They seem to be sneaking around a lot.|
3441|You're too worried. I doubt the Gnomes want to destroy the peace in this area.|
3442|You know it! Those Gnomes would be idiots to try anything! We'd wipe them out in a blink!|
3443|Just don't go starting a war. I like peace.|
3444|If only the Gnomes were that considerate.|
3445|You're awesome! Be my girlfriend!|
3446|I'm sorry, but we can't. We're not even the same race!|
3447|Get lost, stinking human! You've got no business with our girls!|
3448|I know love can transcend all boundaries! Please, accept me!|
3449|Ah... how could a Human move my heart so? Such a direct request is charming.|
3450|I won't allow this! Get out of here, you stinking human! You, come home with me!|
3451|Ah, so Quenton is the strong one...|
3452|Wait! No! Don't leave me! I can't believe my confession failed!|
3453|I love how the prairie winds feel.|
3454|Yeah. I love it. I remembering flying kites out here when I was little.|
3455|You can still do that, you know.|
3456|Nah. It'd be too embarrassing to do as an adult!|
3457|Come on, let's go! I really want to fly a kite now! We should go together!|
3458|You know, you really drive me crazy sometimes. But I like it.|
3459|I see.|
3460|We Gnomes might be small, but that also makes us pretty sneaky! Those Makar won't even notice me!|
3461|I'm ready, master! What is the next step?|
3462|You need to spy on them and learn what's going on. Be careful to not be discovered! Just peek inside!|
3463|Uh... I'm too short to see inside.|
3464|...a flaw in my plan has become evident. Let us retreat for now!|
3465|Yes master!|
3466|A human wants to participate in our sacred competition? This is the first time I've heard such a foolish thing!|
3467|This is a sacred rite for us Makar! How could we even consider letting a human participate?|
3468|It doesn't matter! We'll crush all competitors! The glory of the Makar is without end!|
3469|Yeah! There is no way a human will win!|
3470|Still, even allowing a human to participate in this competition is humiliating! I don't understand what the King is thinking.|
3471|Don't question the King! If he hears you...|
3472|I feel sick...|
3473|I can't move...|
3474|I am a Gnome! Well, I mean I'm normally a Makar, but I'm a Gnome right now.|
3475|Everyone has been affected by the witch's curse. I hope we can find a cure soon. I can't take much more of this.|
3476|Shashek is the greatest of guardians.|
3477|Yes! He's done his duty for so long!|
3478|I have to admit, I'm curious. How old is he?|
3479|I don't actually know. Maybe you should ask him?|
3480|I think I'm okay. He'll prolly punish me if I ask.|
3481|We should be careful about what we say. It might be best to change topics.|
3482|Why did the King kick Third Prince Odum Ryan out of the tribe? He didn't do anything wrong!|
3483|I can't believe the King is trying to destroy our tribe like this!|
3484|We must overthrow the King and let Odum return to serve as the rightful king!|
3485|That's right! Support Odum! We will save the kingdom!|
3486|Support Odum! Glory be with us!|
3487|Juliet, there is something I have to say to you.|
3488|What is it, Romeo?|
3489|Ju-li-et!|
3490|I don't want to be your boyfriend anymore!|
3491|What? You want to break up with me? Oh gods, what did I do wrong? Nooooo...|
3492|No! Don't cry, dear Juliet! I don't want to break up with you!|
3493|Then why won't you be my boyfriend anymore?|
3494|I want to be more than your boyfriend! I want to become your husband, Juliet!|
3495|Oh. Well then say it quicker next time! I was nearly heartbroken!|
3496|I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you, Juliet. I love you!|
3497|I forgive you, Romeo! I love you too!|
3498|With the shape Jorali returned in, I'm really worried about Shaine.|
3499|Don't worry, Shaine is good! The job will get done, no problem!|
3500|I really hope Shaine is safe.|
3501|Don't worry so much!|
3502|Mrgh! Where are the gold coins?|
3503|Maybe we should give up. It is really dangerous out here!|
3504|No! My wife's gold was hidden out here somewhere! I want it!|
3505|Hurry and help me find it!|
3506|C'mon little cow, let's get back to the village!|
3507|Hurry up! It'll be a disaster if a monster find us here!|
3508|C'mon, cow! I'm begging you! We're going to starve out here!|
3509|This is all your fault! We're going to die because you wanted a cow!|
3510|Desperate times call for desperate measures...|
3511|Moo! Moooooo! Moooooooooooooooo!|
3512|Where did you learn to speak cow?|
3513|I don't want to go back with Jorali! It is terrifying out there!|
3514|Shhh! If someone hears you say that, the Village Chief will have your head!|
3515|There's no way we'll convince the Village Chief to retreat, is there? We should never have come here...|
3516|All we can do is trust that the Chief knows what to do. We don't have another option.|
3517|Yikes! Those spiders are really scary up close!|
3518|I hate this! I hate the dark! I hate spiders! I hate fighting! I want to go home!|
3519|Don't be scared! Brother Zachary will protect us!|
3520|The Varan have taken the village over! Oh no... Are we going to die here?|
3521|I'm sure the people who escaped will get help!|
3522|Do you think anyone will come?|
3523|I'm sure they will!|
3524|I hope you're right...|
3525|The energy keeps fading and the land keeps weakening. I'm not sure what we can do to stop it.|
3526|Why is the forest dying?|
3527|I don't care! I just want to go home!|
3528|I really want to go home...|
3529|Those Varan are scary. Just thinking about them chills me to the bone.|
3530|Why would they take our village? Our homes...|
3531|My boy... I lost track of him while we were trying to escape and now I can't find him! My boy...|
3532|All we can do is wait for the Commander and his soldiers to clear out the Varan.|
3533|This forest used to be so beautiful. You'd come here and forget your worries...|
3534|Just look at this... It really breaks your heart.|
3535|I hope we can figure out why the forest is withering away...|
3536|Romeo, all these barren trees make me feel sad.|
3537|Don't be sad, Juliet! Even this has a charm of its own.|
3538|Romeo, if I were to become ugly like these trees, would you still love me?|
3539|Of course, Juliet! You are the woman I love!|
3540|I... I have to tell you something Romeo! I've... I've gotten too fat to wear my dresses! What should I do?|
3541|Here, let me feel you, Juliet. Oh my, you are indeed soft and squishy! And you know what, I love you for it!|
3542|Romeo! You're too much!|
3543|Oh... this soft and tender feeling... I can't stop! I can't control myself!|
3544|Ah Juliet. A little more meat on your bones wouldn't be bad. It would just make you softer!|
3545|Our guards have been running into a lot of trouble lately. I wonder if something is up.|
3546|I was just thinking the same thing. They've even hired some mercenaries to help out, but they don't seem very... reliable.|
3547|Do you think they'll do the job?|
3548|I don't know. I think our best bet is to pack up and get out.|
3549|Wait for me, please. I'll go with you.|
3550|We can watch each others' backs. Hurry! I'll wait right here for you.|
3551|Maxim is really upset about what happened to the Second Expedition Team.|
3552|Not surprising. He blames himself for them getting lost in the desert and robbed.|
3553|It wasn't his fault though! He did his best for them! He is kind, responsible, caring... I've always admired him...|
3554|Maybe you should tell Maxim that.|
3555|...you're right. It would be better if I told him my feelings directly. Thank you!|
3556|Come see all of the wonderful items we have on auction!|
3557|What sort of things?|
3558|Things like this mysterious chest! It is unopened and might contain valuable treasure!|
3559|Uh huh. But why would I buy it if I didn't know what was inside?|
3560|This chest could be full of treasure! And I'll sell it to you a mere thousand gold coins!|
3561|I'm not paying that much! Ten gold coins is enough!|
3562|Right. Done.|
3563|The price difference is a bit much!|
3564|Fresh fruit! Come buy some fresh fruit!|
3565|What's up with the price of fruit? It's almost too expensive to eat, these days!|
3566|I know, but the fruit comes from so far away the cost of transport raises the price. There's nothing to be done about it.|
3567|Why not plant some fruit at the oasis? There's plenty of water, you should be able to grow something there.|
3568|Oh, good idea! I'll give that a try.|
3569|Great! Everyone will have fresh, cheap fruit to eat.|
3570|I want to be the King of Bandits!|
3571|Wait... Bandits are bad. Do you want to be bad?|
3572|I want to steal from the bad guys, and give the loot to the poor! That's good, right?|
3573|So why not become a Knight, or join the Guard?|
3574|You wanted to be the Knight Captain! I don't want to take that away from you! Hee hee!|
3575|All right, then. I'll be the Knight Captain, you be the King of Thieves, and together we'll deal with the bad guys!|
3576|What is this place? All I see is thorns and rocks... Is there really any treasure here?|
3577|I don't understand! It's marked right here on the treasure map!|
3578|Let me see that map! 
 Hey... This isn't a treasure map, it's just some of my doodling!|
3579|What? I guess I grabbed the wrong... Sorry.|
3580|I don't know why I put up with you. Now we have to start all over again.|
3581|Ahhhhhhh! Monsters! Snake-people!|
3582|Hey! Be quiet! Do you want the monsters to hear you?|
3583|But... They are really terrifying...|
3584|We have been going round and round in the ruins, and we haven't found an exit.  We'll die here, if we don't find a way out!|
3585|Calm down, everyone! This is no time to panic!|
3586|That's right, why don't we stay put and figure out a route, instead of running around like headless chickens!  We can't give up hope, no matter what happens.  We will get out.|
3587|Those gigantic animal bones, buried in sand, are really spectacular... What could have killed something so big?|
3588|These bones appear to have been severely weathered, some of them have become so unrecognizable that you can't tell what animal it was from.|
3589|Why don't we run tests with the appraisal instrument... Huh? It's not working; it must be true what they say, that instruments won't work, once brought into the sands.|
3590|It seems that all we can do is to get some bone samples for further analysis when we go back. Why don't we go do that, and come back after we have the results?|
3591|Each time I see a map of Palmgil Oasis, I always imagine that Crescent Bay must be very pretty. Now that I'm here, I see the bay is as beautiful as I'd hoped.|
3592|Er... Miss...|
3593|You live here, don't you? This place is really great! It must be romantic, living in a small house next to Crescent Bay.|
3594|Miss, I am afraid you misunderstood! You need to go farther southwest to reach Palmgil Oasis.|
3595|Ah ha ha, it turns out that I'm the one who got lost! Thank you very much for reminding me.|
3596|Who are you?|
3597|I am Romeo!|
3598|No! You're not the Romeo I know. My Romeo doesn't have such a swollen face, or beady eyes, or such thin hair!|
3599|On my way here, last night, I was ambushed! I don't know why, but they kept punching me in the face, in my handsome face! Aah Aah Aah!|
3600|Oh, Romeo, you poor poor baby! They must have been jealous of your good looks.|
3601|I thought so too, Juliet! They must also be very jealous of me having such a beautiful and tender girlfriend as you.|
3602|I am responsible for guarding this place.|
3603|You must realize there is a price to pay, yet you still dared come here.|
3604|The Sand Gem!|
3605|What? The Gem is gone!|
3606|You must really love chasing me and ruining my work.|
3607|When I have finished channeling the power of the Sand Gem, you will all die!|
3608|Ahh! I'll kill you!|
3609|No, Helakar! The spell isn't finished yet... Helakar!|
3610|Terrible... It seems the Sand Gem's power is so strong that Helakar can't hear me.|
3611|Oh, no. Did something go wrong? Akara?|
3612|I just woke up, from a thousand-year sleep, to find a swarm of ants right in front of me.|
3613|The thing that really surprised me, though, is you. The prophesied dragon, my nemesis.|
3614|However, I've already obtained immortal power. My destiny awaits. I can forget about this... Or destroy it.|
3615|Aha! The hidden treasure is ours!|
3616|Huh. I will make you eat your words. And, as for the seal, I will make you regret this!|
3617|This... Is really surprising.|
3618|Fate, and chains. Perhaps this is the best ending for Talamund.|
3619|Thank you. It must have been fate that guided you to help me complete my mission... I just had a thought. Maybe this was your mission.|
3620|Still, there's no turning back now. We must complete the spell, then we can figure out what to do next.|
3621|Helakar! No... How could I lose?|
3622|What! What is this? Ahhh!|
3623|Finally, the guardian beast has been defeated. It fought hard, and well, but it's over. I'm sure it was the best end for it.|
3624|Ok, down to business. Let me use the orb to restore the seal!|
3625|Watch me!|
3626|Wait! We have to restore the seal, and help you get the antidote!|
3627|Success!|
3628|Quickly! We must find the Wrathborne Soul to get the antidote!|
3629|Ah! Why is the device still here?|
3630|Look around. The fall of the Wrathborne Temple explains it.|
3631|Food prices are up again. What's going on?|
3632|Whoa! Everything here is so impressive! I love travel...|
3633|Honestly, why are there so many people here today? Is there some special event?|
3634|I heard that there's a new shop, that serves delicious cakes. Why is it so hard to find?|
3635|This place has everything! I could stock up here, and make a nice profit later.|
3636|The houses, they're so beautiful. I hope I have one like these, someday.|
3637|The streets are so clean! I've never seen a city like this.|
3638|The auction site was set up here, because this street gets so much traffic. It does a lot of business.|
3639|I never thought a human village would be so much fun. There are so many interesting things.|
3640|I wanted to play with Miss Sprite today. Why hasn't she shown up?|
3641|Rats! This city is a huge maze. Where is the bank?|
3642|Please, no loitering. This is of military importance.|
3643|It makes a father proud, seeing his daughter become a Navean Priestess.|
3644|It's been my lifelong dream, going to the Sky Tower and reading the Magic Tomes!|
3645|Nice robots, eh? Look at those lines. I made them myself.|
3646|Hmm... Party leader. How could it be?|
3647|Faith is a prison. Only power is real. Death is a release... For you.|
3648|Let me see you!|
3649|Why struggle? It's undignified, and does not suit you.|
3650|I will give you one chance to save yourselves. Make it count!|
3651|Whoa! This jewelry is so beautiful--I want to buy it all and take it home!|
3652|This meat doesn't look so fresh...|
3653|Cha-ching! So many gold coins. I'll take these back to my grandpa. Ha ha ha!|
3654|The drinks that Sita sells are the best in the city!|
3655|Ms. Laura, mother wants me to buy three cakes and bring them back.|
3656|If it weren't for you, I'd be dead! I owe you my life!|
3657|But... Uh... Who are you?|
3658|You're here to get the rice cakes back? Great!|
3659|I think they're hiding the rice cakes in those big jars up near the fork. Hurry and bring them back!|
3660|Hey! Envoy of Gaia! Here I am!|
3661|So, you found it already?|
3662|Hey! Shhh! I'm in the brush behind you! Get over here!|
3663|Hmmm. This isn't nearly as much as we lost. Their king must have the rest!|
3664|Looks like we'll have to defeat him if we want the rest of our rice cakes back!|
3665|Hmm? What's wrong?|
3666|Uh... Didn't you tell me you'd found some unidentified power core, not a giant robot?|
3667|Captain!|
3668|Captain... Run... Run for your life...|
3669|Are you kidding me? We'll destroy that hunk of junk! Stand and fight!|
3670|Could you try to... limit the damage? I could... get some valuable information... out of it...|
3671|Why do you have to be so stubborn? Fine! You just focus on not dying!|
3672|Let's do this!|
3673|Finally! Stupid hunk of junk...|
3674|How many did we lose?|
3675|About half the squad.|
3676|...|
3677|Ugh... my head...|
3678|Are you okay?|
3679|I... think I'm okay. I saw some strange things though...|
3680|Oh? Like what?|
3681|We aren't the only ones investigating. There are others... from other worlds...|
3682|Human! Repent for your stupidity!|
3683|Human... We will never... give up...|
3684|Why... why do I have to... die?|
3685|Rest in peace...|
3686|Aaaaah!|
3687|This mud stinks!|
3688|Oh shut up, we stink too!|
3689|I need a bath...|
3690|How about we never take this kind of job again?|
3691|Sounds like a good plan. I don't think I'll ever be able to smell again...|
3692|I think we should demand some extra pay for this one, eh?|
3693|That's a great idea, boss!|
3694|Mmhmmm...|
3695|We'll be on our way now. Take care!|
3696|Father? Wait, you're not my father! You're just some filthy human!|
3697|Black Marsh... don't blame the Humans. This is my fault.|
3698|Your fault? Of course it's your fault! If you hadn't wanted me to live, why did you create me?|
3699|I was young and arrogant. I wanted to use the Cube to have the ultimate power... the ability to create life...|
3700|But a monster wasn't good enough for you, was it? WAS IT? I am nothing but a mistake! A blight on your name!|
3701|I never thought I would create something like you. You were so strange.|
3702|I wasn't even sure you were alive. I was... ashamed, yes.|
3703|You're right. I am a despicable person. I couldn't accept you.|
3704|Your very existence pains me. But with age comes wisdom. My life is one filled with mistakes and regret.|
3705|Let me redeem myself now. I'll follow you on the lonely road of death.|
3706|Your words are sweet, but why should I believe you?|
3707|You have taught me that humans are nothing but liars and scum!|
3708|I know. That's why I will go on ahead and wait for you...|
3709|...father...|
3710|Boss, who are those guys? They really rocked!|
3711|You can say that again! It only took them a moment to defeat that mud monster!|
3712|That's for sure! They are the most amazing adventurers I have ever seen!|
3713|Boss, could we be as good as them?|
3714|Look at us! Of course we can't. Are you kidding?|
3715|Well... I guess we're better dressed, at least?|
3716|Darn straight. And we budget better too, I bet.|
3717|Well, looks like everything is fine! Let's get out of here!|
3718|Hey! Stop muttering! Your muttering is giving me a serious headache...|
3719|Boss, should we just leave this old man here?|
3720|Yes! Just get going!|
3721|Yes, Boss!|
3722|May the prairie bless you, King...|
3723|Ah, Gareth. Surely you know coming into my lands without an offering is a grave offense?|
3724|However, since your father was a great warrior, I suppose I can offer you an opportunity to explain yourself.|
3725|I have brought you a gift, King Karka. A way to create peace between our tribes.|
3726|First, though. First, as the Parallax Prince and heir to the throne, I challenge you to honorable combat.|
3727|Ha. Hahaha! Do you tease me, little princeling? You are nothing to me. Only your father was ever a match for my me!|
3728|My father, in his age, has become timid and cautious. I have come to act boldly in our tribe's best interests!|
3729|Interesting. Interesting!|
3730|Zangis! Ashworth! Zolg! Why not give our guest a warm welcome? I want to see if he is all talk!|
3731|I will show him my strength! Let the name "Zangis" be burned into your memory!|
3732|Let me show you why I'm called "The Butcher"...|
3733|I'm going to make a kebab out of you! Hehehe! Hahahaha! No, no, no, no! That's wrong! I'll kebab your mum and your pa! Hehehe! Hahahaha!|
3734|Your name was Zolg, right? Let me show you the price for mocking my parents.|
3735|What? My warriors were defeated?|
3736|Was defeating the three of them enough to prove my strength?|
3737|I... I... can't... fall...|
3738|I guess I underestimated you...|
3739|No! No! No! No! No!|
3740|Hmph.|
3741|Wha- What are you doing?|
3742|Remember this, Zolg. Insult my family again, and I will end you.|
3743|Hmph. It seems you three have gotten fat and weak.|
3744|It was... my fault...|
3745|I have dishonored you, King. Punish me however you see fit.|
3746|Well...|
3747|I'll decide what to do after I deal with this whelp.|
3748|You've earned your challenge, princeling. Let us hope you don't regret it.|
3749|Three days. I will give you three days to rest and heal. Then you will reap what you have sown.|
3750|As you wish, King Karka.|
3751|You dare to enter our territory without a tribute?|
3752|Beat it, kid!|
3753|He came here alone? How bold.|
3754|Hurry! Capture him!|
3755|Why are you wasting your time? Just kill him!|
3756|Bring honor to our tribe and end his life!|
3757|You are quite daring for such a tiny person.|
3758|Lord Zangis! Show him your power!|
3759|There's no way you can beat Lord Zangis!|
3760|Lord Zangis is the greatest!|
3761|No foe has ever gotten past Lord Zangis! He has stood alone against entire armies and crushed them!|
3762|Dismember 'im, Zolg!|
3763|Tear him in half!|
3764|Skewer him and put him out in front! Show everyone we mean business!|
3765|Who needs the other two with Zolg around?|
3766|Lord Ashworth alone is enough to defeat you!|
3767|Lord Ashworth has defeated entire tribes on his own!|
3768|Butcher! Butcher!|
3769|This is all the great "Desert Stalwart" is? Were you trying to entertain me?|
3770|What the heck are you talking about?|
3771|Shut up! All of you!|
3772|Zolg is nothing but a raving lunatic!|
3773|Careful, whelp. You're biting off more than you can chew.|
3774|Come on! Let's fight!|
3775|Haw! Haw! Isn't he the one who wounded your butt when you were fighting over food?|
3776|Shut up! We weren't gonna talk about that!|
3777|Hurry up! My honey-buns is expecting me to meet her soon!|
3778|I don't care about you, your "honey-buns," or your plans!|
3779|How could the Desert Stalwart have been defeated?|
3780|Our greatest warrior!|
3781|He was cheated!|
3782|Unbelievable!|
3783|This is a nightmare! Lord Ashworth, defeated?|
3784|The Butcher has never been defeated! What is happening?|
3785|Ohhhhhh! How can this be?|
3786|Zolg, you're kidding, right? This is a joke?|
3787|Mulligan! Mulligan!|
3788|Looks like you earned that butt wound, eh?|
3789|STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT!|
3790|Finally, I can go see my honey-buns!|
3791|ENOUGH ABOUT HER!|
3792|Oh man, this smell is almost lethal!|
3793|This place needs a purification, right boss?|
3794|I told you to stop calling me... you know, never mind.|
3795|Just get things ready, okay?|
3796|Yes, boss!|
3797|...|
3798|Do we really need to purify this place? It just smells...|
3799|Right now it just smells. Give it time. Breathing will get difficult, then the skin ulcers will start...|
3800|Oh...|
3801|Are we... are we going to be okay here?|
3802|Of course! Don't you remember the medicine we took?|
3803|That was medicine? I thought it was just some nasty drink.|
3804|...no, it was a specially prepared medicine that will allow us to withstand the gas until we can purify the area.|
3805|Ohhhhh! I get it! Hey, where is everyone?|
3806|Would you two hurry up? We don't have all day!|
3807|This place really stinks!|
3808|I never thought I'd agree with Watermelon. I need a bath...|
3809|You two, stay alert!|
3810|Relax, boss! Nothing has happened so far.|
3811|Oh no! M-Monsters! Aaaaaaaaaah!|
3812|Watermelon! Cantaloupe! You two take the east! Galia and I will take the west. We make our way north while we guard our sides!|
3813|Ha... ha... Those monsters were pretty tough...|
3814|I'm glad we hired some adventurers to protect us.|
3815|This work is way too dangerous... Once we get back to town, I'm quitting, getting married, and settling down!|
3816|Less talking, more working! The sooner we finish, the sooner we can get out of here!|
3817|Yes, boss!|
3818|I'm glad these monsters are easy to deal with. There are certainly a lot of them...|
3819|Their attacks are so disgusting though. What kind of monsters attacks by spitting mud at you?|
3820|Well, Gareth? Are you ready to be defeated?|
3821|Perhaps you should save the insults until you've won? It would be quite humiliating if you were to talk so big and lose.|
3822|Hahaha! Good! Good! You are your father's son! It is making me miss the old days!|
3823|Now there is one last matter to attend to... Amanita!|
3824|According to tradition, both duelists must be blessed by a warlock.|
3825|Since you do not have a warlock with you, will you accept my disciple as yours, Prince Gareth?|
3826|Of course. Who would turn down the disciple of the greatest warlock in the prairie?|
3827|Oh great ancestors, bless these warriors with your strength. Grant them unyielding wills and boundless courage! Let any who would interfere endure your wrath!|
3828|Now the blessing is complete! Let the winner be bathed in your glorious light!|
3829|This is your last chance, Prince Gareth. You sure you want to continue?|
3830|Don't ask questions you already know the answer to, King Karka.|
3831|Hahaha! Great! Let's go!|
3832|Our King is going to destroy that little upstart!|
3833|Teach that kid a lesson, King!|
3834|After that kid loses, we should throw whatever's left of him out like trash!|
3835|This prince is a weakling!|
3836|Mmm... cough...|
3837|I think we are done here. Admit defeat, Prince Gareth.|
3838|I will never admit defeat... Never!|
3839|Hahaha! You're just as stubborn as your father...|
3840|Here, here! This is the place! Leanne was right! The dragon lives here!|
3841|Are these... eggs? Oh my! These eggs are alive!|
3842|There's something weird here, but I can't put my finger on it. Still, we wouldn't have found this without Leanne's help!|
3843|That's a lot of eggs. Like... more than Leanne said there were. Way more.|
3844|These look like Red Dragon eggs, if I remember my books right. But I thought Red Dragons were extinct...|
3845|Maybe the book was wrong about that... This place is well hidden...|
3846|Leanne can't find Auntie and Uncle! Could the big mean dragon have eaten them?|
3847|Wait? What is Leanne's bunny doing here?|
3848|Ahhhhhh! Leanne... Leanne's head hurts! It hurts!|
3849|Leanne! What's wrong with you?|
3850|Leanne didn't know! The bad dragon! The bad dragon...|
3851|I feel...|
3852|Bad dragon? Leanne, take it easy! Slow down and tell us...|
3853|Bad dragon... The Village... Bunny... Leanne... Leanne is a...|
3854|Leanne is a...|
3855|Are you all right? Are you hurt?|
3856|No. I'm okay, don't worry...|
3857|Please, do not be afraid, Humans. We mean no harm to you.|
3858|And you are...?|
3859|We are what you believed: Red Dragons. The one you call Leanne is one of our young.|
3860|But... people have explored so much and never seen a Red Dragon anywhere...|
3861|We migrated to the edge of the world a very long time ago. A very long time ago. It is no surprise you would not have seen our kind.|
3862|Besides, this place is sealed by powerful magic. Without the help of one of our own, it would be impossible to enter here.|
3863|Migrated...? But why! You are the most powerful creatures I've ever seen! You could rule these lands! If Leanne is just a child... I can't even fathom what you must be capable of...|
3864|Physically, yes. Had we wanted, we could have sat over all others as rulers.|
3865|But... why didn't you?|
3866|Because strength is not everything. The fear and avarice in the hearts of Humans is great.|
3867|Individually, our power is great. But when enough come to fear our power or covet our wealth...|
3868|We did not expect it when it came. We lived among the Humans, never suspecting that they plotted against us. When they struck, it was without warning...|
3869|We lost many of our kin in that time. We were scattered and alone. Those of who remained found this place...|
3870|A gate.|
3871|Most humans cannot reach here, but for those who can, I created this barrier. I gave up half my life to create it.|
3872|So... Uh... We forced you to migrate.|
3873|Don't worry, young adventurer. The sins of the father do not belong to the child. We do not blame you for the choices of your ancestors.|
3874|I am sorry for the trouble Leanne has caused. Her memory is... erratic. She escaped from us when her curiosity got the better of the her.|
3875|No wonder she didn't realize what she was...|
3876|Mm. As much as I would like to continue to talk, you should probably leave. While we do not blame the child, that doesn't mean there aren't those among us who would not be upset that a Human were here.|
3877|Hmm...|
3878|I understand. Please tell Leanne it was a pleasure to meet her. What happened wasn't her fault.|
3879|It is good to see such a kind Human again. Peace be with you.|
3880|Based on the data we've gathered, that robot is probably some sort of scout. We've seen several of them already.|
3881|This civilization is far more advanced than us. I wonder if we'd be able to reverse-engineer some of their technology?|
3882|Hmm... We need to report this to our regimental commander. I need some help clearing up, though. We need to get this machine back to base, and of course take care of our dead.|
3883|My King!!|
3884|The king is coughing up blood!! What happened?!|
3885|What did Gareth do?!|
3886|My king, noooo!!|
3887|Everyone, keep away, the king has contracted an infection! If we're not careful, it may spread!|
3888|Infected?! The king was infected?|
3889|Catch that brat, Gareth! It must have been him!|
3890|It seems everyone who has challenged the Infernal Abyss has been crushed...|
3891|No one can defeat Zaahir.|
3892|If you're so afraid, why don't you run away?|
3893|*sob*|
3894|Is that... a kid?|
3895|I thought the village had been evacuated! Why is there a kid here?|
3896|The kid is right up there!|
3897|Wait! Wait!|
3898|Hey, little girl? Where are your parents?|
3899|Leanne has no idea... *sob*|
3900|Leanne? Okay, Leanne. I need you to be a tough girl, though. Can you tell me what happened?|
3901|There was a huge dragon! It flew down and burned things and everyone was running and screaming and... *sob*|
3902|A dragon? But why?|
3903|Don't worry, Leanne. We'll keep you safe...|
3904|Who are those people coming out of the fire?|
3905|I think those are the Fire Sprites.|
3906|I've never seen so many at once... Why are they here? And why are they so nervous looking?|
3907|We'll work that out later. Let's clear them out so they can't do any more damage.|
3908|Leanne's bunny doll is gone...|
3909|Leanne, be a good girl. We'll help you find your bunny as soon as we can! I need you to be tough! Can you do that?|
3910|Yes! Leanne will listen to big sister!|
3911|Wow! You two are great! Can you maybe do Leanne a favor?|
3912|Don't worry about your bunny! We'll go find it!|
3913|No, no... even though Leanne would like her bunny...|
3914|Could big brother and big sister get rid of the mean dragon that's following Leanne?|
3915|Following you? A dragon is following you?|
3916|Yes. Wherever Leanne goes, the dragon goes. I wake up and everything is on fire and people are running and screaming... *sob*|
3917|Leanne wants the dragon to go away! *sob*|
3918|Don't worry, Leanne. You don't need to be afraid. We'll help you.|
3919|But we do need to find the dragon first...|
3920|Leanne knows! Leanne knows where it is!|
3921|You know where the dragon's lair is?|
3922|What, big brother doesn't believe Leanne?|
3923|No, it's just... just lead the way.|
3924|Sure! You have to follow Leanne closely, though!|
3925|Do you think she really knows where it lives?|
3926|I don't know. There's something strange about her.|
3927|Either way, let's go check it out.|
3928|All right, you're the boss!|
3929|Hey! Hey! Check out what we found over here!|
3930|It is a locomotive core? Some sort of generator? Geeze, look at this thing. This is way more complicated than anything I've ever seen.|
3931|Could this be technology from another world?|
3932|We've been digging for so long and we're FINALLY getting somewhere.|
3933|This discovery is gonna shut everyone who ever doubted us up.|
3934|Calm down. Let's not get too excited. We need to figure out how to get out of here. We're not exactly heroic adventurers anymore.|
3935|We should get the commander to dispatch some help here. Why don't you try to get in contact with him?|
3936|Yessir!|
3937|Okay. Let's test this thing out before they get here.|
3938|Hey, check this out. It looks like a control panel of some sort...|
3939|Really? Let me take a look...|
3940|Huh? Did it activate? Waaaaaaaaah! My head! My head hurts so much!|
3941|Are you okay? What's happening?|
3942|What's this thing made of? I can't get it off!|
3943|I... see things...|
3944|What? What are you seeing?|
3945|What's happening here?|
3946|This... thing just activated some sort of defense system, I think!|
3947|Er...|
3948|Hey, this looks like Amara's favorite mug....|
3949|Very well, human. Master Amara has decided to grant you a single wish.|
3950|Spit it out already, pitiful human! What is your wish?|
3951|Master Amara has decided to forgive you this time, human, but there will be no leniency next time!|
3952|Master Amara's Fifth Thunder Heaven!|
3953|Poison...? You think I did it...?! O-of course not!|
3954|...It was the blessing! Someone used the blessing to do it!|
3955|  You... you really are our king! Not even poison can stop you....|
3956|Y-you...! Amanita...!|
3957|Oh no! His Majesty is coughing up more blood!|
3958|Um, can you repeat that, Your Majesty? I didn't quite catch that....|
3959|Kill... Kill... Amanita....|
3960|  Perhaps it'll be easier, Your Majesty, to just let yourself go. I will make sure your wishes are fulfilled honorably.|
3961|Everyone, the King... he has passed on....|
3962|No, my King!|
3963|Kill him! He killed the King!|
3964|Execute him!|
3965|N-no! It wasn't me! Amanita poisoned him, not me!|
3966|How could a high-ranking mage kill the king? Why did you do it?|
3967|  Goodbye, innocent Gareth....|
3968|*Cough!*|
3969|Avenge the king!|
3970|Troops, stand your ground!|
3971|If negotiations unravel, we must do our best to save Cyril!|
3972|Yes, sir!|
3973|Fellow mages, we all know that fire can destroy the creatures of the forest....|
3974|To keep them at bay, please donate a touch of magic to create a giant bonfire!|
3975|No problem, this will be easy!|
3976|Cyril, it's up to you now. Our survival out in this forest depends on you....|
3977|I used to think the Sky Tower was a terrifying place, but it's not so bad.|
3978|Look there! There are spinning orbs!|
3979|Oh no, ghosts! Aaaaaaahh!|
3980|G-ghosts?! W-where?!|
3981|Ghosts my foot! That's just an illusion! Mere parlor tricks! Who are you trying to scare?|
3982|A-an illusion? R-really? Ok... I'm sorry, I'm just terrified of ghosts....|
3983|My word, that robot looks rather... mobile, doesn't it!|
3984|It's more than mobile! It's murderous!|
3985|Ugh... If we leave now, will we make it in time?|
3986|We can't just pass right in front of it, can we?|
3987|Oh? T-th-then what should we do?|
3988|I know! Play dead!|
3989|Will that really work? I thought playing dead only works on bears....|
3990|Either you try or you die for real!|
3991|W-what?! Th-th-then I'm dead, too!|
3992|It's a good thing I'm so clever, or we'd be dead now.|
3993|Playing dead actually worked....|
3994|Hurry it up! We need to get to the second floor!|
3995|H-hey! Aren't we leaving?|
3996|What are you, blind? How could you miss that giant treasure chest? This place must be loaded with goodies! We're not leaving here empty-handed!|
3997|That's... not good, right?|
3998|Enough of this blathering! I'm the leader, so what I say goes!|
3999|The leader of what? It's just you and me here!|
4000|You're still mumbling on? Let's go already!|
4001|Have you heard anything?|
4002|I've heard the sound of the ocean waves. Does that count?|
4003|It's always better to stay in bed, at times like this.|
4004|We always get the worst guard shifts. The best postings go to the guards with seniority.|
4005|Who's there?|
4006|What are you going to do when you get back home?|
4007|I'd like to run a decent business...|
4008|Did you see that? Something's moving...|
4009|Well? Go take a look. I'll cover you from here.|
4010|Which beer do you think tastes better?|
4011|This light beer's not bad.|
4012|How can you say that? It's stout or it's out, that's my creed!|
4013|There are still three challengers before you reach Montero, but none present a real threat.|
4014|Listen up! This robot has 4 moves you can use.|
4015|Heavy Punch, Defend, Break Defense, and Energy Regeneration. Winning is all about picking the right move at the right time.|
4016|Observe your opponent very carefully, and don't make any stupid moves.|
4017|Ha, you had it coming! You really deserved that!|
4018|Didn't I warn you, Montero? You can't compete with me. You're not even close.|
4019|I'll cut you in half!|
4020|You'll be another piece of scrap for the heap!|
4021|Just pray it'll all end quickly!|
4022|Yeah!|
4023|I've been waiting for so long!|
4024|Unbelievable! Augustus won!|
4025|Augustus fought tooth-and-nail this time - his victory should come as a surprise to no one.|
4026|C'mon, Rock Warrior!|
4027|Go-go Augustus Mk. VII!|
4028|No! I can't believe Rock Warrior lost!|
4029|Unbelievable... Augustus won. I thought he'd lose for sure.|
4030|I think Rock Warrior isn't actually that strong at all.|
4031|What an exciting match!|
4032|Go, Iron Dragon! Smash 'em to bits!|
4033|We're counting on you, Iron Dragon!|
4034|You better not lose, Augustus Mk. VII!|
4035|I don't believe it. Augustus won.|
4036|How can this be...|
4037|Augustus seems more menacing this time.|
4038|Looks like the Augustus Mk. VII is this year's dark horse!|
4039|Montero...I've been waiting so long to savor this day!|
4040|Ah! Montero!|
4041|Mon-ter-o! Mon-ter-o! We love you!|
4042|Montero! Finish him!|
4043|Montero's got this clinched.|
4044|Go-go Augustus Mk. VII!|
4045|No way...|
4046|Yeah! Augustus wins!|
4047|This can't be real!|
4048|Uh...how did Montero lose?|
4049|How is it that every time I cheer for someone, they lose?|
4050|Help! Somebody! Stop these bulls!|
4051|Yikes...! This is crazy! Somebody help me!|
4052|We have gathered together to witness each challenger prove their mettle.|
4053|I've made an exception this year, allowing a human to join the contest...|
4054|Don't worry, father. I'll tear them to pieces!|
4055|Inviting a human? Where will the absurdities end?|
4056|You two! As your king, I command you to shut up while I'm talking.|
4057|Yes sir...|
4058|Very well... Now I, as King, do officially|
4059|Without further ado, let's welcome our first participant to the arena - Goliath!|
4060|It's really Goliath! He's so tall...|
4061|Finish hiiiiim!|
4062|Is there even a need for this fight? It's obvious the human will lose.|
4063|Feh. Just give me one punch, short-stack, and I'll send you flyin' up to meet Gaia.|
4064|Round one...fight!|
4065|Whoa...|
4066|A human laid out a Makar Centurion? How is that even possible?|
4067|If this human can best one of us, how strong are the rest of them?|
4068|Allow me to join the match, father! I'll snap that human in two.|
4069|...|
4070|Ha-ha, good joke, guys! Come on! Somebody bring the centurion out here.|
4071|Silence! A human has won the first match.|
4072|Shalen! Who is next? Come now, the king will not be kept waiting.|
4073|Yes, your majesty! The next match is...|
4074|There's no need! Let me be their challenger.|
4075|Look! It's Mummer the Warlord, hero of the people!|
4076|Look, dear! It's your favorite warlord!|
4077|The commander himself is entering the ring... Is this human even worth the trouble?|
4078|Commander, wait! You can't just change...the-|
4079|Mmm...interesting. Mummer, I grant you permission to fight.|
4080|I thank you for your approval, my liege!|
4081|Oooo-kay, so... It's Mummer the Warlord versus our spunky human challenger!|
4082|It's...it's not possible... Mummer the Warlord, LOSE? That human is a filthy cheat! Are you blind, my king?|
4083|How dare you speak to the king like that! Know your place!|
4084|I have to admit, that human fought fiercely...|
4085|That human can take one massive beating! More, more!|
4086|Are there no braver Makar? Come, stand up!|
4087|Hah...the audience only cheers for the strongest! That's the truth of the Arena.|
4088|Puny human... I hope you've got enough courage for a duel. C'mon!|
4089|Simmer down, Palo. Don't let your words of anger stain the honor of the Makar.|
4090|Yes, Father...|
4091|Father, let me fight!|
4092|Mhm... Mummer is your hero, isn't he? Go, and let us see if you've matured as a warrior.|
4093|With pleasure. Shalen, mark the next match as mine!|
4094|Our next match is Second Prince Para versus the up-and-coming human gladiator!|
4095|It was a good run for a human, but it's gotta end here. After all, this is Prince Para we're talking about.|
4096|Pa-ra! Pa-ra! Pa-ra!|
4097|Shhhhh! Don't ruin the atmosphere.|
4098|You guards yapping over there: Shut up! You're not paid to commentate.|
4099|Are you ready? I'll show you no mercy.|
4100|Father... I lost. Please forgive me for bringing shame upon this house.|
4101|You fought well, my son, and I am proud. Now, rest and recover.|
4102|Father! Let me fight in the arena! Victory will be mine!|
4103|Very well, then. Let the glory of victory remain with the Makar.|
4104|Just wait and see, father. I'll tear that kid apart.|
4105|In our final match, it's the Eldest Prince Palo versus the human warrior!|
4106|Don't say a word. Otherwise the Prince is gonna kill you...|
4107|The eldest prince is supposed to be the most valiant of the Makar warriors. That human's fate is really sealed now.|
4108|C'mon, Prince Palo! Strike down that human!|
4109|Glory to the Makar! Glory to the Eldest Prince!|
4110|Adonis... The Eldest Prince really means to kill the human. Aren't you going to stop the match?|
4111|No... This is their fate, and each must rise to face it.|
4112|You should've turned tail while you had the chance! Die, stupid human!|
4113|H-how can it be? I...lost?|
4114|The prince! What just happened?|
4115|Aah!|
4116|What's going on!|
4117|Palo!  What did you drink?|
4118|Brother! What are you doing... Palo, no!|
4119|This match is out of control. Should we intervene?|
4120|No...let us see how this contender handles a life-or-death challenge.|
4121|Well done, human!|
4122|Eldest Prince Palo has brought shame to the Makar.|
4123|The King must be furious...|
4124|Kali! Hurry and tend to my brother.|
4125|Ugh... The match... This is just....|
4126|Palo... you have disappointed me today.|
4127|Finally, it's getting started!|
4128|Yeah! The fight's about to start!|
4129|Wait, what's going on? Where'd this human come from? Get 'em outta here!|
4130|Order, order! Remain calm; don't push.|
4131|Step back! Don't cross the security line...or else.|
4132|Fruits and vegetables! Get your fruits and veggies here! Good for your health and tasty, too!|
4133|Duuude, I'm sooo hungry!|
4134|In this sandy area, you can find worms everywhere. You won't go hungry, that's for sure.|
4135|Like I'd eat that kind of cheap stuff. Hah!|
4136|......|
4137|Dude, I'm telling you, you wouldn't believe how hungry I am right now.|
4138|Aaaah, shaddup, you dirty bird.|
4139|Patrolling this awful place always ends up filling my shoes with sand.|
4140|I'd rather play in the sand than go sailing and lose my lunch over the railing.|
4141|A seasick pirate? Shame, shame, shaaaaaame.|
4142|Look, footprints! Intruders!|
4143|Those are YOUR footprints...|
4144|Oh, really? I was just...uh...testing you.|
4145|Who are you? What are you doing here?|
4146|Mmm? Treasure? Sorry, but I don't see... Oh, you're good at this!|
4147|Let me report this to the Adjutant. Why don't you take it around and show a few others first?|
4148|Whoa, is that a cart full of jewels?|
4149|Really? I don't see anything.|
4150|Really! Can't you see it sparkling? Looks like it's worth a fortune!|
4151|Don't even think about it. You won't get to lay one grubby finger on those jewels.|
4152|...True, true. Not much left after the adjutants take their share.|
4153|Least you've still got food and clothes. Just let it go - our lives are what they are.|
4154|What? I can't believe there's stuff this good lying around on the beach! I've gotta get my hands on more!|
4155|Hey! What do you think you're doing here?|
4156|Wait...this isn't right. I'd better notify Bluto first. If I go running off, I'll catch holy hell for it later.|
4157|Show the treasure to others; the more hands we have, the more we can collect. Hey, you guys! You'd better not leave your posts!|
4158|Jeez... Runnin' so fast there, I might as well've been flying...|
4159|When I went out pirating yesterday, I had no idea where he was.|
4160|I saw him drinking inside the cabin...|
4161|Alright, alright, stop complaining. Greedy and cowardly as he is, he's generous with the rewards when he's drunk...|
4162|Aye, true, that. Keep his mug full tonight, then!|
4163|Humph, let me see it...|
4164|Well, considering your limited skills, this ain't that bad.|
4165|Hmph. Regardless, I'm going to report this to Bluto first.|
4166|Huff... Huff...|
4167|You'd best be turning heel and leaving - this is the adjutant's camp. No entry allowed.|
4168|We heard that the Adjutant's waitin' for you. Go on in.|
4169|You could tell he was excited, but he tried to play it cool...|
4170|Is that really necessary? We're pirates, for the love of blood and rum! Of course we want treasure!|
4171|Stop yer blubbering for a minute and think! A whole chest of jewels! We'll finally have our fair share!|
4172|Aye, you make a very persuasive point.|
4173|Huh? It's real? I thought I was imagining it...|
4174|Well... Thank you for a job well-done. I'll go inform the Adjutant right away.|
4175|..........|
4176|Hey, hey! It's the treasure! Don't doze off like those guards.|
4177|Who's making all that racket? You 'ave a death wish or somethin'?|
4178|Get lost! There's nothing for you here.|
4179|Well, let me report to Bluto. It'd be best for him to make the call on this issue.|
4180|Hey, did you see? A whole cartload of treasure!|
4181|Sure did. And the one pullin' the cart said there's even more to be had at the beach!|
4182|Why do I have this feeling that something ain't right?|
4183|I'm so tired...|
4184|I didn't whine about being tired, and I have to guard the entrance. You've got the easiest post; you've got no right to complain.|
4185|Alright, stop! The one you're talking about...is here.|
4186|Mmm... That's some fascinating treasure!|
4187|With all due respect, sir, treasure doesn't just fall from the sky. I'm worried that this might be a trap.|
4188|Ah, don't be such a ninny. Forget about traps - we can handle any surprises!|
4189|The point is, you can't just leave things there like that!|
4190|So sleepy...|
4191|That's enough... Didn't I just tell all of you to be quiet!?|
4192|We've gotta go there ourselves, at any costs. We're pirates, for Gaia's sake - taking treasure is what we DO.|
4193|Anyone afraid of a little danger doesn't deserve the pirate's life! Cowards can go take a short walk off the plank.|
4194|If there're no opposition, then mates, it's time to score ourselves some treasure!|
4195|Hoo-rah!|
4196|Yes!|
4197|Is this haul more valuable than a big, tasty dinner?|
4198|Fool! With this much loot, you'll be able to dine like a king for a year if you want!|
4199|You sure? How come I don't see that?|
4200|Have you seen that pile of loot?|
4201|I did - and heard there's more to be had on the seashore.|
4202|I want to scoop shovelfuls of it into a barrel, just for me!|
4203|I know! I can hardly wait, but until the Adjutant gives the word, we can't go anywhere.|
4204|Aw, hell. Not many people would just waltz into a pirate camp with their treasure.|
4205|I want you to know that I...er...have feelings. For you.|
4206|I know. Say no more.|
4207|Do you really know? I've had these feelings for a long time...|
4208|I know. I deeply appreciate what you've done for me.|
4209|I...think maybe you're misunderstanding me here.|
4210|No, I think I know what you mean. I feel the same way about you.|
4211|!!!|
4212|Are you all right? You have a weird look on your face.|
4213|Stop!|
4214|Not another step!|
4215|Go to hell!|
4216|Uh oh!|
4217|Oh? You have a spirit with you...|
4218|It looks like we're not so different. C'mon, join me!|
4219|We've been chosen by destiny. Why concern yourself with the weak?|
4220|The weak are just stepping stones on our path to glory! But if you stand in my way...|
4221|...I'll take you out right here and save myself a lot of trouble.|
4222|I lost to a kid like this? It's not possible!|
4223|Ever since I heeded fate's call, I put weakness behind me.|
4224|This can't be my limit! I'm stronger than this!|
4225|Aaagh! Spirit! I offer up my soul...just give me more strength!|
4226|I. Will. Kill. You.|
4227|Urgh... You're stronger than I expected. Looks like fate has chosen you.|
4228|Don't think you've won, though.|
4229|One day, you'll be just like me. It's just a matter of time...|
4230|Someday, you'll want power...and you'll be willing to pay any price to get it.|
4231|I'll be watching you...from Pandemonium's shores...|
4232|Thank the heavens. You stopped Brian just in time.|
4233|Yes...|
4234|This kid won? Is he crazy, like Brian?|
4235|Kane? What are you mumbling about?|
4236|Ah, it's nothin'.|
4237|Shall we proceed, then? If you wish to be my companion, I expect you to provide good conversation.|
4238|How are you feeling? Ill?|
4239|I can't thank you enough for saving our child. York and I don't know what we'd do without him.|
4240|After what happened, it'll be hard to let you go. After all, we've known you ever since you were just a little kid.|
4241|Regardless of what folks you meet think, I want you to know you mean the world to us, and you'll always have a home here.|
4242|I hope that you'll be safe on your journey. Take care of yourself out there.|
4243|Look! Everyone's gathered right up ahead.|
4244|Well, look who's coming!|
4245|Everyone here knows this face - one of Skandia's finest, up-and-coming youths.|
4246|If it weren't for them, who knows what terrible fate might have befallen my son Joel.|
4247|Saving someone's life is a noble deed - one that takes great courage. I only hope that all the young people of Skandia will grow up to be equally brave.|
4248|Today, they've made a difficult decision: to leave our little village and embark on a long journey.|
4249|Let's show our support, friends, and offer up our blessings and well-wishes for safety on the road.|
4250|Thank you so much for saving Joel.|
4251|And...take care of yourself out there. I hope you'll find what it is you seek.|
4252|Ohhhh, why do you have to go? *sob*|
4253|Be a good boy, Joel. How about a smile and a wave for the hero who saved you?|
4254|O-okay. I won't cry anymore. *sniff*|
4255|But...you have to promise me that you'll come back and play...|
4256|Cough... Cough...|
4257|Hmm, you don't look well. To be honest, I didn't sleep that well either.|
4258|I... Er... Anyway, I still want to thank you for stopping Brian in time.|
4259|And, well... You might not like hearing this, but...|
4260|I think you made the right decision, considering the circumstances.|
4261|Hmm, right, that's all. Er...|
4262|I...wish you all the best on your journey.|
4263|Go, go, go!|
4264|Kane, what are you saying?|
4265|Are you finished? Hey!|
4266|Me? Hmm... no, I have nothing else to say.|
4267|You've become quite the hero!|
4268|You've only worked under me for a short time...|
4269|...but you're one of the finest lumberjacks I've worked with.|
4270|All right, kiddo. Carry on, and keep up the good work.|
4271|I'm relieved to see you've grown into someone reliable.|
4272|You save lives, as I do. We might use different approaches, but we're not so different from doctors: saving people is our goal in life.|
4273|It is an honor to have worked with you. I'm happy we're both traveling the same path.|
4274|I think you'll stay true to your goals and do a lot of good in the world.|
4275|Move ahead and be bold! I pray that whatever difficulties you encounter, Gaia grants you the wisdom to overcome.|
4276|You know, something just occurred to me... You saved both me and the Chief's son. That's the sort of stuff heroes do!|
4277|No matter what people say, I can scarcely believe that Brian started out as a person not so different from you.|
4278|Maybe it's a curse, maybe it's not, but I think you'll overcome it either way.|
4279|Well, I agree with what Bentley just said.|
4280|I don't understand the power you and Brian wield, but...|
4281|I believe that somewhere out there in the world, you'll find a solution to your unique problem.|
4282|Hear, hear!|
4283|Hey! If you find any sharp swords or strong shields on your journey, bring a couple back for me!|
4284|Don't forget me! If you find some armor that can really take a beating, bring it back and let me check it out!|
4285|Well, I've got everything I need. The only thing you need to do for me is return safely.|
4286|Hey, Ann! Are you trying to make us look bad?|
4287|Or is it something else?|
4288|What are you tryin' to say, Willie?|
4289|Umm... nothing.|
4290|All right. I know everyone's feeling a bit down, but it's getting late. We should finish our goodbyes.|
4291|Hey, are you all right?|
4292|Hey, I heard that you saved Chief's son.|
4293|Heh... They used to work with me - now they're really something, as expected!|
4294|Well...|
4295|Wow, since when did the Chief become so eloquent?|
4296|I have no idea.|
4297|That Brian guy killed some of my buddies. What if this one turns out like him...|
4298|Shut up, Willy! You keep talkin' that kinda trash and you can kiss off buying from my store.|
4299|I might even drill a few holes in the set of armor I'm making for you.|
4300|Erh... Ok. I'm shutting up.|
4301|Take good care of yourself!|
4302|Come back and visit anytime!|
4303|Farewell!|
4304|Don't forget us!|
4305|I suppose this is goodbye, for now. But remember, Skandia is where you were born, and you'll always be welcome here.|
4306|Take care on your journey.|
4307|Joel and I will miss you.|
4308|Stop knocking! I'm getting back to work now.|
4309|Please... Don't tell Caine about this...|
4310|It hurts, but I've got to get to work.|
4311|This ends here! You won't escape this time.|
4312|To uphold the Shadow Knight's vision, I accept your challenge!|
4313|Oh, Andre. You have potential, but your cowardice holds you back.|
4314|What? A coward like you? Fight me?|
4315|Your twisted future has no place in this world, Shadow Knight!|
4316|How presumptuous of you, to think you're a match for me.|
4317|Hear me, Shadow Knight. Even if I fall here, heroes will rise up to stop you. Evil will not endure!|
4318|Are you sure? I'll be waiting for you to show me.|
4319|You seem awfully proud for besting an illusion.|
4320|A cur like you could never hope to stand against me!|
4321|You and all your loathsome ilk will soon be wiped from the earth by Pandemonium's dark flames!|
4322|We'll blaze a path across the battlefield so you can focus your attention on those demon commanders.|
4323|Rally to me, comrades! Charge!|
4324|Yes sir!|
4325|Kill!|
4326|The first commander's down. Let's keep going!|
4327|Hmm. I've got a bad feeling. Stay sharp, everyone!|
4328|It's an ambush! Beat them back!|
4329|Move ahead; we'll handle things here and catch up with you!|
4330|At last... The final demon awaits in that hall.|
4331|Come on! Nothing can stop us now!|
4332|Listen up, everyone! We have to keep the commander's minions occupied while our agent engages him one-on-one.|
4333|Take your positions! Ready!|
4334|Brilliant! That's the last of the demon commanders. Now, what's next...|
4335|I see the ship of fools is not yet sunk.|
4336|Shadow Knight! You...|
4337|Aaaaaah!|
4338|Commander Andre is taking point! Go support him!|
4339|Alright! With you on our side, victory is ours!|
4340|Justice will triumph, in the end!|
4341|I will... Kill you....|
4342|Are you done spouting your nonsense?|
4343|Words can be so empty. Show me what you're made of with blood and steel!|
4344|Watch out! We've been caught in a pincer attack!|
4345|Leave the group of small bugs to me. You take care of the one behind us!|
4346|Let's go now. There seem to be more beetles coming up. Keep your eyes open.|
4347|Let's carry on. We'll be able to recover the other half of the map.|
4348|It's been a long time, esteemed Chief Amon.|
4349|Tanner... Can we drop the embellished platitudes and just talk normally?|
4350|Haha... I was hoping you'd offer. Neither of us is cut out for the whole rigamarole of diplomatic speeches.|
4351|So, how long are you going to carry on with this nonsense?|
4352|Getting right to the point,  you've been defeated. I'm here to request your unconditional surrender.|
4353|Surrender? I just invited you over for a little chat! Don't start getting presumptuous on me.|
4354|You must have a tiny brain for such a giant. How many of your people have died because of your stubbornness?|
4355|I have something of a wager for you. You propose a contest, and we'll compete. The winner of that contest wins the war!|
4356|You've got yourself a deal. If you manage to win the contest, the New Moon Hunting Grounds will be yours forever.|
4357|I'm not afraid of you! Bring it on and tell me what kind of challenge we'll be competing in.|
4358|Be sure that eagerness won't cause your downfall. The first round will put your hunting skill to the test. Follow me!|
4359|Look at the gap by the road. A bunch of animals will run through there, sooner or later.|
4360|You go to the left, I'll go right. The one who has the most kills at the end wins.|
4361|It seems that, in this regard, you and I are equal.|
4362|Hmph. I hardly even broke a sweat.|
4363|Very well. Since you seem to be a man of many talents, our next challenge will be one of leadership. Come!|
4364|We'll each set up on opposite sides of the region.|
4365|I'll take the offensive, employing strategies to guide my clansmen to attack your base.|
4366|You'll lead your fellow hunters in the defense of your base.|
4367|The catch is, neither of us is allowed to take to the battlefield in-person.|
4368|We'll start as soon as I get back to my base.|
4369|With you on our side, we can't lose. Let's move out!|
4370|Don't underestimate what these bugs can do. When they swarm, it's devastating - not to mention terrifying.|
4371|I was just ambushed out there by the beetles hidden beneath the ground. They got my map, too.|
4372|Hmm... If I'm correct, the bugs should be right beneath us right abouuuuut...now! Watch out!|
4373|Thanks. Let's keep moving. If you're with us, I think we'll come out on top here.|
4374|These beetles seem to hide things they find in piles of dirt. Let's see if the map is buried in one of them!|
4375|No time to relax! Even more beetles seem to be appearing!|
4376|Wait, I'm hurt. Let me step aside and treat my wound first.|
4377|Watch out, here they come again... Argh, my wound...|
4378|Hey! That beetle is carrying the other half of the map!|
4379|Put the two halves together and you can see where the treasure is hidden!|
4380|Leader! Someone claiming to have a secret order wants to see you.|
4381|Humph, this is the price you pay, when you get too greedy.|
4382|We're about to cross a narrow bridge. Be careful and don't fall.|
4383|See the priestess before you start the trials.|
4384|That's the priestess. Wait a minute while I confirm the trials with her.|
4385|Priestess, I brought a friend to help me carry out the trials.|
4386|That is fine. They're not from the village, are they?|
4387|Nah, just a kind-hearted outsider.|
4388|Very well. Before you start the trials, you must prepare a Flower Crown.|
4389|Ok, gotcha.|
4390|Let's gather what we need for the crown! The materials should be around here...|
4391|I might need your help with this.|
4392|You... What did you see?|
4393|I didn't see anything, but you're shivering. What's wrong?|
4394|Don't play dumb with me!|
4395|You must've been intending to distract me, then snatch the jewel right from my hands!|
4396|W-what the heck are you talking about?|
4397|Hey! Wait... John, what are you doing?|
4398|What is it, John? Did something happen?|
4399|Ah! I forgot to tell you, today's my last day! I'm gonna be heading back to the countryside to get married.|
4400|Hey, be happy for me! After all these years, I'm finally tying the knot!|
4401|Ah, John! Perfect timing. I've got a big favor to ask of you.|
4402|Tomorrow's my daughter's birthday, and I promised her that I'd be there to celebrate it this year, for sure.|
4403|Sooo...would you work my shift for me tomorrow? Pretty pleeeease?|
4404|Let's leave our jobs in the mine and move in together!|
4405|I... I... Uh...even if you say so, I--|
4406|Haha! Y'know, you're cute when you get all panicky.|
4407|Just leave everything to me, okay? You can trust me...|
4408|Hey... Did you hear that?|
4409|I didn't hear nothin'. You've been underground too long; startin' to hear things now.|
4410|It can't be... No, I have to check it out!|
4411|What's gotten into you? Hey! Wait for me!|
4412|John! Calm down!|
4413|What are you trying to do?|
4414|John, wake up! Do you know what you've been doing?|
4415|Daddy, daddy! Where are you going?|
4416|Daddy's going to work so we can get enough money to get a doctor to heal mommy, okay?|
4417|You have to stay home and look after mommy, okay?|
4418|Okay, daddy! Come back soon!|
4419|It's a promise, then! I'll be back soon.|
4420|John, are you all right? You're shivering all over! Are you sick?|
4421|What have I done? Kill me...kill me now!|
4422|Intruders detected!|
4423|Shoot to kill!|
4424|You don't belong here!|
4425|Don't think you're getting out alive!|
4426|You... No one can take this away from me!|
4427|No one can ever know.|
4428|Reinhardt...or should I call you the Shadow Knight now? To what do I owe this meeting?|
4429|It's been a long time, Hazel.|
4430|Is something wrong? What's with that pained look? Is it so bad to meet with an old friend?|
4431|No, it's just...I didn't realize how long it had been.|
4432|Heh...always playing hard-to-get, just like old times.|
4433|Be at ease. It's not my intent make things difficult for you today.|
4434|There are more important things I must tend to.|
4435|I can assume you don't wish to cause trouble for me either, correct?|
4436|......|
4437|Well...you've got that right.|
4438|You were once... Well, anyway, I won't stand in your way...|
4439|A wise decision, Hazel. You always were bright.|
4440|Now, stand aside.|
4441|You think an elemental field will stop me?|
4442|Excellent! I have the tome.|
4443|Now, we must unravel the book's secrets. Tell me, Miles, where does the Cube of Gaia sleep?|
4444|I... I...|
4445|You really have changed...|
4446|What happened to you these past few years?|
4447|Believe me, you're better off not knowing.|
4448|Thank you for helping me. Shall we be off?|
4449|At least tell me... Why did you steal this spellbook?|
4450|I don't need to explain myself to you, Hazel.|
4451|You're smart. It shouldn't be too hard for you to figure out what I intend to do with this tome.|
4452|I've never read your mind, and I don't plan to try it now.|
4453|I want to hear you tell me in your own words.|
4454|Enough!|
4455|You're dangerously close to crossing the line, Hazel.|
4456|The line we both agreed on.|
4457|Sorry... I was careless.|
4458|Very well. I'm off, then.|
4459|Oh, and Hazel...don't forget the oath you've sworn.|
4460|I don't think I could, even if I wanted to.|
4461|Careful now! Something's going on up ahead.|
4462|Ah, I'm finally free...and so hungry. Can someone help?|
4463|Well, I've been saved...but by whom?|
4464|I'm going to make it! But...who's helping me?|
4465|John, you...|
4466|Why?|
4467|I ran into a little girl yesterday...|
4468|And? Did you eat her yet?|
4469|Nope; she ate my heart.|
4470|I wish I knew how to ease your sorrow.|
4471|When it comes to choice cuts, there's no beating the tenderloin.|
4472|Just the right amount of fat; the meat practically melts in your mouth!|
4473|I'm more about the thighs.|
4474|A good thigh is all about locking the juices in the meat for flavor.|
4475|And you? What's your favorite cut of meat?|
4476|Ah, it's gotta be a good rump roast for me. That taste...|
4477|Hmm...|
4478|Uh...|
4479|I've been standing here so long, my legs are killing me.|
4480|Stop with the complainin'. We'll find something fun to do once the shift is over.|
4481|It sounds like you've got a new dining option in mind.|
4482|Aye; not long ago, I found a small village to the south. Heh heh...|
4483|Oooooh, sounds exciting!|
4484|What'll I do now? I angered the Fallen Sprites...|
4485|Such an important ceremony, interrupted...|
4486|Where did all these children of the Grass Kingdom come from?|
4487|What a nightmare. All those villagers still trapped inside!|
4488|Those little Grasslings are so cute! They light up!|
4489|Help! Someone save my child!|
4490|Mooom! Help me mom!|
4491|Thank you so much!|
4492|Thank you. I hope you can save those still trapped inside too.|
4493|Princess, are you causing trouble again? What is it this time?|
4494|Please, save the princess. She's trapped inside.|
4495|Ohhh, don't be like that, Princess. Apologize to them.|
4496|There you go, causing trouble again. I swear, you're like a natural disaster.|
4497|I don't wanna hear that from someone who starts fires everywhere she goes!|
4498|Remember last time? You tried to flame-broil the Princess of Sealand!|
4499|Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!|
4500|No!|
4501|Fantastic! You actually defeated the Corrupted Sprite!|
4502|I didn't think this problem could be patched up so quickly.|
4503|A cheer for the hero!|
4504|I'm your biggest faaaaan!|
4505|I need their autograph!|
4506|What a monstrous fighter!|
4507|Good. Everyone's here.|
4508|Your Majesty, I, Goliath, will win this competition for you, and for the pride of the Makar!|
4509|Go, my warrior.|
4510|Ahh! Ahh... Ahhh!|
4511|Ewwwww, so dirty! Get away from me!|
4512|Ha ha, soon this Small Grassling will be corrupted!|
4513|I've all but won. Just accept the corruption.|
4514|Gosh, I'm so sleepy. I think I'll just go over there and get a little shut-eye.|
4515|Hey you! Yeah, the short one. Get over here, would you?|
4516|Do you remember the password?|
4517|You don't know it? Gah, I should've known better than to depend on a Dwarf's memory!|
4518|Oh wait, I remember now! It's "Dwarves have short legs."|
4519|It came back to me when I saw you just now.|
4520|I was gonna ask you for the password, but you just kept hesitating.|
4521|Well, good thing seeing you jogged my memory! I amaze myself all the time.|
4522|Stoooop! What's the password?|
4523|Correct! You may pass.|
4524|Eh? Don't know the password? Who are you?|
4525|You can go take a rest over there, Centurion.|
4526|Agh...darn...|
4527|I, Mummer, do hereby accept my defeat.|
4528|So...no one wants these bugs in the village. Any suggestions on dealing with them?|
4529|Let's collect Aromatic Spider eggs, then milk them for venom to poison the bugs!|
4530|If we have someone gather silk from the spider queen, we can trap the bugs!|
4531|We need someone to GET the spider eggs and silk, and someone to make a net...|
4532|So... Who's volunteering to go?|
4533|Even the second prince...|
4534|This is some kind of joke, right?|
4535|Well...|
4536|Things don't look good...|
4537|Prince! Are you ok?|
4538|I hope you're ready, midget. I'll tear you apart!|
4539|Throw everything you have at me! I won't give you the same mercies as Goliath.|
4540|Ah... I feel a surge of strength...|
4541|Grrr... This pain... But for the honor of the Makar, I must withstand it!|
4542|I hope you're ready to die!|
4543|You Makar...dumb as you are bold.|
4544|Why don't you bluster on about honor and glory some more, you mewling cats?|
4545|Your prince sold you out for power. Drink it in -  your so-called "honor"!|
4546|That's enough of this!|
4547|Listen up, Leo Ryan.|
4548|Your son has been poisoned. If you want the antidote, you and your people will leave this grassland.|
4549|We will be rulers of the prairie!|
4550|Are you done spouting this nonsense?|
4551|Ah, you...|
4552|I admire your gall, to threaten me on my own land.|
4553|Hurry back to your master and bring us the antidote. Otherwise, we will annex all Gnome territory.|
4554|Curses! Remember this: when you mess with Gnomes, you're gonna come up short!|
4555|Everyone, head back. Para, go summon the tribal elders and faction leaders for a conference.|
4556|Yes, father.|
4557|Ah! Where did all these Gnomes come from?|
4558|Get out of our territory, short-stuff!|
4559|You're not welcome here, greenfaces!|
4560|Yes, just keep shouting, you witless beasts!|
4561|Just flail around with a shovel and the spiders will come. So...any volunteers?|
4562|Hey! You have to tell me why you want to pass.|
4563|You want to go through, but not tell us anything? Are you daft?|
4564|It's great to feel the sunlight again!|
4565|#&7$Merchant's Assistant##br#
"Huh... Huh... Huff... I've run so far... I'm exhausted..." #npc$$829$1#

|
4566|Huh... Huh... Huff... I can't feel my legs anymore... Huff...|
4567|I ran all the way to bring these mushrooms back. What's next?|
4568|...|
4569|An enemy approaches! At the ready, comrades!|
4570|Gnomes?|
4571|Good job on your shift today.|
4572|Hey, have you seen a wild wolf before? They're terrifying!|
4573|Agreed. But what need would professional guards have of wolves?|
4574|Who knows? But it's not like anyone's gonna sneak past on MY watch!|
4575|Why do you think the wolves don't try to pass by here?|
4576|Well, you see those flowers across the way?|
4577|Their pollen blocks a wolf's sense of smell, so they don't roam where the flowers grow.|
4578|If I covered myself in pollen, no wolf would dare mess with me!|
4579|Leave this up to us. We won't let the monsters escape.|
4580|Curses! These Rotten Sprouts are proving difficult.|
4581|Hoo, that was a close one.|
4582|The altar is up ahead. Be careful.|
4583|Hold it right there! How dare you barge into my treasure room!|
4584|Even my own men wouldn't have the chutzpah! I'm going to boil you alive, thief!|
4585|......|
4586|I... I lost...|
4587|Very well. I shall honor the promise. You may have the Hunting Grounds.|
4588|Amon...I think you're misunderstanding me.|
4589|I don't want to take the hunting ground from you.|
4590|Oh? So you're saying...|
4591|I want both our sides to stop fighting, and to share the Hunting Grounds.|
4592|This is...|
4593|What say you, Chief Amon? I'll wait for your response.|
4594|If you don't like that arrangement, my hunters won't run from a fight - you know that much.|
4595|But that doesn't benefit either of us, really. Think it over.|
4596|All right. I accept your terms.|
4597|Excellent. You won't regret this decision, Chief Amon.|
4598|Listen up, folks.|
4599|From now on, you can't fight with the Giants here. Also, we'll be instituting a hunting quota.|
4600|Offenders will have to answer to me.|
4601|Understood!|
4602|If that's the word from the top, we're on board.|
4603|Listen, my people. You shall not attack or harass these hunters, or poach their quarries.|
4604|Yes...|
4605|Oh...|
4606|Glad to hear it, Amon. I look forward to hunting with you someday.|
4607|Let's be off now.|
4608|This is the best you could come up with?|
4609|Well then, let's begin!|
4610|Are you the one with a secret order for me?|
4611|You're from Helonia? Didn't expect you'd come all the way out here.|
4612|You... I won't let you take Selena away!|
4613|Hurry, hurry! There isn't much time.|
4614|Oof. It's so heavy.|
4615|Everything's installed and armed, sir!|
4616|I'm so nervous. What do we do if the pirates come back?|
4617|Less talk, more work; get on it!|
4618|Everything's ready. Let's get moving!|
4619|Let's roll!|
4620|This shipment is really important to the Chamber of Commerce, you know.|
4621|There are many rare antiques and curios gathered here.|
4622|If this shipment doesn't make it back, the losses to the Chamber of Commerce will be catastrophic.|
4623|Huh? I hear footsteps!|
4624|Are the pirates be coming back?|
4625|Aren't those the pirates who got away?|
4626|Why'd they have to come back now?|
4627|Did they catch wind of our plan?|
4628|Who's there?!|
4629|Oy, we've got ourselves some thieves!|
4630|Yikes! What are we gonna do?|
4631|Help! We're gonna die!|
4632|This place has been locked down. Leave, and don't try my patience.|
4633|It's you... Hmph. I won't give you anything!|
4634|Ah! Help! Help me!|
4635|Caroline!|
4636|You dare attack my master? Die!|
4637|Wait...what have I done...|
4638|You again! I warned you - now you'll face my wrath!|
4639|What's this? No! My power...!|
4640|Blast it...stop running! I won't let you get away!|
4641|Sorry to keep you waiting, everyone.|
4642|I've prepared some small gifts for you all; I hope you like them.|
4643|I never would've guessed you'd be the last to fight me. Do you really think you can win?|
4644|After all your tricks, you still want to give a speech? Cut it out and start fighting!|
4645|Well, let's not mince words, then. Let the fight begin!|
4646|Wow!|
4647|Totally amazing!|
4648|Wooo! Go Montero, you're my idol!|
4649|Montero's got this win all tied up.|
4650|Go, Augustus Mk. VII!|
4651|Come! Give us a rousing match!|
4652|Be good and just disappear, John. Don't interfere with my revival!|
4653|Hey! Who are you, slinking around here?!|
4654|Grrrraaaaooooooow!|
4655|For Small Magic|
4656|For Small Magic|
4657|For Small Magic|
4658|Annie, daddy won't be able to keep his promise to you. I'm sorry...|
4659|Great. Are you all right?|
4660|What a weakling, defeated by these rustlers...|
4661|Don't say that. The Red Colt Clan's strength is legendary.|
4662|We were too careless, and they took advantage of that to stage a night raid.|
4663|Can't deny that Zibo is really strong.|
4664|I heard Zibo punched one guy, and like five guys flew backward!|
4665|It looks like we've got a tough battle ahead of us.|
4666|Let us take care of things. You just worry about healing up.|
4667|Feh. I'm pretty strong - I'll send this Zibo chump flyin'!|
4668|As soon as we load up these supplies, we'll catch up with you.|
4669|Let's go! There are plenty of Red Colt clansmen for everyone!|
4670|Let's give those bandits hell!|
4671|We'll send a clear message to the Red Colt Clan: mess with us, and we'll burn you.|
4672|The enemies have got backup comin' in! Leave this post to us - we'll stop 'em cold!|
4673|Please, go up there and rescue the hostages together!|
4674|Follow me and I'll show you what I can do!|
4675|Gyahahaha! Just ran with the tails between their legs, didn't they?|
4676|You really came for us!|
4677|When we're ready, we'll come and back you up.|
4678|Weird. Where'd my weapon go?|
4679|Let's meet up with my brothers!|
4680|There's plenty of wine here. No one will miss a few sips, right?|
4681|*hic* I think I drank tew much...|
4682|Don't tell my brother I drank some'a the wine.|
4683|Hey...why's your face all red?|
4684|Uh...what, really? I dunno what you're talkin' about.|
4685|It must be because I put so much effort into everything I do!|
4686|Whoa... Whoa... Whoooaaaah!|
4687|Hear me, my legion! We march against the lowly and treacherous Gnomes!|
4688|They have stained our honor. They have spurned our king's generosity!|
4689|Today, the Lion's Roar Army will extract a toll in blood, and restore our honor!|
4690|Uh...testing, testing. This is Stephanie here. Can you hear me?|
4691|Great! Got a clear signal. Have you taken a look at the operator's panel?|
4692|You should see three new skills you can use.|
4693|The first is the Pulse Wave - use it to attack all enemies on a line.|
4694|Second is the Railgun, which is effective against aerial enemies.|
4695|Third is the Magnetostatic Field, and that can fry both grounded and aerial enemies!|
4696|Hey...those rogue robots seem like they're coming for us!|
4697|Okay, I leave everything in your hands!|
4698|We'll be around. If anything goes south, we'll let you know immediately.|
4699|Eh? The attack stopped?|
4700|No, something's wrong. I've got a strange reading on my detector...|
4701|If I didn't know any better, I'd say...|
4702|Yeowza!|
4703|It's a giant robot!|
4704|Once these parts are installed, we can really calibrate this turret.|
4705|Great! Before that big guy attacks, check your equipment and skills again.|
4706|You ready? Well, I hope so, 'cause Mr. Big is charging on over!|
4707|You... you really did it! I never doubted you for a second.|
4708|Walker should send someone back to let the fortress know our status.|
4709|Why don't you report to Walker first? We'll stay behind and clean up the mess.|
4710|Woo-ah!|
4711|We won!|
4712|Dangerous target detected... Executing elimination protocol.|

4717|We do this together! Kill them!|
4718|Kill! Kill! Kill!|
4719|Help! Save me!|
4720|You're not getting through that easily! Take this!|
4721|Please... You have to rescue the sprites...|
4722|My hand is wounded, so I can't go into the water and pick the flowers.|
4723|Why can't I take the flower? It it 'cause I'm a kid and grown-ups don't think I can do anything?|
4724|Priestess, I've prepared the Flower Crown. Can we begin the trials?|
4725|And a finely-woven crown it is. I have a feeling you'll do well.|
4726|Now, prepare to face the trials! May the sprites' blessings be upon you.|
4727|Ok, I'll do my best. Let's go!|
4728|It's so quiet. Have the trials started, yet?|
4729|The road seems to be blocked. What should I do?|
4730|There are three types, with different colors and shapes. Shouldn't be too hard.|
4731|I'm so nervous... I don't know what the trials have in store for us.|
4732|Yesss! We can finally accept the blessings of the Sprites. Let's go!|
4733|Sprite, I wasn't able to beat the doppelganger challenge. Can I still pass?|
4734|System failure. Executing self-destruct program...|
4735|You alone may not be strong enough, but finding help in others - that, too, is a kind of strength.|
4736|I think SOMEONE was helping himself to the wine while we weren't looking.|
4737|Forget it... Let's go. Many are waiting on us to rescue them.|
4738|Let's kick those bandits' arses to the moon!|
4739|I didn't expect the Red Colt Clan to mobilize so many fighters.|
4740|Look, it seems like something fishy's going on down there.|
4741|Don't overthink it. Just focus on defeating the ones coming our way.|
4742|Yeah, there's more wine here!|
4743|Is there...usually this much wine in the village?|
4744|Well, that's not important right now. How 'bout a drink!|
4745|What're you doing, brother? Hurry up!|
4746|I'm on my way! Wait for me!|
4747|Are you all right?|
4748|Thanks for asking, chief. We're all right.|
4749|What do you think, brother? Why is there so much wine?|
4750|Emmm? Chief, didn't you have the wine delivered over here?|
4751|Not that I can recall. Why would we need that much?|
4752|Look at all this wine! Oooh, this is a good vintage. And that one has a real aroma!|
4753|Brother, these wines taste a bit strange. I think they may have been drugged.|
4754|Chief! As soon as we'd cracked open the wine, the Red Colt Clan launched an attack!|
4755|Are you telling me the Red Colts delivered that wine?|
4756|I mushta drunk tew much... Feelin' kinda dizzhy...|
4757|...You okay, brother? Are you STILL drinking that wine?|
4758|Ahhh... Ah'm nosh drinkin' nuthin'.|
4759|Brother, he seems to be drunk.|
4760|Truly? At this crucial a juncture?|
4761|You stay here and take care of Kafei.|
4762|Let's go, then. Zibo should be inside.|
4763|Chief! We're ready!|
4764|Chief! We drove all of the Red Colt Clansmen out of the village.|
4765|Chief! Let us go and drive off those bandits!|
4766|Very well! Let's drive the Red Colts out of this village!|
4767|Foolish Red Colts... Eat this!|
4768|Leave this to us and go on ahead!|
4769|Trust us, we'll show those Bandits what we're made of!|
4770|Excellent! Now, we've just gotta deal with Zibo.|
4771|Let's pool our strength and bring this fiend down!|
4772|Death to evil!|
4773|Go! Go! Go!|
4774|Zibo!|
4775|Zibo! Get outta this town!|
4776|Just hurry up and die, bandit!|
4777|It looks like the rumors of Zibo's hardiness weren't just exaggerations.|
4778|If not for you, I doubt we would've been able to best him.|
4779|Ahaha, you're almost as good as me...but not quite there yet.|
4780|Hero of the Wild Eagle Clan!|
4781|What a battle!|
4782|I didn't know the humans had such a wild fighter among them!|
4783|Looks like we can't underestimate them.|
4784|Everybody run!|
4785|No! Stay away!|
4786|Help!|
4787|No... don't come any closer...|
4788|How can this be?|
4789|Don't come after me! Please... go away!|
4790|This world is a restless, agitated place that only water's power can soothe.|
4791|Your body and soul cry out in torment. Let me soothe the pain with eternal sleep!|
4792|Nature exists in balance. With light, darkness; with good, evil.|
4793|I am Shenoute, the dark face of the world. The pain and struggle of life flows from me.|
4794|Do you really think you can break the seal? I shall devour you in darkness!|
4795|The flame of life and hope has departed from me.|
4796|The Master once said if I finish my mission, he would return it to me.|

4799|The Master has commanded me regarding their safekeeping.|
4800|I am Saniemi! Those who trespass on sanctified ground must pay the toll.|
4801|Do you understand the significance of Master choosing me as the Gatekeeper?|
4802|Since my awakening, none have succeeded in entering Ozymand Temple.|
4803|Forget it. I see there is no use in talking with you.|
4804|I, Imadal, am a steadfast wall that shall never be breached!|
4805|Throw yourselves against me and know futility.|
4806|Impossible... In all my time as guardian...|
4807|I have failed you, Master. Please, forgive me.|
4808|I shall show you why I was chosen as the Gatekeeper!|

4835|Oh! Can you see the egg glowing? Truly amazing!|
4836|Such a radiant glow - I never expected something like that!|
4837|C'mon egg, you can do it! Time to come out of your shell!|
4838|It's a real dragon... I can't believe it; I just witnessed history!|
4839|Did Akara ask you to come? We've tried may things, but this egg just won't move.|
4840|Thank you for saving me! I'll help free the others.|

4858|Thanks. I'll drop by and take a look when I have the time.|
4859|Thanks for the hard work!|
4860|I'm fine with what I have right now, but thanks for the heads-up!|
4861|Nice! I just upgraded and I'm in the market for a new set of accessories.|
4862|You're so cool. I hope you have a great day!|
4863|Someone just gave me one of these fliers. How much paper does this shop have?|
4864|Oh! You startled me. I was just...deep in thought, you know?|
4865|Petunia's armor shop? How many people did she hire to hand these out?|
4866|Another one... What, do I get special discount if I collect ten fliers?|
4867|Fewer fliers mean fewer trees cut down. Respect the planet!|
4868|Here, take a look at our fliers. Oh wait...you didn't see anything - or hear anything...|
4869|You already gave me one. I'll just make paper airplanes with any others.|
4870|Didn't I tell you I don't need one? Do you understand words when you hear them?|
4871|Good. Grab your weapon and let's begin.|
4872|Aye aye, Captain Tatius!|
4873|Well then, get ready.|
4874|Soldiers, open the cage door!|
4875|Well done!|
4876|Wow... That was something else.|
4877|That's right... It takes a whole team for us to deal with a beast like this.|
4878|I'll take care of the rest. Go back and report to the Commander.|
4879|Hmm? Something's wrong...|
4880|Yes? This sound... This feeling...|
4881|Stand back, your Holiness!|
4882|It's the Shadow Knight! Everyone, defend the Grand Bishop!|
4883|Ohhh... I feel terrible...|
4884|Great Gaia, defend us this day from darkness, and grant us the courage to face our fears!|
4885|Aah...|
4886|Heh. With your ability, isn't saying the whole incantation more for show, Belenus?|
4887|Even in front of trusted allies, you aren't willing to show your real power...|
4888|Calculated and deceptive - just what I'd expect from Navea's top showman.|
4889|Reinhardt... You know as well as I that those without piety are not granted the Light's blessing.|
4890|Everyone's here - why not tell the whole, sordid tale? Or do you trade exclusively in half-truths?|
4891|Reinhardt, I am truly sorry about your wife. I have not forgotten, even for a day.|
4892|Lying viper!|
4893|You have no right to regret what you turned your back on!|
4894|I called for the greatest priests, healers, and scholars, Reinhardt. None could save her.|
4895|We draw power from the Light, but it does not allow us to cheat mortality.|
4896|Do you still play at blindness to the truth you knew even then?|
4897|The power that rests atop the Sky Tower could have cured her! And yet... you wouldn't...|
4898|This...|
4899|What now? Cat got your tongue? Have you nothing to say in your defense?|
4900|That is true - there exists a bottle of medicine in the tower that can cure any ailment. However...|
4901|It is to be used only in the most dire of situations and only for the benefit of the world; so is it written.|
4902|You're the head of the Church! Your entire mission is to save people's lives and souls!|
4903|This was a person's life, Belenus! Or are you saying some lives have more value than others?|
4904|Even now, I regret that we could do nothing for her.|
4905|But it was the only decision we could make.|
4906|You haven't changed a bit, Belenus.|
4907|It is you who has changed, Reinhardt. Your grief has pulled you from the path of righteousness.|
4908|Hah! Righteousness?!|
4909|I devoted my life's work to righteousness, and I reaped a bitter harvest for my toils!|
4910|Enough of this. I didn't come here to sip tea and debate morality.|
4911|So, why have you come then, Reinhardt?|
4912|I wanted to bring you...a small gift. To show I haven't forgotten you.|
4913|Come forth, you ugly brute.|
4914||
4915||
4916||
4917|Oh Reinhardt, is this truly the path you want to walk? Is there no turning back?|
4918|Hah! I've opened rifts to Pandemonium across this land, and my friends are -dying- to visit.|
4919|Soon, more will come, and my ranks will grow. Make no mistake...|
4920|I will end you, Belenus, but only after I've torn down your Church and this miserable world.|
4921|But for now, I simply must insist you spend some quality time with my friend here.|
4922|What? What's going on with this monster...|
4923|Shadow Knight!|
4924|Turning tail again? Next time you won't escape - I'll pin you on my sword!|
4925|All right - Gus, escort the Grand Bishop out of here. The rest of you are with me. We've a monster to slay!|
4926|You, come with us!|
4927|Finally...|
4928|Everyone is...|
4929|Grand Bishop, are you ok?|
4930|I never could have expected things would turn out this way.|
4931|Gus, send word to all the doctors in the city - we have need of their aid treating the wounded.|
4932|Draw up a list of the fallen so we can notify their families. Tomorrow, I'll hold a city-wide memorial service.|
4933|Yes, Grand Bishop.|
4934|Grand Bishop... I never thought the Shadow Knight would attack Navea head-on. I've failed in my duty.|
4935|Do not blame yourself, Andre. Reinhardt wields an incredible power. There was nothing you could have done.|
4936|Next time, I'll get him for sure.|
4937|There's nothing else you can do here. Go and rest.|
4938|Yes? Why are you still here?|
4939|You don't want to wait here all day, do you?|
4940|As I recall, you have other tasks to take care of.|
4941|I wish being the Templar Commander gave me as much free time as you seem to have.|
4942|Please stop running around right here.|
4943|Enough!|
4944|That's gross, but I can't look away...|
4945|Where did that monster come from?|
4946|So, how are we going to deal with this thing?|
4947|Reinhardt... Are you...|
4948|Reinhardt...|
4949|All right, follow me, Grand Bishop. But not too close - keep a safe distance.|
4950|How are you faring, comrades?|
4951|We've...seen better days.|
4952|C'mon, Master Gus...it's just too sad...|
4953|Even now, I still feel dizzy.|
4954|At least you still have your spirit. We'll extend this week's ceremony so all can receive the Light's blessing.|
4955|C'mon, you don't have to do that just for our sake...|
4956|You're making my head hurt even more now...|
4957|Reinhardt, you really disappointed me... Light of Gaia, bless your people and empower them.|
4958|I've already subdued this monster. Andre, I'll let you take it from here.|
4959|All right. Look alive, comrades, let's go!|
4960|There's no time to waste, and lots of Sarpa on the way. It's up to you to deal with them.|
4961|While you throw yourself into battle, I'll find an opportunity to place the explosives.|
4962|I know your plans - "He" told me all about them.|
4963|A human who hates Humans... He gave us the power of Spring Water and with it, an opportunity.|
4964|This water is my people's future, and I will kill you to protect this place!|
4965|Hmm. Something feels wrong. There's something strange in the air!|
4966|You look like you have no shortage of energy, Alex.|
4967|The Shadow Knight! What are you doing here?!|
4968|Why ask questions to which you already know the answer?|
4969|Ah, Alex... I can admire your resolve. Why not join me? Stand at my side as we wipe clean the slate of history.|
4970|I...|
4971|N-no! No way!|
4972|I have taken the Templar's vow, and my service is to the light, never to the dark!|
4973|A pity, that. You would've made a fine commander. When next we meet, it will be as foes.|
4974|Farewell, you doctrine-addled lambs. Cherish your lives, while they last.|
4975|Terrible, just terrible...|
4976|Hey!|
4977|I can see you're confused, mortal. But don't be ashamed - I've been confused before.|
4978|Then, I had a revelation - this world is filled with spirits both good and evil, and all heed the pull of fate.|
4979|So...|
4980|You are much more interesting than I expected. Perhaps I should keep a closer eye on you.|
4981|It is time to face your destiny! Do not be afraid - death lasts only a moment!|
4982|It's the Wrathborne Soul! You did it! I knew you would!|
4983|My long imprisonment is finally over. You must have defeated the demons who took up residence here.|
4984|Okay, since everything's done, we should get out of here!|
4985|Uwooo...more power...|
4986|Evolve...evolve...|
4987|Human... You should not have come.|
4988|Or... Have you come to surrender?|
4989|Well, then, we must see if you're qualified! Come here!|
4990|The life energy in the Oblitus Wood has strengthened us, evolving us into greater beings.|
4991|And you, detestable fool. You share our nature, but you constantly dashing our hopes!|
4992|That will cease today, as I finish you off right here. Then, we can grow unchecked!|
4993|Come, show me what you've got!|
4994|You...succeeded?|
4995|I knew you could do it!|
4996|I knew you were better than the average human, but seeing you defeat that demon was truly impressive.|
4997|You saved our village chief and defeated the monster. The citizens of Tafay are in your debt.|
4998|If you hadn't shown up when you did, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to return to Tafay Village.|
4999|Finally, things have been taken care of...|
5000|Congratulations on completing the trials and summoning your Eidolon. You'll find a reward attached to this message.

Continue collecting Eidolon Energy and summoning more of these powerful spirits - hopefully, they'll deem you worthy and join your team!|

5030|Hmm... Well, in my opinion...|
5031|Aaaand thank you for those insights, Tom! It looks like Augustus Mk.VII has emerged victorious!|
5032|It looks like the competition's fierce out there! Will any of these heroic hopefuls be able to carve out a name for themselves?|

#&53$You see a scholarly-looking man lying dead. The blood from his wound has already dried.# #clean$1#|

"I feel a profound sadness over what happened to the Church's scholar." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$ Mason##br#
"Who is this Shadow Knight, anyway? No one from these parts has ever heard of him, but it seems those from the Church know more than they're letting on." #npc$$1$1#|
5045|#&7$ Nate##br#
"We weren't able to save Miles; that's all the more reason to redouble our efforts to save Maggie, his star pupil. Problem is, no one knows where she is. #npc$$1$1#|
5046|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"He recruited a small army of people to help him, and got his hands on the Cube of Gaia, too. What's his game exactly, this Shadow Knight?" #npc$$1$1#|
5047|#&7$Maggie##br#
"..."#npc$$1$1#|
5048|#&7$Floyd##br#
"I should've been more cautious. But who would've expected Miles' star pupil to be one of the Shadow Knight's lackeys?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"Shadow Knight... Does your hatred for us truly run so deep?"#br##br#
#&53$It's difficult to tell whether Floyd's slight trembling is from anger or sadness.##npc$$1$1#|

"In addition to traditional energy sources, we should make it be able to run on magical energy too. That way, the robot could run even longer without recharging." #npcs85h+70$$1$1#|

"Given my position, I shouldn't grouse about it, but I'm also really curious why the Church hasn't sent any Templars."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"In fact, I heard that several Templars were recently dispatched to Candeo Marsh."#npc$$1$1#|
5078|#&7$Rachel##br#
"I'm here right now, but my heart is always with my team. After I finish gathering supplies, I'm going back to support them." #npc$$1$1#|
5079|#&7$Tanner##br#
"The giants and the hunters have been feuding over these hunting grounds for...ages now, really." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"But lately, the fighting has been unusually intense. I hope my brother is out there, so we can put our heads together and lead this outfit." #npc$$1$1#|
5080|#&7$Roger##br#
"This time, I think Tanner ought to lead the band himself. Tell him to think of it as on-the-job training." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"It's good I was with Juno, though. If he'd been scouting on his own, that monster would've gotten him for sure." #br##br#
#&53$Roger looks down at his wounds, shaking his head.# #npc$$1$1#|
5081|#&7$Juno##br#
"Roger totally saved my bacon, but he got hurt helping me. Now, I want to do my part to help him." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"C'mon Juno, pull yourself together! But...I saw the ghost that lurks here with my own eyes. Just thinking about it gives me the willies! #npc$$1$1#|
5082|#&7$Maya##br#
"Those Avians annoy me to no end. If it wasn't for that magical weapon, I'd never stay in such an awful place." #npc$$1$1#|
5083|#&7$Robinson##br#
"I always thought the Cube of Gaia was just some myth. Who would have guessed it was real?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"But it is real, and it's definitely got some kind of incredible power.  We can't let that guy have his way with it. We have to stop him."#npc$$1$1#|
5084|#&7$Maya##br#
#&53$Maya nods her head, a mysterious smile playing at her lips.# #npc$$1$1#|
5085|#&7$Village Hunter##br#
"Why don't you send for more capable people?" #npc$$1$1#|
5086|#&7$Village Woman##br#
"We've been at odds with the giants over possession of the hunting grounds for so long, I don't even remember when the fighting started." #npc$$1$1#|
5087|#&7$Anya##br#
"Hey there! Haven't seen you around the last few days. Something's different about you, I can tell. It's like your spirit is stronger, somehow. Just like that man."#npc$$1$1#|
5088|#&7$Alex##br#
"Many years ago, I led an attack against the Corpser Bandits. Since then, I've always been on the lookout for those henchmen who escaped." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Several of the murders around Candeo Marsh bear signs of their methods." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Perhaps that man's involvement isn't altogether unlikely..." #npc$$1$1#|
5089|#&7$Penny##br#
"Something was left behind at the scene of each murder, and you're in charge of collecting the evidence. Bring anything suspicious to me for analysis." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I have my doubts about what went down. Some people are saying 'Vampires!', but don't be so quick to believe the rumors." #npc$$1$1#|
5090|#&7$Jeffery##br#
"I thought the Church was going to send an exorcist to drive out the demons. What's with this group of Templars and researchers?"#npc$$1$1#|
5091|#&7$Will##br#
"To think it could be a vampire is quite unsettling. But please, watch your step while out in the marshes. If you die off the beaten path, we may never find the body." #npc$$1$1#|
5092|#&7$Susanna##br#
"My poor husband; he's been dead so long, but the Templars have just now come to investigate."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Susanna##br#
"But what can they do for me? Even if they slay this...creature, it won't bring him back." #npc$$1$1#|
5093|#&7$Yolanda##br#
"Sometimes, I think back to that day, as Lucas headed out of Helonia. We held each other close on the porch before he left. It wasn't the first time he'd taken a long trip, but I had a strange feeling that day, as he passed beyond the horizon." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Yolanda##br#
"I never thought that that embrace would be the last time I felt his warmth." Yolanda sighs with the weight of her memories. #npc$$1$1#|
5094|#&7$Mark##br#
"It used to be that Alex would always head up the team, so why is Anya in charge this time?"#npc$$821$1#|
5095|#&7$Henry##br#
"Take the evidence you need, and leave here as soon as possible." #npc$$1$1#|
5096|#&7$Mia##br#
"Do you think that running into one of your kind here is fate, or merely coincidence?" #br##br#
#&53$Mia gives a hint of a smile.# #npc$$1$1#|
5097|#&7$Archie##br#
"We've been stationed in the marshes for some time now, and we're pretty sure that the marshes are changing under the influence of some outside force. Except for the unicorns. Ah, those unicorns are so majestic!" #npcs85h+70$$1$1#|
5098|#&7$Brennan##br#
"I feel like everything here wants to eat me. Is this research really important enough to risk life and limb over?" #npc$$1$1#|
5099|#&7$Jalen##br#
"A private research think-tank that's already been here for some time is likely privy to some information that the Church is not." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"Furthermore, even though they lack a proper laboratory, they've brought more than enough to eke out the secrets of this place." #npc$$1$1#|
5100|#&7$Oswald##br#
"Lucas should've been straight with us and reported what he knew, instead of thinking he could resolve things by himself." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Oswald##br#
"The last time I saw him, he'd just come back from Awlstone Forest, saying there were questions he needed answers to. Then he took off again. Hasn't been back since." #npc$$1$1#|
5101|#&7$Sarpa Leader##br#
"Land-dweller! This territory belongs to the Sarpa. Begone!"#npcs80h-30$$1$1#|
5102|#&7$Alex##br#
"All the time I was in Candetonn, I'd been praying he wouldn't drag the Corpser Bandits into this too. You can imagine my relief at how things turned out." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Alex##br#
"But here, in Candeo Core, I found that he harbors far greater ambitions..." #npc$$1$1#|
5103|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
#&53$Leo lowers his head, his fiery gaze resting intently on you. He seems to be considering something important.# #M037040$Leo Ryan$821$1#|

"If you were not summoned by His Majesty, I must ask you to leave." #M009030$Leo's Bodyguard$821$1#|

5106|#&7$Palo's Confidant##br#
"His Majesty the prince is resting right now. If there's nothing I can help you with, I bid you good day." #npc$$1$1#|
5107|#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"Power is the first and last word in life. What more is there to say?" #M009100$Para Ryan$821$1#|
5108|Odum Ryan|
5109|#&7$Shalen##br#
"The one I used to serve, I admired for more than mere strength or skill." #M038020$Shalen$821$1#|
5110|#&7$Baird##br#
"This competition decides who shall be our next leader, but that traitor Micha is afraid he won't win. That's why he's trying to start an uprising in the name of the third prince." #M009020$Baird$821$1#|
5111|Micha|
5112|#&7$Tatiana##br#
"I will wait here until Odum returns. However, I still must get through these difficult times." #M038050$Tatiana$821$1#|
5113|#&7$Tiny##br#
#&53$Blood seeps from Tiny's wound. His eyes are closed, and his face has already lost much of its color.#  #npc$$502$1#|
5114|#&7$Kadeshar##br#
"Many sacred battles have been fought in the Leyline Arena. The warrior who overcomes all will become our new king." #M009030$Kadeshar$821$1#

#&7$Kadeshar##br#
"He will raise his weapon to the sky with a mighty shout, that all may celebrate his glory." #M009030$Kadeshar$821$1#|
5115|#&7$Pascal##br#
"I can proudly call myself one of the finest artisans of the Ventos Tribe. However, this is the first time I've forged a weapon for a human." #M038040$Pascal$821$1#|
5116|#&7$Shep##br#
"Our weapons are some of the finest in the land, but to make one the right size for a human, we'll have to make something like what our young ones use to practice their fortification." #M037020$Shep$821$1#|
5117|#&7$Kali##br#
"Are you hurt? If your injuries aren't too bad, perhaps you can wait while I tend to those most in need of healing." #M038030$Kali$821$1#|
5118|#&7$Shashek##br#
"I've been stationed here for a long time; a longer time than you've walked this earth, I'd wager." #M015010$Shashek$821$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"Long ago, I saw a proud warrior rise to kingship. Now, it seems like he's on the verge of abdicating the throne." #M015010$Shashek$821$1#|
5119|#&7$Adonis##br#
"Those who have been trained will receive no mercy from me. How else would you understand the value of what you have learned?" #M015030$Adonis$821$1#|
5120|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Since when did gnomes start showing such chutzpah? They'll pay for this, mark my word." #M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
5121|#&7$Ike##br#
"These Gnomes are a crafty lot. They set all this up and caused a clamor on the battlefield; now we're caught up in whatever scheme they're hatching." #M009080$Ike$821$1#|
5122|#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"I can't believe we're stuck here at such a critical juncture!" Para shouts impatiently. #M009100$Para Ryan$826$1# 

#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"Don't worry about me - find the antidote first! With the condition my brother is in, I fear he won't last too long without treatment. I'll get out by myself." #M009100$Para Ryan$828$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod affirmatively. The most important thing right now is to press deeper into the temple and find those medicinal herbs. #char$$806:0$0# 

#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"Listen to me, %n%. Although the temple has been sealed, monsters #br# may still lurk in the area. There may still be active traps #br# as well, so be watchful and attentive." #M009100$Para Ryan$821$1#|

5135|#&7$Leto##br#
"Do you want good armor? Cheap armor? Well too bad, quality dinnae come cheap, kiddo. But I've got gear that'll last you through a rain'a drake's fire, so don't be stingy now." #npc$$821$1#|

"Today, we end this nightmare that has plagued our land. Templars, bring your weapons to the ready!"#npc$$1$1#|
5150|#&7$Sheila##br#
"Joel's always getting into mischief. If he was half as well-behaved as Theia, he'd spare me quite a few premature grey hairs." #npc$$1$1#|
5151|#&7$York##br#
"It's not hard for even untrained eyes to notice - the forest and the sea have changed recently, compared to how they used to be." #npc$$1$1#|
5152|#&7$Theia##br#
"My brother's always runnin' around and he won't listen to nobody. What'll happen if he runs into danger?"#npc$$1$1#|
5153|#&7$Anita##br#
"Oh! Is there something I can help you with?" #npc$$1$1#|
5154|#&7$Corey##br#
"With a quality weapon at your side, those woodland creatures won't be a mach for you." #npc$$1$1#|
5155|#&7$Betsy##br#
"Don't skimp on spending when it comes to armor. You'll wear it every day, and it'll save your life plenty of times. Just consider good gear a tool of your trade." #npc$$1$1#|
5156|#&7$Warren##br#
"Looking for some odd jobs, %n%? You could always come help me out at the lighthouse, if you want to supplement your adventurer's income, heh heh!" #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Warren##br#
"Right now, I'm hard-pressed for time to teach you anything. Maybe once the walruses are back to their usual selves, I'll have more room to breathe. How's that sound?" #npc$$1$1#|
5157|#&7$Caine##br#
"It's nice and relaxing to not have to work. All young folks seem to think about these days is money, money, money. Money's just a tool - they ought to think in terms of how they want to live life." #npc$$1$1#|

Brett|
5159|#&7$Cal##br#
"Caine doesn't mince words when he talks, but he actually does care a lot about people." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"You may have wondered, 'Why are his lumberjacks so lazy?" #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"It's because when he finds a talented worker, he'll help them land a better job, even if it's not with him. Cal smiles knowingly. #npc$$1$1#|
5160|#&7$Bentley##br#
"Aside from the Forest Guards, the only ones who pass through here are merchants en-route to Helonia or the port. Seeing Brian with a child in tow gives me some cause for concern." #npc$$1$1#|
5161|#&7$Elena##br#
"The staff's busted - not really much use now. I could carve a new one, but I'd still need to gather energy from the gems." #npc$$1$1#|
5162|#&7$Flower##br#
"Y'know, we tried to analyze the remaining runes before, but what we translated seemed to be some kinda ancient myth. At the time, we were just like, 'Well, that's quaint.'" #npc$$1$1#

"I'm just an assistant, after all. They don't pay me the big bucks around here!" #npc$$1$1#|
5163|#&7$Willie##br#
"Before, patrolling the forest just meant walking a route, spending a bit of time at each stop, once in the morning and once in the evening, and that was that." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Willie##br#
"Now, the forest is choc-a-block with beasts and monsters. We can't even drive off this flock of Sunbirds." #npc$$1$1#|
5164|#&7$Larry##br#
"Just a couple days ago, my field was torn up by beasts. When I was trying to make some cash to re-plant it, my wallet was stolen. Man, when Lady Luck left me, she gave a swift kick to the balls on her way out." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Larry##br#
"And just recently, my wares were stolen. But it wasn't enough to just steal my stuff; the thieves had to beat me up too." #npc$$1$1#|
5165|#&7$Kane##br#
"What could have happened to make Brian like that? The only thing that comes to mind is a powerful curse..." #npc$$1$1#|

"B-Brian turned really scary! This isn't fun anymore..." #npc$$1$1#|
5167|#&7$York##br#
"I'm sorry you got caught up in all of this, %n%. I'm grateful to you for saving my son, but... York seems to hesitate. #npc$$1$1#|

"I'm so glad that Joel is alright. If you hadn't come along, who could've stopped Brian?" #npc$$1$1#|
5169|#&7$Elena##br#
"I don't mean to add to your worries, but you should know that before Brian went mad, he came to me asking for help." #npc$$1$1#|
5170|#&7$Kane##br#
Kane looks at you, slowly shaking his head. Even though you defeated Brian, he still seems to eye you with caution. #npc$$1$1#|

5177|#&7$Paul##br#
"I'm Paul, and I loooove food. I love it so much, I became a chef! It might be a loss for my waistline, but it's a victory for the taste buds! Cooking requires many ingredients, though.

5179|Hoo-whee, what a match! Personally, I think that these competitors have demonstrated--|

5187|#&7$Osman##br#
"The power is ultimately in the hands of the combatant, but a good weapon lets them fully express that skill, like an artist with a full palette of paints. So step up and choose your brush!" #npc$$825$1#|
5188|#&7$Linda##br#
"You know that famous saying: 'A dead warrior deals ZERO damage.' Make sure to stay alive and be an asset to your team with a good set of armor - like the kind I conveniently have for sale!" #npc$$825$1#|
5189|#&7$Marth##br#
"Cheap weapons, expensive weapons...folks make a big distinction between 'em, but I sell all types. Way I see it, even a cheap weapon works if it lasts long enough to secure a victory."#npcs85h+70$$825$1#|
5190|#&7$Asala##br#
"Gird yourself with the finest steel! Unless you're one of those magic-users; then gird yourself with the finest cloth! It may not be as effective 'gainst a brutal hammer blow, but the color will really complement your eyes."#npcs85h+70$$825$1#|
5191|#&7$Johnny##br#
"Hey hey hey! You're looking for weapons, I presume, and I just so happen to be a purveyor of fine weaponry. What a coincidence! I can tell we're gonna hit it off, you and me!" #npc$$825$1#|
5192|#&7$Joey##br#
"You know what's cool? Me. Know what's not cool? Walking around naked. It's embarrassing, and monsters can get at your soft, vulnerable parts. So be cool like me and pick up some armor, ya dig?" #npc$$825$1#|
5193|#&7$Marcie##br#
"Heeeeey, you look like a customer! That's my favorite kind of new person to meet. I know you'll love the weapons I've got for sale. Do you favor boom-boom, smashy-smashy, or whoosh-bang?" #npc$$825$1#|
5194|#&7$Adams##br#

"Salutations to you, %n%! I'm a Fame Quests clerk. Our firm manages business requests, matching every need with someone who can fill that need."#npc$$822$1# 

#&7$Mirabelle##br# 
"First, we take requests submitted by clients. Requests can and do come from anyone and anywhere - we field requests from individuals and organizations all over the world. Their requests usually call for people with certain abilities - people like yourself. If you complete a job, we'll dispense the agreed-upon reward for that job."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Mirabelle##br# 
"If you're confident in your skills, check the bulletin board for missions you can accept. On behalf of all our clients, thanks in advance for your help!"#npc$$822$1#|
5204|#&7$Isaias##br#
"I've got a feeling the hidden treasure is somewhere close... People call me the Explorer King, so I kind of have a reputation to live up to. I have to find it." #npc$$824$1#|
5205|#&7$Isaias##br#
"Thanks for lending a hand. Given enough time, I can take them out myself, but it's better to beat down those beetles quickly and keep up a good pace." #br##br#
#&53$Isaias gives you a once-over as he speaks, evaluating your fitness.# #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Isaias##br#
"I think it was written in the job posting, but let me introduce myself again. I'm Isaias, sometimes known as the Explorer King, and the client you're working for on this adventurous quest!" #npc$$822$1# 

#&7$Isaias##br#
"When I set my sights on something, I don't stop until I have it. Sometimes, that means courting danger, but my experience as a seasoned adventurer always helps me work through it." #npc$$824$1# 

#&7$Isaias##br#
"On my way to investigate a rumor of treasure, I was waylaid by these beetles, and they haven't stopped coming. Experience told me this was a job for two, so I put up that listing, I was hoping someone like you would see it. Besides, it's fun to share the excitement of discovery with others!" #npc$$827$1# 

#&7$Isaias##br#
"It looks like you hit the jackpot - the promise of treasure, AND the chance to travel with someone cool, like me. Who knows what kind of riches we'll find deep in the pit?" #npc$$824$1# 

#&7$Isaias##br#
"Problem is, those beetles grabbed my only map. Take a little time to catch your breath, then it's time to take back that treasure map and find where X marks the spot!" #npc$$821$1#|
5206|Let's go find some treasure!|
5207|#&7$Isaias##br#
"Hey, you're not hurt, are you?"#br##br#
#&53$Isaias gives you a quick check to make sure no body parts have gone missing.# #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Isaias##br#
"Look at those mounds! Beetle mounds, I mean. You know, they have a habit of burying things in those mounds. Why don't we dig a few up and see what we can find?" #br##br#
#&53$Isaias energetically grabs a shovel and digs into a mound.# #npc$$821$1#|
5208|I found something! Let's keep going and see if we can uncover more!|
5209|#&7$Isaias##br#
"Hmm...nothing in this mound either. Maybe we should try some of the other mounds again. I just have this feeling the treasure's gotta be here." #npc$$821$1#

*Try digging up the nearby mounds, and check to see if your inventory has empty spaces to receive dropped items.|
5210|#&7$Gavin##br#
"Not much mail gets sent out here, truth be told. In spite of that, I still take pride in a job well done. Nothing like seeing the smile on someone's face when I hand them a long-awaited letter." #npc$$821$1#|
5211|I'm looking for the owner of this letter.|
5212|#&7$Gavin##br#
"Looks like you've got a pretty old letter here. I'd wager the recipient is probably getting on in years, too. You ought to find old Loma; he's something of an unofficial village historian, and might know something." #npc$$821$1#|
5213|#&7$Posey##br# 
"It's hard to track down the Purple Lotus, just like all the stories say. Been searchin' the forest for ages now, and I haven't seen a one." #npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
5214|#&7$Loma##br#
"Ah, we've got some nice weather today, don't you think? I feel like I could bask in the sun like a lizard." #npc$$821$1#|
5215|#&7$Loma##br#
"Helonia's most striking beauties, eh? I remember a real class-A knockout a long time ago, but no one's sure where she is now. Last I'd heard, though, she still wasn't married." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Loma##br#
"If you want to know more, you should ask Auntie May. She hears so much through the grapevine, she ought to start her own vineyard, heh heh!" #npc$$821$1#|
5216|#&7$Simone##br#
"I've heard that a highly skilled hunter can down two marks with a single shot. I don't know how long it'll take me to reach that level, but I hope I do someday." #npc$$821$1#|
5217|#&7$Auntie May##br#
"If you hear any juicy tidbits, don't forget to tell me! I'll return the favor, of course." #npc$$821$1#|
5218|#&7$Auntie May##br#
"The most beautiful girl this village has ever seen, eh? Maybe if I was 10 years younger, I could be the one! This letter looks mighty old, though."#br##br#
#&53$Auntie May lowers her head, sifting through a trove of old memories.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Auntie May##br#
"Oh-ho-ho! It's her! She has to be the one!" Auntie May leaps up, gesturing excitedly toward the southwest.#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Auntie May##br#
"If you head down that way, you'll find the house of a lady who lives alone. I don't really know her personally - she doesn't interact much with anyone - but I've heard men older than me sigh over her as the belle of the village."#npc$$821$1#|
5219|#&7$Hugh##br# 
"Let's patrol near the center of the circus as soon as possible, then sweep out into the far corners. Most cases occur in places like those." #npc$$821$1#|
5220|#&7$Solitary Woman##br#
"......." #npc$$821$1#|
5221|Is this letter yours?|
5222|#&7$Solitary Woman##br#
#&53$The woman's eyes seem to light up when she sees the letter.# #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Solitary Woman##br#
"This...it's definitely his handwriting. Finally some news of him, after so long..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Solitary Woman##br#
#&53$The woman takes the envelope and hurriedly opens it.# #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Solitary Woman##br#
"It seems his ship met with an accident when he was on a long journey many years ago, so he wasn't able to return as he'd promised. Thank you so much for delivering this letter. Knowing his love for me hasn't changed means the world to me." #npc$$821$1#|
5223|#&7$Solitary Woman##br#
#&53$Seeing the woman's distant eyes, you understand how the townspeople have had difficulty getting to know her. You want to know more about who sent that letter, but...perhaps it's better not to ask right now.# #npc$$1$1#|
5224|Battle insects with Donny.|
5225|#&7$Donny##br#
"Heh. Not a bad lookin' beetle you've got there! I doubt you can beat my Black Cyclone, though. He was last year's champ." #npc$$821$1#|
5226|#&7$Donny##br#
"If you wanna challenge me, you have to bring a beetle. As last year's Helonian Insect Champion, I'll  take on any comers!" #npc$$821$1#|
5227|#&7$Auntie May##br#
"The recipient of this letter? You ought to ask the postman, Gavin."#npc$$821$1#|
5228|#&7$Loma##br#
"Who's this letter meant for? Hmm... I think your best bet is to find Gavin and ask him." #npc$$821$1#
|
5229|#&7$Blair##br#
"Recently, refugees have come flooding into the fortress. Sure as I'm alive, there's a threat out there beyond the Great Wall, and we can't afford to ignore it. If we want to protect our people from harm, we're going to need to bolster this fortress's defenses." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Blair##br#
"You seem like you still have some energy in you. See those fence repair tools over there? I'd like you to take them beneath the fortress and click on the damaged fence to fix it. Shouldn't be too hard, but make sure to avoid the roving monsters as best you can." #npc$$822$1#|
5230|Give the flailing octopus to Isaac.|
5231|#&7$Isaac##br#
"Thanks a bunch! I was worried I might not have enough fish to sell, since we spend so much of our fishing time fending off pirates. I really want to go back to the coast and fish there." #npc$$821$1#|
5232|#&7$Drew##br#
"I took as much with me as I could when I fled the village, but I must have dropped my most important package somewhere along the way. I can't find it anywhere, and the worry is keeping me awake at night." #npc$$828$1#|
5233|#&7$Sneaky Villager##br#
#&53$The villager glances quickly from side to side, looking somewhat uneasy.# #npc$$821$1#|
5234|Say hello to the Sneaky Villager.|
5235|#&7$Sneaky Villager##br#
"You must've been sent here by the vice-captain. I prepared a report on Helonia's recent situation - here, take this letter back to the pirates camp. And hurry!" #npc$$821$1#|
5236|#&7$Sneaky Villager##br#
#&53$The Sneaky Villager doesn't seem to notice you.# #npc$$821$1#|
5237|#&7$Undercover Pirate##br#
"Ssssssh. I'm actually from the village, but I'm deep undercover with the Catseye Pirates. I suspect they've got an undercover spy in the village, but until now, though, I haven't found the kind of evidence I've been looking for." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Undercover Pirate##br#
"There's another pirate outfit in the box over there. Maybe you can put it on and go to the village. If the pirates have a spy there, they might seek you out, and you can use that chance to ply them for info." #npc$$821$1#|
5238|Give him the intel on the village.|
5239|#&7$Undercover Pirate##br#
"Sure enough, someone in the village is in cahoots with the pirates. No wonder they're so well-informed of our goings-on. I'll have to reveal this to the village as soon as I can." #npc$$821$1#|
5240|Give the package to Drew.|
5241|Give the crab meat to Bella.|
5242|#&7$Bella##br#
"You know Perry, that alchemist outside the orchard, right? He's always clamoring for fresh crab, but lately, the coast has become a dangerous place to forage. And just when I'm wondering how I'll get my hands on some crab meat, there you are!"#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Bella##br#
"Just you wait there a second. I'll cook it up in a jiffy, then you can take some to Perry."#br##br#
#&53$Bella strides into the kitchen and starts preparing the fresh crab.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Bella##br#
#&53$You hear the clank and clatter of pots and pans, and the snap of grilling meat. Soon, Bella emerges with a still-steaming plate.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"This here's one of my finest dishes - crab meatballs! Once Perry gets a taste, he's sure to cry tears of joy!"#npc$$821$1#|
5243|#&7$Bella##br#
"I've developed a sure-to-be-famous recipe, but the problem is, the ingredients are hard to come by. If you really want some, though, bring me Crab Meat, Parrot Thighs, and Spices. Then I can whip up a batch in no time!" #npc$$821$1#|
5244|Give the Crab Meatballs to Perry.|
5245|#&7$Perry##br#
"Bella promised to fix me the crab dish to end all crab dishes one day. Is...is that it? Yes, give it to meeeee!"#br##br#
#&53$Perry's expression seems to be one of pure bliss as he pours the entire dish of crab meatballs into his mouth.##npc$$821$1#|
5246|#&7$Drew##br#
"You managed to track down my lost package? Truly amazing! You have my thanks - now I can rest easy." #npc$$822$1#|
5247|#&7$Solitary Witch##br#
"Argh... I'm so pissed! The pirates put a curse on me that prevents me from leaving the Silverash Shores. The only thing that can break the curse is the pirates' silver coins." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Solitary Witch##br#
"Of course, I can't go find the silver coins myself because the curse keeps me stranded here - you see the kind of pickle I'm in. Of course, there's nothing stopping YOU from busting in there and snatching those coins for me..." #npc$$821$1#|
5248|Hand the silver coins to the Witch.|
5249|#&7$Solitary Witch##br#
"Excellent! Finally, these lovely coins are here with me where they ought to be. Let me thank you for a job well done." #npc$$821$1#|
5250|#&7$Solitary Witch##br#
"The pirates to the north pilfered my stash of silver coins. There are seven in all, and they're very important to me. I'd like you to help me take them back." #npc$$821$1#|
5251|#&7$Carmichael##br#
"It's my duty to make sure the windmill is always running smoothly, but it's not as easy as you might think. I have to make little adjustments based on the wind's power and direction to optimize performance." #npc$$821$1#|
5252|Help gather wind power data.|
5253|#&7$Carmichael##br#
"The whole village gets its power from that windmill. If it was broken, it'd have serious repercussions in the villagers' lives. That's why I take my job seriously." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Carmichael##br#
"If you'd like to help, just take this anemometer to the designated spots and use it to collect data on the wind's speed and direction." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Carmichael##br#
"Just take it around to Helonia's 3 exits and gather data at each place. Once you've done that, just bring it back to me and you're done!" #npc$$821$1#|
5254|#&7$Carmichael##br#
"You've got the anemometer unit. All you have to do is take a reading at each data collection point." #npc$$821$1#|
5255|Give the wind data to Carmichael.|
5256|#&7$Carmichael##br#
"Wow, you finished up faster than I was expecting. Let me just look over this data first. Hmm...everything seems to be in order." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Carmichael##br#
"A big thanks to you. Now I can start making the necessary adjustments to the windmill right away." #npc$$822$1#|
5257|#&7$Heinrich##br#
"My team and I came here to conduct an investigation. I just received the order to pull back, but with all those malfunctioning robots running around, a safe evacuation won't be easy." #npc$$821$1#|
5258|#&7$Ralph##br#
"I'm gonna be a Pirate King one day! I mean...once I gather a seaworthy crew for my adventures." #npc$$821$1#|
5259|Hand the conch shell to Ralph.|
5260|#&7$Ralph##br#
"Oooooh, thanks! Now I can summon my future crewmates and minions." #npc$$821$1#|
5261|Help Heinrich's team fall back to safety.|
5262|Give the parrot to Perry.|
5263|#&7$Perry##br#
"This is really a beautiful parrot. Where did you find it? With this brave bird at my side, I'll always have someone to talk to!" #npc$$821$1#|
5264|#&7$Mulrooney##br#
"Lately, the village's energy reserves have been in the red. There isn't even enough juice to power my robot." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5265|Give the makeup ingredients to Sue.|
5266|#&7$Sue##br#
"Oh-hoho, how excellent of you! I can't wait to see how I look all dolled up with this hawt, hawt makeup." #npc$$821$1#|
5267|#&7$Sue##br#
"Yes, yes! This green juice is just the pigment I need! Do you think you could share an eensy-weensy bit with me?" #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Sue##br#
"In order to prepare for my brilliant debut in the big city, I have to know how to really doll myself up. I found a book about makeup while walking in the forest not long ago, so I took it as a sign from the spirits that it's time to start a beauty regimen!" #npc$$825$1# 

#&7$Sue##br#
"The book says I need Birdbrain feathers and Green Juice. You've got the juice already, so do you think you could help me out with the feathers?" #npc$$822$1# 

#&7$Sue##br#
"The Birdbrains north of the village look stupid - and they are, really - but they do get angry when you try to yank out their plumage. I'd been worrying about how to get my hands some some of those feathers, so do you think you can get a few for me?" #npc$$821$1#|
5268|Give the mechanical parts to Paolo.|
5269|#&7$Paolo##br#
"These look like robot parts. Where did you get them, anyway? I might be able to use them to put together a new robot."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5270|#&7$Paolo##br#
"Not to brag or anything, but I'm pretty awesome at repairing machines. If you have any mechanical parts you don't want, just bring 'em to me and I'll have a look at them."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5271|Present the Birdbrain to Clark.|
5272|#&7$Clark##br#
"I might be able to make more money if I delve into breeding and selling livestock. Look at that bird - it seems healthy, and I'm sure we can fatten it up." #npc$$821$1#|
5273|#&7$Clark##br#
"I mostly grow crops on my farm, but lately, I've been wanting to expand - maybe get myself some livestock. Now that I think of it, the Birdbrains around Lunarin can be domesticated and bred. You think you could bring one back for me?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"There's a lot of feed next to the building behind me. I don't know whether Birdbrains will eat it, but let's try. If they eat it, you can always come back and get more." #npc$$821$1#|
5274|#&7$McCain##br#
"Since you've come out to Lunarin, you ought to try our village's Nectar Wine. We make it ourselves; it's a unique, sweet taste you can't get anywhere else." #M005010$McCain$821$1#

#&7$McCain##br#
"Actually, I just sold my last bottle. But if you can bring me back some Intoxicating Nectar from the Flower Field, I'll be able to distill a fresh batch. What do you say?" #M005010$McCain$828$1#|
5275|Give the intoxicating nectar to McCain.|
5276|#&7$McCain##br#
"The wildlife around the Flower Field has been on the aggressive side lately, so that nectar has started becoming the deciding factor in how much wine I can make. As thanks, let me give you the first bottle from this new batch!" #br##br#
#&53$McCain heads to his wine cellar to prepare the ingredients for his Nectar Wine.# #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$McCain##br#
"Ah, done at last! Here, the very first bottle, just as I promised. Drink it and appreciate the beauty life has to offer." #npc$$821$1#|
5277|#&7$McCain##br#
"The whole village has been busy preparing for the ceremony, and in all the hubbub, I've run out of nectar to make my famous #br# Nectar Wine! You think you could help me out? If you bring me some Intoxicating Nectar, I'll conjure up the best thing you've ever sipped from a bottle." #npc$$821$1#|
5278|Give the lion's mane to Anthony.|
5279|#&7$Anthony##br#
"Wow, is that really a Lion's Mane? It's so...manly. I feel gruff and stoic just holding it. Now, how was I supposed to use this to cure my balding?" #npc$$821$1#|
5280|Assist Mulrooney by obtaining some energy.|
5281|#&7$Gruff##br#
"W-where's my precious treasure?" #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5282|Let me help you find it!|
5283|#&7$Gruff##br#
"Oh, thank you. But you know, I don't quite remember where I dropped it. How about I tag along with you? That way, if I remember anything, you'll be the first to know." #npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
5284|Give the slate fragments to Rosie.|
5285|#&7$Rosie##br#
"Oooooh. Hmm... These fragments have seen a lot of weathering, but I should be able to piece them back together. Let's see here..." #br##br#
#&53$Rosie immediately focuses on the fragments, seemingly lost to the outside world or even your casual pokes.# #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Yessss! It is complete! The text on this tablet is older than I know how to translate, but it seems to show the Alabastren Temple Ruins. So exciting! You should go there and see what you can find." #npc$$824$1#|
5286|#&7$Rosie##br#
"I feel like I don't have enough research to do these days. If you can bring me 5 Slate Fragments, I'll bet I can restore them into a complete tablet. That buzz would keep me going for a month!" #npc$$821$1#|
5287|Give the flower to Nala.|
5288|#&7$Nala##br#
"Wow, thank you so much! Now I'll be able to finish my preparations before the ceremony begins. I know it's not much, but let me give you this wreath. I made it myself!" #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Nala lifts up a hand-made wreath and places it on your head.# #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Nala##br#
"Hehee... It suits you. Now you look at least 20% cooler." #br# #&53$Nala surveys her handiwork, looking quite pleased.# #npc$$825$1#|
5289|#&7$Nala##br#
"I still need a lot of flowers if I'm going to finish these ceremony decorations on time. If you're headed out around the Flower Field, do you think you could bring back 10 Perfect Flowers for me?" #npc$$821$1#|
5290|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"The king is overcome with worry that something has happened to the princess. I wish she'd stay closer to home, but she won't listen to us - she has an adventurous streak a mile wide and wants to make her name as a warrior. I think her mental fortitude outpaces her physical strength, though." #npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
5291|#&7$Zinnia##br#
"Hmph. I'll have you know, I'm a mighty warrior of the Grasslands! I won't take on just anyone as my attendant. Go on, run along now."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
5292|#&7$Cole##br#
"Grrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" #npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
5293|#&7$Rehia##br#
"Begone from my sight, inferior creatures." #npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
5294|#&7$Moe##br#
"Oh, are you inviting me to share in the consumption of some delectable insects? You should know I love worms the most."#npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
5295|Hey, you can't go this way!|
5296|Did you hear me? I said you can't go this way! Get outta here!|
5297|I'll be... No! I've been discovered!|
5298|Hmmm... This option's not bad. That one has its merits too...|
5299|Gonna go with this one. Time to strike!|
5300|Eh?! Did it just move?|
5301|No!|
5302|It seems like the monsters have been cleared out. Everyone okay here?|
5303|After we catch a breather, let's pack up and continue on to the next battle!|
5304|No way!|
5305|#&7$Max##br#
"Oh? Why are you still here?"#br##br#
#&53$Max looks toward you with a hint of impatience.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Max##br#
"We're organizing a cleanup effort to mop up the mess that the Oreling made. After that, we're going to draw up some new projects sites for the mine. If there's nothing else, you'd best clear out." #br##br#
#&53$Max points to the exit. His face tells you that he's unlikely to pay you more.##npc$$827$1#|
5306|#&7$Abel##br#
"Please, find Bartley quickly and help him. He's the strongest of us all, but it's still very dangerous out there, and his combat training isn't really up-to-date."#br##br#
#&53$Abel pleads with you to waste no time in your search.##npc$$829$1#|
5307|#&7$Abel##br#
"The miners' wages and treatment aren't bad - the problem is, the workload is a real handful and the mines can be dangerous. Collapses, methane gas, and now a monster..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Abel##br#
"Have you ever considered a career in the exciting world of mining? I think this project will be more successful with you around. You know, we could totally use some good hired muscle..." #npc$$823$1#|
5308|#&7$Bartley##br#
"I've got years of experience in mining, but that doesn't do much for my ability to fend off a monster - even if it IS a monster made of stone!" #npc$$823$1#|
5309|#&7$Bartley##br#
"Looks like everyone's fine. That's a relief." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bartley##br#
"If I was the boss, I definitely would've given you a bigger reward. It's a shame our boss is a little...financially challenged. He's a good man outside of financial matters, though. Otherwise, he wouldn't have sought out your help, right?" #npc$$829$1#|
5310|#&7$Clermont##br#
"Aren't you going to look for the other miners? You'd better hurry! Don't worry about me. I'm safe here - a lot safer than before you showed up, anyway." #npc$$826$1#|
5311|#&7$Clermont##br#
"I heard footsteps, and the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. I shouted and made a bunch of noise to drive away the monster, not realizing that it was actually just the boss." #npc$$827$1#|
5312|#&7$Dustin##br#
"I'm a little tied up at the moment, if you didn't notice. Whatever it is can wait - I need all my focus for this!"#br##br#
#&53$Dustin continues to throw himself into his mining work. Perhaps you should find the other three and check back later.##npc$$827$1#|
5313|#&7$Dustin##br#
"We're in agreement, right? Not a word to the boss about what I just did." #br# #&53$Dustin nods at you knowingly.# #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Dustin##br#
"We'll talk about the mineral identification course next time, okay? It's just kind of inconvenient to chat with you while the boss is here." #npc$$821$1#|
5314|#&7$Maiden Priestess##br#
"As you enter, you will see the Altar of Spirits standing before you. This is sacred ground - only those who participate in the trials, along with their companions, are allowed beyond." #npc$$821$1#|
5315|#&7$Stanley##br#
"I've got a duty to defend my injured team members so they won't be jumped by more monsters. One of them is battling it out with spirits in the Old Tomb - can you help him out?"#npc$$51$1#|
5316|Don't you worry about it. I'll take care of things!|
5317|Sorry, just passing on through. Good luck!|
5318|#&7$Meira##br#
"Oh! Are you here to help me pass the trials? I can't really pay you much, but this is really important to me, and I don't know if I can do it without you." #npc$$829$1#|
5319|#&7$Graceful Sprite##br#
"We fairy-folk are always working to bring people happiness. We do have an evaluation, though - those who pass are the ones we give top priority to." #npc$$2$1#|
5320|I want precise casting and forging.|
5321|Pilot the Augustus Mk.VII to complete the quest. (Lv.37 A Powerful Prize)|
5322|You can't pilot the Augustus Mk.VII right now. #br#
(Must accept Lv.37 Quest "A Powerful Prize" first.)|
5323|It's your turn, break it.|
5324|Yikes! I'll be electrocuted if I hit it wrong?|
5325|Of course you'll go. You're the newbie!|
5326|Stop yakking and get out there! You want the boss to tan all our hides?|
5327|Oooooh-kaaaay... I hope this is the right order.|
5328|Aaaaaah!|
5329|If I mess up, I'll be electrocuted and teleported off to who-knows-where... I'll go pick him up under the big tree.|
5330|Are you saying the order is being repeated?|
5331|Yeah, the sequence was like this last time.|
5332|I said we should've been taking notes!|
5333|There shouldn't be any more problems - we already know several combinations that don't work.|
5334|There are four totems, four sequences, and things like four to the fourth power.|
5335|It's really different from what I read.|
5336|Pretty good, wasn't I?|
5337|That seems wrong... The group order should go 4 times, then 3 times...|
5338|You've been around the block, so to speak. Think you can do better than me?|
5339|Don't question the wisdom of your elders! Go hit the next one.|
5340|I have a report! The electric thorns disappeared, revealing a secret passage beyond.|
5341|Heh! It looks like my dependable team has undone the seal.|
5342|Come on, that little girl must be hiding inside, along with the treasure!|
5343|#&7$Ancient Tree##br#
#&53$You can smell the seasoned age of this great tree's wood. Beneath its gnarled boughs, your worries feel far away.# #npc$$821$1#|
5344|#&7$Mina##br#
"The reason we chose this cave for our secret stronghold is because of the magical tree. The more one stays here, the more physically and mentally refreshed they feel. It's actually increased my speed and strength considerably."#npc$$821$1#|
5345|#&7$Hayes##br#
"The plan can't fail. We don't have the resources left for another go at it. If anything goes awry, our years of efforts will all be in vain." #npc$$1$1#|
5346|#&7$Ben##br#
"If the Sanknie Union hadn't reduced the number of guards, those bandits would never have dared to lay a hand on us."#br##br#
#&53$Ben looks pretty steamed up.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Thing is, if the plan doesn't show signs of progress, well... Our research funding from headquarters isn't exactly limitless..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"I understand Hayes' feelings, and why HQ is doing this, but it's hard for the escort guards to get a word in edgewise, caught up directly in this as we are."#npc$$1$1#|
5347|#&7$Camilla##br#
"I'm not sure how much capital has been used up over the years. The Bungemarke Bandits took advantage of our lack of manpower, and their raids have become more frequent lately." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"They coat their weapons with a poison that robs a person of all their strength, even from wounds as small as a needle's scratch. It might not kill us, but it leaves us defenseless." #npc$$1$1#|
5348|#&7$Second Expedition Member##br#
"I... I'm afraid..." #npc$$1$1#|
5349|#&7$Second Expedition Member##br#
"Man, I want to go home so badly... Ack! Don't tell the leader what I just said..."#npc$$1$1#|
5350|#&7$Maxim##br#
"I don't know how to make this up to Hayes. I've been leading the second expedition, but we got lost among the dunes and now we've fallen prey to the bandits."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Maxim##br#
"He gave me a pat me on the shoulder, but it made me feel even more guilty. Maybe I'm not cut out to lead..."#npc$$1$1#
|
5351|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"If you move out into the sand plains, you can avoid the bandit patrols. At least, that's what I was told."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Unfortunately, we did run into a patrol. We survived the scuffle, but Jonah got hurt."#npc$$1$1#|
5352|#&7$Jonah##br#
#&53$Jonah lies on the ground, shivering as he flits in and out of consciousness. He looks very weak.##npc$$1$1#|
5353|#&7$Clive##br#
"I've never imagined we'd get beaten like that. When we've crossed swords with the Bungemarke in the past, they didn't seem anywhere near that powerful."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Clive##br#
"Maybe this is 'cause of their new leader. Have you seen him? He has this mysterious, eerie feel about him."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Clive##br#
"I also heard there's a cute girl that follows him around. I didn't see her when we were captured, though, so who knows whether it's true or not."#npc$$1$1#|
5354|#&7$Freddie##br#
"That map is super important. If you can't get it back, that'll be the end of the road for the Star Program."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Freddie##br#
"Just look at Hayes' face. He looks so serious right now! I bet he could stare down a gorgon right now."#npc$$1$1#|
5355|#&7$Helakar##br#
#&53$Helakar, leader of the Bungemarke bandits, stands still and silent, his presence hanging like a mirage upon the sands.##npc$$1$1#|
5356|#&7$Akara##br#
"Some say these dunes are cursed by a mysterious power, and that any navigation devices used around here will break."#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$Akara##br#
"However, I have learned to peacefully coexist with these ever-shifting sands."#npc$$1$1#|
5357|#&7$Tina##br#
"The second expedition team has been really unlucky. They got lost in the sand dunes, and, even though Akara found them, they were forced to leave all their instruments behind in the desert."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tina##br#
"Now they've been hit by a Bungemarke ambush! The losses are really starting to add up."#npc$$1$1#|
5358|#&7$Merle##br#
"Why is it that, no matter how many people the union sends, no matter how much money they throw at him, Akara isn't swayed?"#npc$$1$1#|
5359|#&7$Haas##br#
"I know all about the plants around here, so I came to help. Helping people feels good, and it feels even better when the grown-ups give me money for it! I know mom and dad will be happy."#npc$$1$1#|
5360|#&7$Cart##br#
#&53$It is a pushcart that can be used to transport things.#|
5361|#&7$Cart##br#
#&53$It is a pushcart that can be used to transport things.#|
5362|#&7$Omar##br#
"It's hard for me to believe the curse of the Ozymand Temple really exists. If we can get through here, we'll be able to discover how much truth is behind the temple rumors."#npc$$1$1#|
5363|#&7$Sherman##br#
"I've been a member of many archaeological expeditions in my time, but none have been as thrilling as this one."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"No one has ever seen these creatures before. They look rather like the serpent-men of Balunthia, but their behaviors, social mannerisms, and physical characteristics demonstrate some curious differences."#npc$$1$1#|
5364|#&7$Omar##br#
"You must stop that girl! If she absorbs the energy of the Sand Gem, not only will she die, the temple's curse will fall on all of us!"#npc$$821$1#|
5365|#&7$Akara##br#
"We have come to help you, %n%! Let us join together and topple the Cactoids!"#npcs85h+70$$1$1#|
5366|#&7$Omar##br#
"Ah, %n%, I'm still reveling in the wonder of it all. After so many years of exploration, our work is finally complete."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I can just see Hayes now, trying to hide his tears of joy."#npc$$1$1#|
5367|#&7$Yolanda##br#
"Your adventurous spirit reminds me of my husband, Lucas. He's an ecological researcher, so he spends a lot of time away from home, working in other countries."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Yolanda##br#
"I'm starting to get a little twinge of uneasiness, though. It feels like he's been gone too long, and I've been waiting for him to write home..."#npc$$1$1#|
5368|#&7$Carrick##br#
"As you've probably seen for yourself, I've got a buttload of problems to deal with."#npc$$1$1#|
5369|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"The commander knows that, without a doubt, there are some harsh battles in our future. That's why I'm trying my best to get all our supplies in order before we have to send any troops out."#npc$$1$1#|
5370|#&7$Frightened Victim##br#
"I-I don't remember that night really well. It's all broken up and confusing. I heard people screaming, and right after that, the Varan appeared..."#npc$$1$1#|
5371|#&7$Cold Victim##br#
"The Oblitus Wood was named by the ancient people of this region. Back then, the forests around here stretched out like a rolling sea of trees, said to ease the worries of those beneath their canopy and lift them to a euphoric state."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Cold Victim##br#
"Who in those days long past would imagine that the Oblitus Wood would turn into this?"#npc$$1$1#|
5372|#&7$Leonard##br#
"Lady Analisa dislikes the guards following her everywhere, but for someone of her rank, it'd be grossly irresponsible for her NOT to have a guard detail." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"It'd be great if you didn't get into any danger, otherwise it's curtains for Zachary and me. Next time, we'll be keeping a close eye on her, no matter how much she protests." #npc$$1$1#|
5373|#&7$Zachary##br#
"Hey! Don't let me catch you running around here!"#br##br#
#&53$Zachary's attentions are focused on shouting orders at a few nearby children.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"I don't dare disobey Lady Analisa's request, but even years of combat training have done little to teach me to handle kids."#npc$$829$1#|
5374|#&7$Jill##br#
"This forest looks a little creepy, but I've followed Mommy to so many weird places that this one's not that scary."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Jill##br#
"I dunno about other people, but all us kids from Krok know the places outside the village pretty well."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Jill##br#
"It looks like Mister Zachary is all nervous. Maybe you should calm him down."#npc$$1$1#|
5375|#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"I never thought our next meeting would be like this. How long has passed since we last parted, %n%? You seem to have grown a lot."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"As for me, I have kept the promise I made back then, training myself intently."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#|
5376|#&7$Analisa##br#
"Jill is alright, right? I wanted Zachary to retreat with her and the other children. Odum and I are relatively safe here. The children weren't."#npc$$821$1#|
5377|#&7$Shay##br#
"We've already done our best to minimize the damage."#M054010s85h+30$Shay$821$1#|
5378|#&7$Walker##br#
"Tried asking the Church for support - only thing they sent was this machine. It's recharging right now, but who knows how long that'll take. I'd rather they sent a few more able-bodied people like you."#npc$$1$1#|
5379|#&7$Turret##br#
#&53$The machine is on and emits a quiet hum. A panel on the side shows that it is recharging. It seems like that turret won't be too much of a threat until it's fully charged.##npc$$1$1#|
5380|#&7$Vincent##br#
"Whoa there! Be careful, you're walking right near poisonous thorns. You get pricked, you'll start itching, then aching, then go completely numb! It's no joke!"#M121011h+55$Vincent$501$1#|
5381|#&7$Dolan##br#
"That young'un Tobin took his father's place as village chief, but I'm worried he might've taken on too much responsibility too quickly."#M052011s85h+70$Dolan$1$1#

#&7$Dolan##br#
"The reason Tafay Village has fallen like this is because of the state of the Oblitus Wood. No one really believes it's due to a lack of leadership."#M052011$Dolan$1$1#|
5382|#&7$Farmer##br#
"Seeing the robots who used to plough the fields make such a mess of our farmland is like a knife to the gut."#M050011s85h+70$Farmer$1$1#|
5383|#&7$Mechanic##br#
"Some robots went on the fritz and started gathering to the south, at Crackstone Well, one after another. The village chief reckons there's something down at the bottom of the well, and I'm as curious as anyone to know what."#M050041s85h+70$Mechanic$1$1#

#&7$Mechanic##br#
"Could it be a long-lost energy source? I've been living in Tafay ever since I was a wee one, but I've never heard any mention of some anomalous energy or what-have-you."#M050041$Mechanic$1$1#|
5384|#&7$Jorali##br#
"I didn't expect the Ghostweep Ruins to be so terrifying... Never seen those kinds of monsters before... Fighting with monsters over energy... how'd it come to this?"#M050011s85h+70$Jorali$1$1#

#&7$Jorali##br#
"I managed to get out alive, but I'm scared for everyone who's still stuck back at Ghostweep Ruins."#M050011$Jorali$1$1#|
5385|#&7$Alvin##br#
"Everyone knows the chief wants the best for Tafay. That's why I came here, along with everyone else."#M050051s85h+70$Alvin$1$1#

#&7$Alvin##br#
"Tobin just takes on too much. He's afraid of letting those who depend on him down. But even the strongest shoulders can only carry so much weight."#M050051$Alvin$1$1#|
5386|#&7$Shaine##br#
"Gads... if I can escape these beasties and wake up safe and sound in Tafay, I swear, this time I'll really propose to Shana. This time, for sure!"#M050011s85h+70$Shaine$1$1#|
5387|#&7$Energy Collection Device##br#|
5388|#&7$Tobin##br#
"Agh, it's all my fault. I nearly led all my hometown mates to their doom!"#M051021s85h+70$Tobin$1$1#|
5389|#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"Fight...under the Church's banner? Well, I admit, that's not what I expected to hear."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#|
5390|#&7$Halton##br#
#&53$Potter stands near the entrance to the Mistwalker Tribe's land, waiting for news that Halton has recovered the Stolen Ceremonial Tome and Ceremonial Vessel.##M003040$Halton$1$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"How's it going? Is the situation under control? Be sure to keep yourself safe out there. I'd hate to be the one to tell your granddad you got hurt."#npc$$1$1#|
5391|#&7$Halton##br#
"This electroreceptor seems quite old, but it should still work."#M003040$Halton$821$0#

#&7$Broken Electroreceptor##br#
#&53$This electroreceptor might help get a read on the location of the Ceremonial Vessel. The waves of energy it emits cloak it from scanners, allowing it to pass the robotic patrols unnoticed.##npc$$1$1#|
5392|#&7$Halton##br#
"Hmm... The electroreceptor's performance seems a bit erratic."#M003040$Halton$823$0#

#&7$Broken Electroreceptor##br#
#&53$The electroreceptor's shielding waves are showing signs of instability. Continuous operation may have substantially drained its battery.##npc$$1$1#|
5393|#&7$Halton##br#
"Has it stopped running? I guess it's really out of juice."#M003040$Halton$821$0#

#&7$Stationary Electroreceptor##br#
#&53$This electroreceptor has exhausted the last of its energy reserves. It sits motionless on the ground, little wisps of smoke curling off its surface.##npc$$1$1#|

"Dad, where are you? Mom's already gone; you're all I have left..."#npc$$829$1#|
5397|#&7$Ida##br#
"My boyfriend Caine always puts in a hard day's work up at the Logging Site. I'm worried about him, though, since the forest has been getting more dangerous."#npc$$821$1#|
5398|Help Ida by delivering the lunchbox to Caine.|
5399|#&7$Ida##br#
"Sometimes, Caine just stays up at the Logging Site without even coming home. How can he get a decent meal out there? Well, with this lunchbox I've made, today sure won't be a day he goes hungry."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ida##br#
"There have been a lot of monsters roaming the forest, so I can't deliver it myself... If you're going by the Logging Site, could you give this lunchbox to Caine for me?"#npc$$821$1#|
5400|#&7$Ida##br#
"Caine's out working at the Logging Site west of the village. Could I trouble you to take this lunchbox to him?" #npc$$821$1#|
5401|Take Caine's letter to Ida.|
5402|#&7$Ida##br#
"Oh, a letter from Caine? Well, let's see how he's doing."#npc$$821$1#|
5403|#&7$Mulrooney##br#
"Around here, the best place to get energy would probably be to the north, where the Ballistic Butterfly Hoplites are. Not that it's an easy task to extract energy from them, mind you."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Mulrooney##br#
#&53$Mulrooney hands you a device.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mulrooney##br#
"I've modified this device so it's able to extract energy directly from robots. Take it with you when you head north and use it to siphon off some energy from the Ballistic Butterfly Hoplites. It shouldn't take too long to fill it up."#npc$$821$1#|
5404|Give Ida's lunchbox to Caine.|
5405|#&7$Caine##br#
"Oh-ho, did Ida pack this lunchbox? Hope you didn't run into too much trouble bringing it up here, but I definitely appreciate it."#br##br#
#&53$Caine gladly accepts the food.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"By the by, I've got a letter here for Ida that I've been meaning to send, but no couriers have been by lately. Could I ask you to deliver this to her if plan on going back to the village?"#npc$$821$1#|
5406|#&7$Mulrooney##br#
"The Ballistic Butterfly Hoplites are really tearing up the farmland to the north. Take this machine and gather energy from them - and hurry!" #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5407|Give Cal the medical supplies.|
5408|#&7$Cal##br#
"Thank ya kindly. I'd been fretting about when we'd get more medicine. Logging is dangerous work, and we've got no shortage of injuries. With medicine, we can treat 'em straightaway, but without it, we'd be up a creek."#npc$$821$1#|
5409|Give the full tank of energy to Mulrooney.|
5410|Give the giant mushrooms to Elena.|
5411|#&7$Elena##br#
"I'm just missing one last ingredient for this batch of magic potions. If you can find me some mushrooms, I'll cast a super-great enchantment of blessing on you!"#npc$$821$1#|
5412|#&7$Elena##br#
"If only I had some Giant Mushrooms, Aquatic Plants, and Bug Eggs, I could cast an incredible spell and make you feel truly blessed!"#npc$$821$1#|
5413|Give the wood to Warren.|
5414|#&7$Warren##br#
"In order to help ships find their bearings at night, this lighthouse must always be lit. Usually the folks at the Logging Site send up plenty of firewood, but I haven't gotten a delivery from them for the last few days."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Warren##br#
"You've been a huge help, let me tell you. It's a load off my mind not having to worry about the lighthouse's flame going out."#npc$$821$1#|
5415|#&7$Lamarr##br#
"Gyooooooooowchowchowch!"#br##br#
#&53$The Dwarf before you hollers out in pain.##npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Lamarr##br#
"Where did all these humans come from? Right from the start it's been nothin' but sappy sweet, lovey-dovey romance, and I've done run outta paper bags to toss up in. I can't take it anymore. Should'a bought me a set of blinders and earplugs."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Lamarr##br#
"My my, you look like the kind-hearted sort - or at least good at fakin' it, gyahaha! If you're headed to the Ghostsweep Ruins, do you think you could find my Working Hat? My head doesn't feel quite the same without it."#npc$$822$1#|
5416|Give Lamarr his Working Hat.|
5417|#&7$Perrin##br#
"These Militia soldiers were attacked by monsters just outside of the Ghostsweep Cave. They weren't just injured - they seem to have been infected by a strange miasma. We need to treat them as soon as possible."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5418|Help Perrin gather medicinal herbs.|
5419|#&7$Millia##br#
"I wish I had a cute pet... That would be sooooo cool."#npc$$821$1#|
5420|Give the Tiny Bunnyhop to Millia.|
5421|#&7$Millia##br#
"This Tiny Bunnyhop is the cutest! I should bring it back and show Mom and Dad. They'll accept one that's this small, right?"#npc$$821$1#|
5422|#&7$Millia##br#
"I always wanted a pet Bunnyhop, so I used cabbages to lure one to my house, but then Mom and Dad said it was too big to keep, so I couldn't have it. It was hard to get it to leave because it wanted more cabbages..."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Millia##br#
"Maybe if it was a Tiny Bunnyhop, Mom and Dad would let me keep it."#npc$$821$1#|
5423|#&7$Westen##br#
"I'd love to capture this beautiful scenery on this page, but I'm missing the most important color for it - blue. If I had some of the sage that grows around here, I could grind the pigment to make a rich blue myself."#npc$$821$1#|
5424|Give the sage to Westen.|
5425|#&7$Westen##br#
"Wow, thank you for bringing me this sage! With blue paint, I'll be able to perfectly recreate this scene."#br##br#
#&53$After Western mixes the pigment, he takes out a pencil and begins to rough out the composition of his piece.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Westen##br#
"Ah, finally finished. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm boasting, but this might be my greatest work. And I want you to have it."#br##br#
#&53$Westen hands you a paper covered in subtle yet powerful blues.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Westen##br#
"I call it 'The Soaring Skies of Skandia'. It really captures the essence of the place, doesn't it? Sometimes, I'm so talented I almost scare myself, heh heh!"#br##br#
#&53$Westen flashes you a satisfied grin.##npc$$821$1#|
5426|#&7$Perrin##br#
"At last, someone capable has shown up! I've been so busy looking after my patients that I've simply had no time for anything! I hardly even noticed how low I am on this particular antidote that it used to treat the condition."#npcs85h+70$$824$1#

#&7$Perrin##br#
"I'll need a medicinal herb that can be found growing within the Forest of Thorns. Its detoxifying properties are just the thing to use for my current patients' ailments. Here, take this shovel and dig up some of those herbs. Be gentle with them, but don't dawdle - time is of the essence!"#npc$$821$1#|
5427|#&7$Brook##br#
"Ah, finally back on ol' terra firma. I could do with a few days of good rest - or even better, a bottle of good wine."#npc$$821$1#|
5428|Give the Wine to Brook.|
5429|#&7$Brook##br#
"Ah, finally! I've waited a long time for this wine. This one's fermented in the bottle and, like the best Skandian wines, it's vintage dated."#br##br#
#&53$Brook uncorks the bottle and takes several deep gulps.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Brook##br#
"Mmmmmaaaaaaah, that's the taste of Skandia. I feel like I've been revived! This is what I look forward to most every time I head toward this port."#npc$$821$1#|
5430|#&7$Perrin##br#
"These herbs grow in the Forest of Thorns, but you'll have to keep an eye to the ground if you want to find them."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5431|Give the Sticky Sap to Brook.|
5432|#&7$Brook##br#
"What I need now is some Sticky Sap to patch up the ships. If you get some for me, I'll make sure you're well-compensated for it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You fulfilled your promise to Brook, giving him the best sap you'd run across in your travels.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Brook##br#
"Ah, that's the kind of sap I like - rich, thick, and creamy. Here, let me give you this. I used to sail all over, trading goods, and another businessman once gave me this curious silver coin in payment."#br##br#
#&53$Brook presses the coin into your palm. Though obviously old, it still retains its shining luster.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Brook##br#
"These silver pieces were minted hundreds of years ago. You can't buy anything with 'em nowadays, but it's still a treasure in the eyes of antiques collectors."#npc$$821$1#|
5433|Give the root herbs to Perrin.|
5434|#&7$Justin##br#
"I'm a merchant specializing in antiques. Do you have anything old collecting dust in your warehouse, inventory, or attic? I can help you discover if you're sitting on a real treasure."#npc$$821$1#|
5435|Give the silver coin to Justin for appraisal.|
5436|#&7$Justin##br#
"Wow. Who'd have thought you'd have something like this on you? This coin is from a kingdom that flourished 300 years ago. Most of them that have survived are in the hands of private collectors."#br##br#
#&53$Justin seems really interested in the Silver Coin.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Justin##br#
"I don't have one of these in my personal collection. Would you perhaps be willing to part with it? I'll give you something good in exchange."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You accept the collector's offer and hand him the silver coin.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Justin##br#
"You've made my day, friend! Here - this crystal is what I'll give you in trade. I bought it from a wandering merchant who told me that it contains a mysterious magical power."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Justin##br#
"It was obviously special, so I dropped a lot of cash on it! Unfortunately, as someone with no training in the magical arts, I couldn't make much practical use of it. Maybe you can."#npc$$821$1#|
5437|#&7$Marissa##br#
"My son is still back in the village! Please, hurry and bring him back to me!"#npc$$828$1#|
5438|Give the crystal to Elena to examine.|
5439|#&7$Elena##br#
"Indeed, there's some kind of strange, magical power sealed inside of this crystal. Let me see if I can unseal it."#npc$$821$1#|
5440|#&7$Dwight##br#
"I came here in search of a source of clean energy, but when I was getting ready to return, I found the area crawling with Varan. I have to stay out of their sight if I want to make it out of here in one piece."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Dwight##br#
"Ah, I just thought of a great plan, but I'll need a cart to do it. Can you canvas the area for a big cart? Doesn't matter how nice it looks, as long as it rolls."#npc$$824$1#|
5441|#&7$Vincent##br#
"Why is the shipment of wine so late? It should have arrived this morning."#npc$$821$1#|
5442|Give the wine barrel to Vincent.|
5443|#&7$Vincent##br#
"Looks like our deliveryman was attacked. I'm glad he wasn't badly hurt, but I'm concerned that so many people are being attacked on the roads these days. I hope we can deal with this issue soon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"Thank you for bringing the barrel back. You're helping to keep me in business. And hey, while I have you here, could I maybe ask a favor of you?"#br##br#
#&53$Vincent hands you a bottle of wine.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"Captain Brook just came into port recently and I know he's been waiting ages for this, but he knows I sell no wine before its time. He's a bit of a boozer, but he won't drink just any swill."#npc$$821$1#|
5444|Bring the broken hand cart to Dwight.|
5445|#&7$Roy##br#
"Can't believe I got jumped out here while I was on a delivery! How am I going to get my cargo to its destination now?"#npc$$821$1#|
5446|Help Roy complete his delivery.|
5447|#&7$Roy##br#
"I was passing right by here, right? Then all of a sudden, WHAM! Got bowled over by some black monster. No permanent damage as far as I can tell, but my cart took a real beating."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Roy##br#
"If you'd like to lend a hand, take this barrel of wine back to Skandia. A wine merchant, Vincent, has a shop near the town's entrance, and I know he'll be glad to set eyes on this shipment."#npc$$821$1#|
5448|#&7$Roy##br#
"Vincent's wine store is near the entrance to Skandia. He's not a hard man to find - just follow your nose. I'll be along eventually, but I need to rest up a bit."#npc$$821$1#|
5449|Give the Sunbird to Flower.|
5450|#&7$Flower##br#
"Ooooh, thankies. This bird looks preeee-tty dumb - the perfect subject for my experiment!"#npc$$821$1#|
5451|#&7$Kuba##br#
"I was dispatched here to look into some strange energy readings we were getting from around here, but there are some brutal-looking monsters around here. I can't go back empty-handed, though. What am I gonna do?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5452|#&7$Billy##br#
"Wow! Someone actually came 'cause of the request I posted! You're just in time. Nobody else knows it, but all the robots around here are plotting something evil. I need you to come with me as I find a robot willing to fight for justice!"#npc$$822$1#|
5453|I, too, am a warrior of justice! Let's roll!|
5454|#&7$Billy##br#
"All right, let's go! If I succeed, dad will have to recognize my competence! Yeaaaaaah! I'm fired up now!"#npc$$824$1#|
5455|#&7$Billy##br#
"Just to be safe, I wanted someone strong to go with me. These caves are no joke, and I wanna come back a winner."#npc$$821$1#|
5456|Intruders... must be eliminated...|
5457|#&7$Stanley##br#
"Excelsior! What I need of you, courageous warrior that you are, is to venture deeper in, removing all the various traps the tomb's architects built. You should find the Ancient Lord's Sword somewhere near the center."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
"This is no simple errand, but you don't strike me as a simple adventurer. I'll join you when I've finished setting up my team's base camp. Be careful, and good luck out there."#npc$$824$1#|
5458|#&7$Stanley##br#
"Wait. You're NOT the brave warrior we've been waiting for? You'll probably want to get out of here ASAP, then. This tomb's rigged with all manner of crazy traps. It's not for the faint of heart."#npc$$823$1#|
5459|#&7$Stanley##br#
"I'm prepping my injured team member for transport to a medical facility, so while you're here, I'd like to ask you again to follow the road and clear out whatever traps or dangers you find. Then, head into the inner tomb and find the Ancient Lord's Sword!"#npc$$822$1#|
5460|(When you touch the machine, it flashes in a burst of light, then disappears!)|
5461|Reach out and touch the glowing orb of light.|
5462|Surely you shall die at my hands!|
5463|How... how could this come to pass?|
5464|No! I refuse to accept this loss! Guuuaaaaaah!|
5465|I'm coming for your head.|
5466|Ghahahahaha!|
5467|I'm going to finish this myself.|
5468|#&7$Blockhead##br#
"..."#npc$$1$1#|
5469|Activate Blockhead with the Boot Rom chip.|
5470|#&7$Blockhead##br#
"To be abandoned... it feels 'sad'. There is still fighting to be done. Thank you... for choosing me. I will perform my utmost."#npc$$2011$1#|
5471|#&7$Blockhead##br#
"..."#br##br#
#&53$(There's no response.)##npc$$1$1#|
5472|Squeak! Squeak!|

5479|Chirp! Chirp! Squeak!|
5480|Enjoy it while it lasts, Reid! The Ham League will be back to wipe that stupid grin off your face!|
5481|Can't we just sit down and talk about this, Shiloh?|
5482|Nothin' to talk about! I'm on my way to round up a posse to help us win!|
5483|I can't just stand here and watch you guys expel Paco!|
5484|So do I have to go out? Remind me!|
5485|Sh... Shiloh...|
5486|#&7$Reid##br#
"Thanks for coming. Now we're in a good place to surprise 'em with a come-from-behind win!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Reid##br#
"Paco will keep sending out scouts to see if there's a chance to turn the tables on 'em. If that doesn't pan out, he might take to the battlefield himself. In the meantime, let's do our best to keep these kids safe."#npc$$828$1#|
5487|Well, how's the situation now?|
5488|#&7$Reid##br#
"Wait a sec, then we'll see. The battle's coming here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reid##br#
"The Lightning Gang includes their leader, Paco, but the Ham League's forces seem endless..."#br##br#
#&53$The strain on Reid's face reflects his worry.##npc$$821$1#|
5489|How can I help?|
5490|#&7$Reid##br#
"Help our Captain. Should the Captain fall, the the squad will be lost.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reid##br#
"If we defeat the opposing Captain, we can push to their stronghold. That'll draw out Hogan, the Ham League's leader. Don't ambush the enemy from behind. Our leader is the only one who can suppress the enemy base."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Reid##br#
"Be careful; there's a lot of them."#npc$$823$1#|
5491|The Lightning Gang is with the Ham League?|
5492|#&7$Reid##br#
"Right! Paco and the others have the same electro-light skin that identify them as the Lightning Gang! They all look the same! As for the Ham League, I'm not sure why Shiloh named them that. Perhaps it is because ham is one of Shiloh's favorite foods..."#npc$$821$1#|
5493|Paco seems to have made a move! Is the battle about to break out!?|
5494|#&7$Reid##br#
"Seems so! He made some secret sounds to guide his unit to set off! Excuse me; I'll stay back here to care for the injured."#npc$$822$1#|
5495|#&7$Shiloh##br#
"You must be the rescue force for Reid."#br##br#
#&53$Shiloh appraises you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shiloh##br#
"That coward Reid thinks he can get help from you, but that's useless. The Ham League is not just big in size, they're also stronger."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shiloh##br#
"Hogan can single-handedly fight off all of those useless lightning tricks."#br##br#
#&53$Shiloh laughs arrogantly.##npc$$824$1#|
5496|Can't we just talk it out?|
5497|#&7$Shiloh##br#
"No. It all rides on Hogan."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shiloh##br#
"Every time I see Hogan, I can see his pitch-black fur. Oh! That Paco snuck in an electro-attack!"#br##br#
#&53$Shiloh angrily stomps her feet.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Shiloh##br#
"Reid never admits it; he says that Paco's tail gets flattened sometimes by Hogan. The Ham League knows better."#npc$$828$1#|
5498|#&7$Shiloh##br#
"The Ham League may have lost this war, but I will help Hogan make a comeback!"#br##br#
#&53$Shiloh grits her teeth, seething.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Shiloh##br#
"As for the Tanuki, this abandoned mine is unusually good for their den. Hogan used to live here when he was younger! It was a huge pain to lose this place..."#br##br#
#&53$Shiloh sheds a bitter tear.##npc$$829$1#|
5499|#&7$Reid##br#
"We've won, but so many of them are injured. It's so hard to take."#npc$$829$1#|
5500|Retrieve the thermal crystal bottle.|
5501|The cart is empty.

- Proceed to the current quest, "Hatch Dragon Eggs," to receive the items for it.|
5502|Level 60 weapons required.|
5503|#&7$Billy##br#
"Brilliant! Now my dad and I can join the competition! With Blockhead, we will definitely win. Thank you so much!"#npc$$822$1#|
5504|#&7$Reid##br#
"Hm, I hear them squeaking and chirping. There must be a lot of talk going on about the war situation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reid##br#
"How do I know that? Probably because I've been around them for so long. Occasionally I understand them. Over all, it looks like they can make only two kinds of sounds - squeaking and chirping."#npc$$821$1#|
5505|Interesting how the situation has reversed itself!|
5506|Doesn't matter! Any opposition will fall to the might of Hogan!|
5507|Chirp... Squeak!|
5508|#&7$Bulkam##br#
"Power is the most important thing for a robot. If you want to win a robot competition, raise your robot's power to its limit." #npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
5509|You know a thing or two about power. Help Bulkam.|
5510|#&7$Bulkam##br#
"You actually found a Grass Sprite Spore! Awesome! How did you find it? Tell me later, right now let's test this out!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
5511|#&7$Bulkam##br#
"There's a type of fern out in the forest that produces a special Grass Sprite Spore. Putting one of those spores in the robot's fuel can improve its reaction speed, which will give it a huge boost!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Bulkam##br#
"If you find one of these Spores, I'll grind it into a powder and put it in the fuel. I can already see myself as this year's champion!"#npc$$821$1#|
5512|Looks like Kuba needs a hand! Help him investigate the energy.|
5513|#&7$Derek##br#
"Hrm...yep...looks like I'll have to set up here in order to detect potential danger to the camp. This will prevent monsters from ambushing us." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Derek##br#
"It took a lot of energy just to get this far.  Despite that, my results have been, well, disappointing. If only I wasn't so exhausted to climb higher, I could get a better view and be able to detect monsters at a wider range. #npc$$821$1#|
5514|Quite a climb indeed! Help Derek prepare the Detector.|
5515|#&7$Broken Robot##br#
"ALERT! Mechanical Power Core severely damaged. Priority task: immediately change the Mechanical Power Core."#br##br#
#&53$Yikes. This robot seems seriously damaged.##npc$$821$1#|
5516|You're no repair man; best give the Mechanical Power Core to the Robot so that it can fix itself.|
5517|#&7$Derek##br#
"Hmm, you look like you've got a pair of good, strong legs. Getting to the top of that mountain should be a piece of cake for someone like you!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Derek##br#
"If you please, take this Detector and haul it up to the tallest mountain peak behind me. The view from the there will be perfect for the device. Once you're there, just wait for it to do its thing."#npc$$822$1#|
5518|#&7$Derek##br#
"Eh, climbing up that mountain is a breeze. You use the terrain around you to help you along. The double jump will make the journey all the easier. If our Dwarven legs weren't so short, I'd be hopping around everywhere..." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Derek##br#
"There are several peaks in the mountains behind me. Set up the Detector on the tallest one. The device's range will be best there."#npc$$822$1#|
5519|#&7$Stark##br#
"This way I can make my robot move like a human, to possess human agility... Aha! I've devised a great idea!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
5520|Help Stark.|
5521|#&7$Boris##br#
"Sssshh! Don't make a lot of noise; The gorgeous and rare Desert Jerboa lives right in this area. They are also rumored to live north of the Palmgil Oasis. Many have reported seeing only traces of this shy beauty."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Boris##br#
"I'm very interested in the ecology of this species. I have tried many times to catch one, but these buggers are fast! If you go anywhere near one, it will dart into the sand, out of reach. What a great survival skill!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Boris##br#
"I've prepared some nets for catching small critters like this one. Just be patient, wait for a critter to get close enough, then quickly toss the net to catch it. Exciting, I know! You can get started by grabbing a net from the box nearby; good luck!"#npc$$824$1#|
5522|#&7$Stark##br#
"I've been contemplating a way to utilize the robot's full agility, and I've finally devised a solution: I'll transform myself to a robot!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Stark##br#
"To achieve my goal, I must first obtain robot shells. There must be lots of abandoned robots in Ancient Brevis. Their armor should make suitable material."#npc$$821$1#|
5523|#&7$Darwin##br#
"Not much is known about the Sarpa. I must unravel the mystery of their evolution."#npc$$821$1#|
5524|Allow me to lend you a hand.|
5525|#&7$Darwin##br#
"Ah, a fresh set of scales! Thank you! With this, I will sneak into the Sarpa village to observe them."#npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
5526|#&7$Darwin##br#
"The best way to understand the ecology of the Sarpa is to directly observe them as one of their own. These creatures will kill outsiders, so it is imperative that I disguise myself well."#npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Darwin##br#
"Right now I'm making a disguise, but I cannot finish without some Sarpa scales. It would be a tremendous help if you could bring some to me."#npc$$821$1#|
5527|#&53$This goat appears to have been professionally bred; its fur gleams radiantly.##npcs50h+20$$827$1#|
5528|Feed the apple to Princess.|
5529|Carefully show Boris your Desert Jerboa.|
5530|#&7$Bermuda##br#
"I've dedicated my life to the study of animal bones. Once, I stumbled upon the remains of an ancient beast. The possibilities of what it could have been are bountiful; perhaps it was an ancient mountain dragon!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bermuda##br#
"I've spent many long years analyzing this one massive skeleton. To be honest, simply walking across the dig site, crouching and bending constantly to observe the bones, is just too much for me nowadays. I sure hope my next great discovery will be of something a bit...smaller."#npc$$821$1#|
5531|Give the miner the map.|
5532|#&7$Miner##br#
"Hmm...ah, yes, I recognize this... This is a map of the mining tunnels at the mineral area." #br##br#
#&53$The Miner takes a moment to squint at the map, confirming his observation.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Miner##br#
"I once worked that area, until Rock Beetles and Marauders swarmed the place. I had no choice but to escape. Maybe this map was dropped by another miner?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Miner##br#
"You look pretty hardy for battle. Maybe you can do me a small favor? Could you go into the Mine and retrieve my Pickaxe? Everything happened so fast, I - I couldn't get my pickaxe in time. I hoped someone would be kind enough to pick it up for me, but it's still down there."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$How hard could it be? You agree to venture into to the Mine and find his Pickaxe.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Miner##br#
"O-oh! I can't believe it, thank you! Here, if this will help, I'll mark the location of the pickaxe on the map for you."#br##br#
#&53$The Miner scratches a mark on the map.##br##br#
"That'll do it! It should be there. Be careful, the Mine is a dangerous place." #npc$$822$1#|
5533|Gingerly, you pass the Small Skeleton to Bermuda.|
5534|You hoist the pickaxe over to the Miner.|
5535|#&7$Miner##br#
"You've done it! My precious pickaxe... I can't thank you enough for bringing it back."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Miner##br#
"My father gave me this pickaxe. It's not much, not even by a miner's standards, but it means all the world to me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Miner##br#
"This whole time, I've thought, 'If only I stayed behind a moment longer...' Now I can finally sleep, thanks to you."#npc$$822$1#|
5536|#&7$Tia##br#
"The Chamber of Commerce is hosting a party tonight. Everyone will be there. That irritating Sharon will undoubtedly flaunt all her jewelry at me. If I could just get my hands on a Desert Flower,  I'll finally be more radiant than her."#npc$$821$1#|
5537|#&7$Edward##br#
"The creatures nearby have become vicious, fierce, and very relentless. We simply don't have enough people to deal with them day in and day out."#br##br#
#&53$Edward's voice is tight with distress.##M012021s85h+70$$828$1#|
5538|That doesn't sound good for those who live here. How can I help?|
5539|#&7$Edward##br#
"People and animals alike need rest. These monsters don't rest; we can't fight them forever. Robots are a good alternative, except they require refueling and constant maintenance. We just can't afford that, not to mention what would happen if a damaged robot couldn't come back here." #M012021s85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"Luckily, I found an ancient text. It contains instructions on how to create a stone statue monster - minimal maintenance. From this text, I can make a special energy core that can power stone fragments to move like a living statue." #M012021$$824$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"My problem is that the text doesn't mention any detail about the stone fragments themselves. I've tested different rocks and discovered that the Miracle Rock Monsters at the Demarech Pool have the perfect material for making my special guardian." #M012021$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"I need to somehow blast those monsters to bits so that I can use the pieces for the Magic Stone Golem. I'll also need extra pieces for repairs." #M012021$$827$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"If you have some time, I would love for you to be the one that gathers those fragments for me. Would going to the Demarech Pool be too out of your way? Oh, you'll need this Dynamite to shatter a few Miracle Rock Monsters. Collect their fragments and bring them back to me." #M012021$$821$1#|
5540|#&7$Edward##br#
"Did I not give you the dynamite? Go to the Demarech Pool and return with pieces of those Miracle Rock Monsters."#M012021s85h+70$$821$1#|
5541|You return quickly with the pieces.|
5542|#&7$Edward##br#
"Excellent, there are plenty of pieces here! Now to recreate a guardian out of them..."#npc$$821$1#|
5543|Being careful not to crush it, you give Tia the Desert Flower.|
5544|Woah! This Armored Lion is struggling something fierce! Give the Bagged Lion to Hamilton.|
5545|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Brilliant! Let me attempt to tame the beast."#npc$$821$1#|
5546|#&7$Artie##br#
"There is a pristine dragon egg up ahead. Whenever I get close enough to examine it, I get attacked by the nearby Triceragons. I've come this close to losing my life!"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Artie##br#
"I risk my life because this Triceragon Egg will allow us to better understand the ecology of Triceragons. I've watched your approach. You move like someone who will not be so easily deterred from the terrible lunge of a dragon. Perhaps you can fight off the Triceragons while I get the Triceragon Egg."#npc$$821$1#|
5547|#&7$Old Villager##br#
"Since I can remember, this old mine has always been peaceful. Nothing like this has ever happened here before."#npc$$821$1#|
5548|Show the Old Villager the necklace.|
5549|#&7$Old Villager##br#
"This... oh! My necklace... All this time I've thought it lost forever. Where... where did you come across this?"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the Old Villager about how you found the Dirty Accessory.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Old Villager##br#
"So it was there all along!"#br##br#
#&53$The Old Villager's misty gaze grows distant as he continues to speak.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Old Villager##br#
"When I was young, I was once chased into the Mines by monsters while on my way to get the necklace fixed. The chain broke, you see. I guess that's where I lost it..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Old Villager##br#
"This was once my wife's necklace. She's long since passed on, but I thank you for bringing it to me anyway. She would have really appreciated it. I'll place this on her grave. Thank you."#npc$$822$1#|
5550|Eh, why not? Help Artie get the Triceragon Egg.|
5551|Show Mason the Strange Stone. Perhaps he knows what it is for.|
5552|#&7$ Mason##br#
#&53$Mason yelps, clearly frightened.##br##br#
"What is that doing here?! That Shining Stone brings bad luck to anyone foolish enough to hold it! A terrible evil will descend upon you!" #npc$$827$1#

#&7$ Mason##br#
"This Shining Stone was created when a Miracle Stone suddenly changed shape. We don't know too much about it or why it changed the way it did. All we know is if you dig it up, you will become a victim to tragedy. Some think it's just folklore, but I'm not about to test that theory!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Mason##br#
"We must get rid of this thing, quickly and safely. Throw it in a cluster of Miracle Rock Beetles. They'll consume the stone, ridding us of its curse." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$ Mason##br#
"The stone might emit a strange glow when you throw it; hard to tell. If that happens, any creature that swallows it will change. If the Rock Beetles grow more aggressive, you'll have to take them out. This is necessary to kill the stone's curse." #npc$$821$1#|
5553|#&7$Isaias##br#
"I am seeking treasure of the ancients. To do so, I've snagged an item that can lead us in that general direction. The legendary Compass will determine where the treasure is buried." #npc$$821$1#|
5554|#&7$Harry##br#
"Just because I'm young doesn't mean I'm helpless. When it comes to fightin' the so-called danger outside, I'm just about as good as any of these old farts."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harry##br#
"What, don't believe me? I can prove it to ya! Check out my awesome slingshot; it'll take down anything!"#npc$$821$1#|
5555|If your slingshot is as good as you claim it to be, perhaps you'd like to help me create your best one.|
5556|#&7$Harry##br#
"Heh, whatever. Alright, I'll help ya. Then you'll see how amazing my slingshots really are. I'm gonna need some good materials, though. I mean really good! Like, the best." #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Harry the Bifurcated Twig you've found.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Harry##br#
"Eh, this is alright, I guess. It'll do. Now watch! I'll make you something awesome!"#br##br#
#&53$Unable to hold back his excitement, Harry gathers the materials and dives into his work.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harry##br#
"Alright, done! This is definitely my best slingshot ever! Which means it is THE best slingshot ever! Go ahead and test it. Those annoying Scavenger Birds southeast of the Demarech Pool will make great practice." #npc$$824$1#|
5557|#&7$Harry##br#
"Man, those scavenger birds are a pain. That's ok, though.  With the branches, stone chunks and mud you got, I can make you somethin' that will definitely fix the problem."#npc$$821$1#|
5558|Give Rebecca her notebook.|
5559|#&7$Rebecca##br#
"I've been traveling every since I was young. I loved it so much, I decided to record every location I've been to. I've always aspired to become a guide."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"This notebook contains everything I've learned about the Demarech Mine.  Last time I was there, I got distracted enough to actually leave it behind.  I'm so glad that you grabbed it for me." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"Say, are you busy? I could use your help with something." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"Going back to that notebook, there are still two locations in the Mines that I haven't recorded any details of. The first place is the Mineral Area to the northwest. The other is the Caerment Altar to the east." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"I'd go back myself, but I'm already behind schedule. I hope you agree to this! I just need you to go to these two locations and write down everything you can about them. Then my notes on the Demarech Mines will finally be complete." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"I can't remember the last time I've met anyone so kind. You really are willing to travel all that way just to get me some notes! Perhaps the people in this world aren't so bad after all!" #npc$$824$1#|
5560|Steadily, you give Isaias the Compass.|
5561|Well, I took as many notes as I could about the locations you specified.|
5562|#&7$Rebecca##br#
"Wow, you're back already! Let me see what sort of notes you took."#br##br#
#&53$Rebecca takes the manuscript, reading it carefully.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"This is really good...such detail.... I definitely didn't expect this. Perhaps you, too, are destined to be a guide someday. You've definitely earned this; take this guide badge as a proof of your excellence."#npc$$821$1#|
5563|#&7$Ada##br#
"I'm so lucky; I've found the desert bandits' secret treasure trove! There has to be a mountain of treasure inside. There's no way I can carry it all on my own. Hey, if you're willing to help out, I'll give you half of what we take!" #npc$$824$1#|
5564|#&7$ Wandering Villager##br#
"Ohhh, no... please don't leave me here...." #br##br#
#&53$With a despairing look, the villager beckons to the distance as though calling out to someone, but who?##npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Wandering Villager##br#
"A-aaah, wait...! Please...wait for me..." #br##br#
#&53$The Villager continues to call out to someone, but there is no one else around.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask who he is talking to, but he ignores you as though you aren't even there. He continues to stare off into the distance, lost and transfixed, as though under a spell.##br#
#char$$821$0#|
5565|Half of what you both can carry? Heck yeah! You decide to help Ada.|
5566|#&7$Morris##br#
"The altar near here holds hundreds, maybe even thousands of years of history. It took weeks of research, but I think I've found a way to access it!"#npcs85h+70$$824$1#

#&7$Morris##br#
"There's supposed to be some sort of key. I just don't know where that key is or what will happen after I find and use it. You may have noticed a triangular indentation on the altar. I'm thinking that's where the key, if it still exists, is supposed to go."#npc$$821$1#|
5567|Carefully give Morris the Tiny Pyramid.|
5568|Proudly show Tanner Jones your captured Mountain Dimetrodon.|
5569|#&7$Tanner Jones##br#
"Oh, ho! So you figured out how to use the trap and you were able to set it up in the correct area. You could just as easily have been Dimetrodon food."#br##br#
#&53$With raised eyebrows and a steady gaze on your catch, Tanner seems surprised that you brought back a Dimetrodon by yourself.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner Jones##br#
"Perhaps I underestimated your abilities as a hunter. You have skills, strength and, most importantly, guts. If you're ever interested in joining us, let me know."#npc$$824$1#|
5570|#&7$Marvin##br#
"I am a traveler who has vowed to taste every delicacy this entire world has to offer. There is a type of cactus that grows only on the Cactus Plateau. Its taste is very unique, but oh-so-good! Unforgettable. I have traveled all the way here for some of that cactus.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I just wish there weren't so many dangerous Rexes preventing me from this delicacy! I don't know how I can survive the trip, but fortunately you're here! If you happen across this special cactus, could you bring some of it back to me?"#npc$$821$1#|
5571|Hand Kara the Stout and Beef.|
5572|#&7$Kara##br#
"You...actually brought those nasty ingredients back..." #br##br#
#&53$Kara's face twists in disgust.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"No one in their right mind would think to actually make something appetizing out of these two ingredients. I'm a darn good cook, but never good enough to try it for myself. However, there is someone crazy enough to want to taste Stone Hammer Giant food. He says it's his goal to try the foods of every race." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"No one has had a strong enough stomach to actually get those ingredients until you came along. As such, I'll force myself to make something from this!" #br##br#
#&53$Determined, Kara turns around to prepare the meal.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Whew, I actually finished! I won't say anything about the taste, but please deliver this to Marvin at the edge of the Hunters' Mountain Village so that he can try it. He claims to have been wanting to try this particular dish for a long time. The man must be crazy." #npc$$824$1#|
5573|#&7$Kara##br#
"Stout and Beef are normally not bad. Stout and Beef from Stone Hammer Giants, however, is disgusting. But, of course, even the most disgusting thing in the world has someone crazy enough to want to eat it. I don't know how Marvin has stomached half of the things he claims to have tried." #npc$$821$1#|
5574|#&7$Marvin##br#
"I love traveling! Seeing new places, experiencing new cultures, especially the delicious, exotic foods!"#npc$$821$1#|
5575|Offer Marvin some Stout Beef Stew.|
5576|#&7$Marvin##br#
"Is that Stout Beef Stew? I've heard of this! Always wanted to try it. Allow me a taste..."#npc$$821$1#|
5577|#&7$Bernard##br#
"The Sand Owl Bandits have recently bolstered their numbers. Many caravan members have been attacked by them, yet most of my team avoided injury. The boss wants my team to take care of the situation and strengthen our desert patrol." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bernard##br#
"But...but they're all on leave! I would have never sent them all away at once if I knew I was gonna get this kind of order. How am I supposed to call them back? I don't even know where they are!" #npc$$821$1#|
5578|Could you lend me a bow and some arrows?|
5579|#&7$Simone##br#
"I don't care what people say, a good hunter uses a bow and arrow. You think you've got what it takes? Go ahead and use this bow. There are Toucants to the north you can practice on."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Remember, don't shoot too quickly. Take aim at one Toucant, then wait for other Toucants to step into the line of fire between you and your target. Once that happens, let the arrow go."#npc$$821$1#|
5580|#&7$Simone##br#
"Already bowing down? Go north and use the bow and arrows to practice on a Toucant."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"You must be nervous. As I said, equip this bow and arrows and aim at a Toucant. When another bird enters your line-of-sight, release the arrow."#npc$$821$1#|
5581|I believe this book is yours.|
5582|#&7$Alain##br#
"Ah! Give that back!"#br##br#
#&53$Alain snatches the book from you.##npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"All my old inventions are here. Did you read this? Did anyone else?"#npc$$821$1#

#&53$You quickly tell Alain that no one has read the book.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Good! Why didn't I destroy these notes sooner? Don't tell anyone about what's inside this!"#npc$$821$1#|
5583|Talk about bad timing. Help Bernard call back his team members.|
5584|#&7$Blingham##br#
"To succeed in battle, you must first know yourself, for war pressures your limits, strengths and weaknesses. Only then can you defeat your strongest foes."#npc$$821$1#

"This waterfall thrums with spiritual power. Stand beneath it and meditate. You will precipitate your own specter and exert your own potential with it."#npc$$821$1#|
5585|Help Posey.|
5586|#&7$Posey##br#
"There's a plant called the Purple Lotus. It only grows in Alba Shoal. The flower withers within moments after being picked, which makes this a rare flower indeed."#npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Posey##br#
"Here is a flask. If you find a Purple Lotus, put it in this flask to prevent it from withering and bring it to me. It could be a key component for refining the ultimate fuel!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
5587|#&7$Posey##br#
"Quickly, find the rare Purple Lotus, near Alba Shoal! Remember that you must keep the flower in this flask to prevent it from withering."#npc$$821$1#|
5588|Give Posey the flask containing the Purple Lotus. Hopefully there are no cracks on the glass!|
5589|#&7$Posey##br#
"Oh good, the flower is preserved. You sealed the flask well, thank you! Now I can continue research on refined fuel.#npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Posey##br#
"However... if I remove this flower from the flask, it'll wither. Hmm... how to get around this little problem..." #br##br#
#&53$Posey falls deep into thought, forgetting your presence.##npc$$828$1#|
5590|#&7$Bernard##br#
"The higher-ups all-of-a-sudden want me to gather my team, after I've sent them all away. I guess there's something really important we need to do. I have to wait here for them, otherwise how are we all gonna meet up? It would be great if you can help me spread the word that they need to assemble." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bernard##br#
"Their names are Kasim, Natasha and Macallan. They left just this morning, so they should hopefully still be in Palmgil Oasis. Here are the orders, in case they ask. As soon as they see those papers, they'll know to report for duty ASAP." #npc$$821$1#|
5591|Is that where the Grass Kingdom is?|
5592|Why is Zinnia electrified?|
5593|Must Cole always yell?|
5594|There's definitely something different about Rehia.|
5595|Does Moe wear anything other than metal armor?|
5596|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"The Grass Kingdom is a distant land, shaped by the will of the wind. Our princess refuses to marry the prince of the Mushroom Kingdom. Like the wind, she prefers to travel the world, so she ran away."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#

5597|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Her Majesty is no ordinary princess; she is considered an icon of bravery in this country. She is able to cast the legendary electrical spell, the Judgement Bolt. But she is still so young! She cannot quite control the spell yet... At times she'll accidentally  unleash the spell, creating a damaging explosion."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
5598|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Its is perhaps best not to ask."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
5599|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Rehia is our master archmage's only disciple, powerful enough to harness the might of flame and ice. However, Rehia also lacks focus, accidentally burning nearby citizens on occasion. It is unfortunate that she is only interested in playing with dolls..."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
5600|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Moe lost his right hand in a tragic accident. We Sprouts are able to regrow limbs that we lose, so I don't know why he is so determined to encase his body within iron. It is rumored that he is doing it to protect his relationship with someone."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
5601|#&7$First Village Chief##br#
"Salutations! I'm known as the First Village Chief. Our village boasts the best persons in every area except for the strongest person. Perhaps you are that particular individual, hmm?"#npc$$821$1#|
5602|#&7$First Village Resident##br#
"I never wanted to come here; this place gives me the creeps! We need the best exterminator out here to kill these bugs."#npc$$821$1#|
5603|#&7$First Village Resident##br#
"I am the most noble person in the world! I shouldn't have to touch such disgusting spiders!"#npc$$826$1#|
5604|#&7$First Village Scholar##br#
"Knowing more than anyone else in the world and creating the best encyclopedia are my life goals. Did you know that the smelly arachnid's silk is the toughest in the world?"#npc$$821$1#|
5605|Give back the necklace, Gump. You'll get sick if you wear it for too long.|
5606|Oh, you're sick? Then hurry and take off the necklace!|
5607|What?! You want to take off my head? You're misunderstanding things...|
5608|Defeat this crazy idiot!|
5609|#&7$Exedore##br#
"Does anyone even study penguin magic anymore? I'm getting too old... If I don't find a disciple soon, the title of Penguin Mage will be lost..."#br##br#
#&53$Exedore mutters under his breath.##npc$$821$1#|
5610|#&7$First Village Chief##br#
"These bugs are so dangerous! The village will be destroyed before we know it! Hurry, help us!"#npc$$829$1#|
5611|Mix the Aroma Grass to make an Aroma Spray.|
5612|#&7$Exedore##br#
"Ah! Now to mix the Aroma Grass."#br##br#
#&53$Exedore conjures mixing tools.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"Aroma Grass in sprigs, Fish Jerky in sticks, first twist, then lick, then soak in penguin spit!"#br##br#
#&53$The potion emits a foul odor.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"Potion's in this vial. Use it to discipline difficult penguins. They hate the smell."#npc$$821$1#|
5613|#&7$Exedore##br#
"I'm afraid this isn't enough Aroma Grass... I can't make the potion without the proper ingredients."#br##br#
#&53$- Collect sprigs of Aroma Grass near the water at the south.##npc$$826$1#|
5614|How do I draw it out? (Pick up quest item.)|
5615|#&7$Exedore##br#
Place these enchanted jars in front of him. When he tries to smash them, we'll lure him away."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"I'll telepathically guide you to the precise moment and location to place the jars. Follow directions and you'll be fine!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"Oh yes, don't get too close to Gump. His aura is toxic to humans."#npc$$823$1#|
5616|These penguins are such cheaters!|
5617|#&7$Exedore##br#
"These are Gump's companions. Though their demonic corruption is only slight, they attack everyone.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"Let's get these penguins out of here! Otherwise, when we draw Gump here, they'll become more vicious." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"Gump is on his way. Try not to make any mistakes; the penguins may take advantage of that."#npc$$821$1#|
5618|It's alright; come a little closer.|
5619|My penguins are injured!|
5620|Whew! Thanks for saving me.|
5621|Stop hitting me! This is what I get for stealing your fish jerky!|
5622|If I had fish jerky left to give, I would have given it to you!|
5623|My back! Argh, it hurts!|
5624|Ouch! Quit hitting me, you foul thing!|
5625|That's not really necessary...|
5626|#&7$Penguin Villager##br#
"Oh no! These little devils just won't stop! I cant' stand it!"#br##br#
#&53$A frantic Penguin Villager cries out in despair.##npc$$823$1#|

5628|#&7$Penguin Villager##br#
"They live here, too. We can't teach these penguins a lesson."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Penguin Villager##br#
"If we punish the penguins, we'll be cursed by the elder."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penguin Villager##br#
"Because of these penguins, travelers actually visit this village. So, there's nothing we can do to rid ourselves of their antics."#npc$$823$1#|
5629|#&7$Superior Sprite##br#
"I am so glad you're here! This is the altar where sprites pray to keep nature at a balance. If Demons had corrupted this place with their foul rituals, nature's balance would have fallen, resulting in the world's destruction!" #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Superior Sprite##br#
"So, on behalf of all the sprites and the world, thank you!"#npc$$2$1#|
5630|#&7$Demon Recruit##br#
"What are you here for? An important ritual is about to begin! Unless it's important, scram!"#npc$$827$1#|
5631|#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"The demon army swept through here... We were not strong enough to resist. Why did they have to take my sister? Oh, if only there was someone strong enough to help us!"#npc$$829$1#|
5632|I'm just the person you need.|
5633|#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"Oh, thank you! Thank you! Please, be careful! They'll kill you if you're not!"#npc$$822$1#|
5634|How dare you defy me after what you've done! I'll teach you a lesson!|
5635|#&7$Demon Recruit##br#
"Such confidence! Alert the king! The enemy has invaded. Prepare for battle!"#npc$$2012$1#|
5636|Food delivery! Please, let me through.|

5638|#&7$Demon Recruit##br#
"Huh, food? Do you take me for a complete fool? We did not order any food! You're an imposter! Prepare to die!"#npc$$2012$1#|
5639|I've only come to find something, not to deal with these strange monsters...|

"We were performing a blessing ritual. Travelers from the Grass Kingdom were passing through; they joined us."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tiramisu##br#
"A small sprout began to conjure magic. She disrupted the ritual, summoning Fallen Sprites."#npc$$821$1#

"Now many villagers are trapped! Please help us save them!"#npc$$821$1#|
5641|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"The princess came to join us at the blessing ritual. However, she lost control of her power."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"When released, her magic creates a lot of electricity. This is what disrupted the ritual."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Surprisingly, Fallen Sprites were summoned. Now the princess and the others are trapped. Please help!"#npc$$821$1#|
5642|I'm here. How can I help?|
5643|#&7$Exedore##br#
"Ah! Finally! As you can see, these penguins have gone insane, terrorizing the villagers!"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"We need to focus on stopping Gump. Somehow, he has acquired the Demon King's Eye necklace, which is making all the penguins go berserk. They're now much larger and they emit an aura that makes those around them sick. Be careful when you get close to any of them."#br##br#
#&53$Exedore shakily strokes his beard in contemplative distress, then continues.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"Perhaps you can lure Gump away from the penguins. He is near the altar deep inside the village." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"Try to lead it to the small bridge. I will then step in to temporarily suppress his aura in order to take the necklace from him." #npc$$821$1#|
5644|#&7$Exedore##br#
"Does penguin magic interest you? You display a lot of potential. You could easily harness the essence of penguin magic."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Exedore##br#
"If you wish to learn, you must first sever all contact with the penguins. After that, the only one you can be in contact with is..."#br##br#
#&53$Not having the patience, you mumble an excuse to leave.##npc$$823$1#|

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" #npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
5648|#&7$Rehia##br#
"Please, that has nothing to do with me! At most, I was only trying to cook seafood. So I may have accidentally set fire to a few houses. That's no big deal!"#npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
5649|#&7$Moe##br#

"You actually made it... Usually, our youth never stick around. It's unfortunate, 'cause our ceremony requires stamina and strength."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"Kargula's our deity. He'll command you through the upcoming trials. You'll fail some, succeed in others, so long as you finish. The village will fall to ruin otherwise." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"Lemme know when you're ready." #npc$$824$1#|
5659|Hold on! I NEED to know what this ceremony entails! (Important! Must read!)|
5660|#&7$Milton##br#
"What it entails...? OH! I had almost forgotten! Would have been a problem if you didn't know what's going on, eh? Then we'd really be in trouble!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"Anyway, once you begin, you have to run up the mountain and knock down every flag you see along the way."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"Every time you knock down a flag, you begin a trial. Kargula will summon avatars around the flag. Listen to what Kargula says to know which avatar is different from the others; that's the one you want to defeat."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"If no matter what you do, you just can't seem to beat up your target, it's probably the wrong one. Just take a breath and target another."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"Once you have knocked down all seven flags, go to the altar for your final trial. Continuous waves of avatars will pour out of that altar. Like before, just target the one that is different from the rest."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"Make sense? Let me know when you're ready to begin. Good luck, you're gonna need it."#npc$$821$1#|
5661|Let's get these trials started!|
5662|The Kargula Ceremony now commences!|
5663|All villagers are asked to proceed to the altar.|
5664|Hey, a young person! Awesome!|
5665|You can do it! Go-go!|
5666|Don't give up! The future of the village is in your hands.|
5667|Stay cool, stay calm, and win!|
5668|Failure is a hindrance! Succeed!|
5669|This is so straight-forward, relax! Don't worry!|
5670|Don't be nervous. Take a deep breath and take the time to observe.|
5671|Grandma, I can read the words! That phantom...|
5672|Shhh! Don't say the words! Don't you dare make the god think you've cheated!|
5673|It's difficult to see with everything so far away. Once they are closer, it'll be easier.|
5674|I can't turn back now! I can't give in! Father is depending on me! I must make him proud, make him smile!|
5675|#&7$Cave-Dwelling Miner##br#
"The spiders in this cave are as crafty as thieves in a museum. They stay hidden until we miners start working, then they suddenly attack us. I'm crazy to still be here."#npc$$828$1#|
5676|You ask the miner if you can try using the shovel.|
5677|#&7$Cave-Dwelling Miner##br#
"Hah! You want to try it out, even after what I've said about the spiders? You're an interesting kind of crazy, so you ought to know that those spiders like to work in groups. So, watch yourself. I'm not crazy enough to save you if you get bitten!"#npc$$821$1#|
5678|#&7$Cave-Dwelling Miner##br#
"Having second thoughts about that shovel? No? Well, go on, then. You already know about the spiders, so now it's just a matter of getting to the nitty-gritty..."#npc$$828$1#|
5679|#&7$Cave Dwelling Foreman##br#
"Gah! Nearly scared me out of my wits!"#npc$$829$1#|
5680|Woah! A giant spider just appeared out of nowhere. I nearly jumped out of my skin! It's probably poisonous.|
5681|Does anyone know where I can find some mushrooms? Otherwise, I might have to find a way to pay...|
5682|Oh no! The gold disappeared!|
5683|I have to find it, it's important!|
5684|Oh no, it's not here! Maybe it's over there.|
5685|Not here either! Maybe it's further on.|
5686|I can't resign to losing that gold! I have to keep looking, nothing can be done without it.|
5687|Still no gold. Where could it be?|
5688|Lets face it; the gold is lost. I've looked everywhere! What will happen? A comeback cannot happen without that gold.|
5689|What will I do without that gold?|
5690|I ran as fast as I could to fetch the best Scrumptious Mushrooms. Ready for what's next!|
5691|#&7$Sheldon##br#
"I'm so glad we got the gold back! Now we can stage a comeback. Thank you so much! Now I know what to do in case this happens again!" #npc$$825$1#|
5692|#&7$Sheldon##br#
"If they keep this up, they'll eat me out of house and home! Please help!" #npc$$829$1#|
5693|Mmm, that was delicious!|
5694|Simply divine.|
5695|My entire hoard of gold will be eaten if they continue like this.|
5696|#&7$Golden Flowertrap##br#
"...(Gnawing and gnashing noises)" #M019040$Golden Flowertrap$101$1#|
5697|Grab a Golden Flowertrap's attention and lure it with a Scrumptious Mushroom.|
5698|#&7$Golden Flowertrap##br#
"Oh, what's tha--ahh!"#br##br#
#&53$(Golden Flowertrap breaks into a frenzy after catching sight of the Scrumptious Mushroom.)##npc$$101$1#|
5699|#&7$Golden Flowertrap##br#
"...... (It pays you no mind as it continues its voracious eating.)" #br##br#
#&53$As you recall Sheldon's words, you begin to second-guess your methods of luring out Golden Flowertraps.##M019040$Golden Flowertrap$101$1#|
5700|So you have Sheldon's private stash of Mushrooms. Give them to me now!|
5701|#&7$Merchant's Assistant##br#
"I hear you're very brave - brave enough to dig up those mushrooms to save us. I want to thank you for your hard work, but I must ask if you can also deal with the Eater of Gold." #npc$$824$1#|
5702|#&7$Merchant's Assistant##br#
"Oh, you're still here. Please, please save my master's wealth! If the money is eaten, we will go hungry!" #npc$$829$1#|
5703|Whew... Hope I got here fast enough!|
5704|Hmm, clockwise or counterclockwise? Maybe it's clockwise.|
5705|The final test is up ahead!|
5706|There are two stages to the final test.|
5707|The first stage involves repeating the previous seven tests.|
5708|You can only fail three times, otherwise you must start over.|
5709|In the second stage, you face off against the wrath of Kargula.|
5710|Put all your might into defeating this god!|
5711|Ready? Knock down that flag!|
5712|You've persevered, young one.|
5713|#&7$Durango##br#
"Hello, I am Durango, Wilhelm's assistant; I'm in charge of Receiving. I've heard many tales of your heroics. With someone as extraordinary as yourself helping us, we'll be able to retrieve our goods in no time." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Durango##br#
"The pirates standing guard are distracted, and most of our goods are packed and ready. Awfully kind of the pirates, eh? We'll leave on your signal." #npc$$821$1#|
5714|I'm ready to go.|
5715|#&7$Durango##br#
"Very good. Let's get out of here." #npc$$821$1#|
5716|#&7$Wilhelm##br#
"I am grateful for your help. When Giant Jordan realized our delay, he began attacking us. After defeating several guards, he and his underlings just left. We couldn't catch them." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wilhelm##br#
"I thought our efforts futile, but the rumors of your power are true! You were able to defeat him." #npc$$821$1#|
5717|You better return! Otherwise you'll be sorry...|
5718|How rude! Just because your mother isn't here doesn't give you the right to talk nonsense!|
5719|What a dedicated individual!|
5720|When I grow up, I'll pass the trials, too!|
5721|Took you long enough! We've been waiting forever.|
5722|#&7$Pete##br#
"The world of the Secret Stone is profound, a prelude to its title. I'm the person to seek if you want to learn of its secrets." #npc$$821$1#|
5723|I want to embed, extract or upgrade a Secret Stone.|
5724|#&7$Barlo##br#
"There are many Falco tribes, and they are all as violent as the Red Colts. As such, these tribes fight each other and are scorned by the other clans. If would benefit the Falcos if we could remedy this problem."#npc$$821$1#|
5725|#&7$Jimala##br#
"My brother is too kind for his own good. When the Red Colts and others try to invade us, my brother simply drives them away. He has not once tried to kill an enemy. As honorable as that is, we cannot continue this way..." #npc$$823$1#|
5726|#&7$Kafei##br#
"Hmph, brother is always so foolish, always trying to be good, but the other tribes don't know how strong we are this way. If I was calling the shots, the other tribes would know not to mess with the Falcos." #npc$$823$1#|
5727|#&7$Chidan##br#
"Jimala and Kafei may not agree with how our leader governs us, but his methods are virtuous and honorable. As a result, we grow in number, becoming stronger. When our time comes, the enemy will know their place." #npc$$823$1#|
5728|#&7$Barlo##br#
"My brothers and I have stopped our thievery, so the Red Colts have taken advantage of this. They've captured many of our warriors. We will be stronger if they are rescued. Please help us."#npc$$821$1#|
5729|Please give me another curse. (Quest: Dark Visions)|
5730|#&7$Hazel##br#
"Please be careful with it. The process for creating a curse is not an easy one." #npc$$821$1#|
5731|#&7$Hazel##br#
"I would not even bother giving this to you if it wasn't  needed." #br##br#
#&53$- Must accept quest: Dark Visions with enough room in your inventory for the curse.#|
5732|Don't worry, Paco. I've come to find help.|
5733|No problem! Let's pass the test together!|
5734|Thanks! Let's get started!|
5735|Give the Flower Crown to the Sprite and ask her to give it the Blessing of Sprites.|
5736|#&7$Sprite##br#
"Traveler, your blessing has already been granted. Please use it as a source of courage next time you are faced with trouble. Any problem can be solved with courage; I know this has been true for me." #npc$$2$1#|
5737|#&7$Sprite##br#
"Traveler, you have passed the rites. I will grant you a blessing, but I sense it is an item you would rather have me bless instead. Show it to me." #npc$$2$1#|
5738|Only your beauty is worthy enough to wear a radiant flower such as this. By recognizing your own radiance, am I allowed to pass?|
5739|#&7$Priestess##br#
"Oh! This is my precious Altar Flower. Normally I am not persuaded to grant passage by any flower, no matter how beautiful, but I'll make an exception. Remember that I am allowing this because of the flower, not because of you!" #npc$$825$1#|
5740|#&7$Priestess##br#
"As a priestess who takes her role seriously, I have diligently guarded the entrance to the altar. You think flowery words are enough to falter my duty? Also...where are the flowers...?" #npc$$827$1#|
5741|I gave you the flowers, now let me through!|
5742|#&7$Priestess##br#
"This world is overpopulated with people who don't know manners. It is common sense to ask politely for someone to do something for you." #npc$$821$1#|
5743|Ye-ouch! Perhaps I can't pass this test after all.|
5744|#&7$Stanley##br#
"Such strength; you're a true warrior! I worried about you, so I rushed here; that was unnecessary."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
"If I had delayed for just a moment in getting my comrade to sick bay..."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
"On behalf of the team, thanks! You inspire us to improve so that we'll be able to help others as you have." #npc$$822$1#|
5745|#&7$Stanley##br#
"Our task force has orders to find the sword of an ancient lord. None of us expected Lingering Spirits to ambush us at the door!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
"Monsters and machines are everywhere in there. It wouldn't surprise me if tomb builders purposely set them up to guard against tomb raiders."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to take my comrades to the emergency ward or they won't make it through the night with their wounds. That is why I've been looking for help."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
If you can, remove the circuit on the device and go deep into Old Tomb to find the Ancient Lord's Sword. We'll meet up after I get the injured to safety!"#npc$$824$1#|
5746|#&7$Zane##br#
"The device is activated. Lingering
Spirits have begun to appear; soon they will swarm the place!"#npc$$821$1




#&7$Zane##br#
"Stanley managed to take out two
before he was overrun. He's still holding his ground, but just barely. Hunter
got injured during the skirmish." 



#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Zane##br#
"I guess the plan is for
you to deactivate the device while Stanley rescues Hunter and I stay here so
that those monsters won't attack from the rear. Please, be careful!"#npc$$824$1#|
5747|#&7$Zane##br#
"Because of you, we were able to complete our mission and rescue our injured comrade. You have our thanks!" #npc$$82$1#

#&7$Zane##br#
"I have to keep training hard so that I won't be a burden to my comrades!" #npc$$824$1#|
5748|You must be here to help! I have to protect my comrade from further attacks, so please help me defeat the Lingering Spirits!|
5749|(I see a strange light; something must have happened there.)|
5750|#&7$Koral##br#
"Why are evil folks always the ones that abuse animate magic? They give life to foolish things like Zombies and such. How do the laws of nature even allow for such a thing?" #br##br#
#&53$Koral mutters fretfully to himself.##npcs85h+70$$828$1#|
5751|Where are those that are disturbing the ruins?|
5752|#&7$Koral##br#
"The purpose of this underground temple is to seal a magical taboo. This magic is so powerful that it could destroy the balance of this world. For centuries, we have diligently guarded this place." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
"Recently, however, a talented mage by the name of Bergen ran into the ruins, mysteriously bewitched. He summoned many Stone Golems who rampaged against the guardians." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
Now he's trying to get those Golems to break the sealed gate deep in the ruins. Fortunately, the gate is solid enough to give us a bit of time to stop him." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
"I just wish there weren't so many stone golems; we can't get inside and they make it impossible for whoever's trapped in there to return. Maybe, with your battle experience, you'll be able to help us." #npc$$827$1#|
5753|This means I can't just walk in, right?|
5754|#&7$Koral##br#
"Completely out of the question!"#br##br#
#&53$Koral sighs, looking dejected.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
"Dealing with the Golems out here isn't too difficult, but the area around the gate is thick with them. I've never seen so many summoned Golems at once. With just one order from Bergen, all of those Golems together could easily crush you." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
"Fortunately, I have a plan, and that is why I can confidently ask you to help us." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
"Every Golem here runs by their own Magic Energy Core Bergen uses to control them. All you have to do is defeat the Golems out here and bring me the Magic Energy Cores you'll collect from them. I'll need at least six cores for my plan to work."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
"Once we have them, we'll take them to the Altar southwest of here. From there, I'll be able to use the altar to analyze the structure of the Golems' magic. Once I figure out how to remove the energy from those Cores, dealing with the rest of the Golems will be easy." #br##br#
#&53$Koral throws back his shoulders and nods his head in confidence.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Koral##br#
"Once you're ready, go on ahead! I'll finish up a few things here and then I'll join you."#npc$$821$1#|
5755|Ok, I've got the Magic Energy Cores you need!|
5756|#&7$Koral##br#
"No, that's an unacceptable amount of Cores. I need you to kill more Golems for me."#br##br#

#&53$* Make sure you have at least six empty slots in your Backpack.#|
5757|Oh, I'm very glad this altar hasn't been destroyed! I can use this...|
5758|Let me know when you have six Magic Energy Cores.|
5759|Please wait a moment; I'm beginning the analysis.|
5760|First thing's first... The elementary component... yes, now...|
5761|Whew... I've got some of this figured out already...|
5762|Hmm... I can sense a concentrated amount of elemental magic seeping from the earth...|
5763|Wait... This energy... It's also... N-no, it can't be!|
5764|I-I need more time to analyze this magic...|
5765|I could really use to have more of those Golems destroyed...|
5766|If there are too many, don't force yourself to fight them all; you'll never win that way.|
5767|Once I'm ready and set, I'll take care of them!|
5768|I'll stay here to practice a few counter-magic spells. Go ahead to the ruins and wait for me there.|

"With Candeo Marsh coffee, a little will carry you through the whole day! With its crisp aroma, why don't you try some?"#npc$$821$1#|
5856|#&7$Kai##br#
"Looking for a hearty meal? Try some of my Ventos Special Steak. Nothing satisfies like a plate of my hearty home cooking." #npc$$821$1#|
5857|#&7$Kronk##br#
"Yeah, I've tried some of that fancy Demarech Mines mead. If you want something strong with a balanced flavor, try my Dark Brew made from the Ventos Prairie. This mead has critically acclaimed taste!" #npc$$825$1#|
5858|#&7$Lizzy##br#
"I may be just an apprentice, but our chef claims there are no better meatballs in existence than my meatballs! Their sweet and sour flavor will want you craving more, I guarantee it." #npc$$824$1#|
5859|#&7$Summer##br#
"My sister Lizzy and I dream of opening our own restaurant together. To make our dream come true, I am developing the perfect drink to go with my sister's meatballs. I think I've found it with my Nepenthe Tea. You must try some!"#br##br#
#&53$Summer's gaze shines with hope.##npc$$821$1#|
5860|#&7$Doyle##br#
"I probably shouldn't brag.  After all, I'm just an apprentice. But I know I'll someday be the best baker in the world!"#br##br#
#&53$Doyle's lips lift into a beaming smile.##npc$$824$1#|
5861|#&7$Barney##br#
"My brother Doyle aims to be the best baker in the world, so I will become the best beverage expert, with the most delicious fruit tea to accompany my brother's pastries. It is only fitting for someone from the Palmgil Oasis." #npc$$824$1#|
5862|#&7$Rick##br#
"Navea's cuisine is as ancient and everlasting as the city itself, so every dish holds a unique feature and history. When you tour the city, be sure to sample all of its flavorful foods." #npc$$821$1#|
5863|#&7$Lois##br#
"In Navea, liquor is just as popular as food. Many of the city's cocktails are named after its important landmarks. Shall I mix you something?"#npc$$821$1#|
5864|What happened?|
5865|#&7$Watson##br#
"You've obviously accepted my request. That's why you're standing here now, is it not? This will spare me from cumbersome explanations."#br##br#
#&53$Watson pauses to collect his thoughts.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Watson##br#
"As you probably know, I am chasing a demonic group called the 'Bloody Cult'. I received intel that Mayin had come here. Of course I pursued him, why would I not? So I immediately set out to this place."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Watson##br#
"I never imagined Mayin could disguise himself so well as a villager. I couldn't see through his disguise, so he managed to ambush me. My wounds are serious. If not for you, I'd be dead."#br#
#&53$Watson's smile is slight, though his gaze softens with appreciation.##npc$$828$1#|
5866|What would you like me to do?|
5867|#&7$Watson##br#
"If I'm right, Mayin's men are also disguised as villagers."#br##br#
#&53$Watson tightens his jaw, looking pale yet determined.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Watson##br#
"If I use my ability, 'Holy Light Cross', I can easily reveal them for the filthy demons they are."#br##br#
#&53$Watson lifts his voice, excited and hopeful, though he seems to have a bit of difficulty breathing.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Watson##br#
"Buy me some time by checking if the village ahead of us has also been infiltrated by Demons."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Watson##br#
"While you do that, I'll see to my wounds. As soon as I'm recovered, I'll...(cough)... catch up...(cough...cough...)"#br##br#
#&53$Watson breaks into a heavy spasm of coughing.##npc$$501$1#|
5868|Gaia be with me.|
5869|#&7$Watson##br#
"Ray of Justice! Bless us with your holy protection!"#br##br#
#&53$As Watson's voice rings in the air, you feel warm energy radiate inside you.##npc$$2012$1#

#&7$Watson##br#
"The holy power that drives away darkness is yours! Use it to vanquish those demons!"#npc$$822$1#|
5870|Attempt to hold a conversation with some of the residents.|
5871|#&7$Watson##br#
"You've come... just in time..."#br##br#
#&53$Watson gasps for breath, looking frazzled.##npc$$1$1#|
5872|#&7$Watson##br#
"Elaine, Jules! It's been too long! Feels just like old times. I try to show off, and you come to my rescue."#br##br#
#&53$Watson manages a sheepish smile, looking quite embarrassed.##npc$$828$1#|
5873|#&7$Lucien##br#
"Hmm... you don't look familiar... You're not from around here, are you?"#br##br#
#&53$Lucien scrutinizes you suspiciously.##npc$$1$1#|
5874|#&7$Garner##br#
"These badlands usually don't see visitors, being so out of the way and all. Seeing you here is quite rare!"#br##br#
#&53$Garner smiles politely.##npc$$1$1#|
5875|#&7$Uli##br#
"I don't wanna talk to the likes of you; don't even think it!"#br##br#
#&53$Uli glares with contempt.##npc$$827$1#|
5876|#&7$Anne##br#
"My my, I can't remember the last time anyone has stopped by these parts! What brings you here, young traveler?"#br##br#
#&53$Anne speaks slowly, with a kind, soft voice.##npc$$821$1#|
5877|#&7$Roscoe##br#
"Sorry, not supposed to talk to strangers!"#br##br#
#&53$Roscoe gives you a guarded stare.##npc$$1$#|
5878|#&7$Jules##br#
"The fire in your eyes brings back memories, young one. When Watson, Elaine and I were your age, we carried that same intensity. We are older now, but not so useless. Perhaps one day you could be interested in joining us."#br##br#
#&53$Jules smiles with a warm blend of admiration and nostalgia.##npc$$824$1#|
5879|#&7$Elaine##br#
"Watson, Jules and I have been friends since we were young. You'd think Watson would learn from age and experience, but he is just as impulsive as ever. Watson is the perfect example for the phrase, 'Crazy after all these years.'"#br##br#
#&53$Elaine chuckles softly, though there is exasperation in her smile.##npc$$828$1#|
5880|#&7$Andre##br#
"Reinhardt... " #npc$$827$1#|
5881|Why did Trolls capture the princess and her group?|
5882|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Because... Well, I suppose the Trolls mistook them for radishes..."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
5883|#&7$Eddie##br#
"Even someone as amazing as I, Crystal Shadow Demon Hunter Eddie, Great Exorcist Eddie, needs a rest from time to time."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
5884|What is the power of the Eidolons?|
5885|#&7$%n%##br#
Legend claims that there is a certain crystal containing the power of the Eidolons. If such a power can be released, there is a chance to summon a powerful Eidolon. #char$$1$0#|
5886|How can I obtain the power of the Eidolons?|
5887|#&7$%n%##br#
The power of the Eidolons is spread throughout the world. It is next to impossible for an ordinary person to gather enough of it together to summon an Eidolon. Only an Envoy of Gaia can successfully gather together enough power to summon an Eidolon. #char$$1$0#|

5894|Present to Penny your obedient Young Sarpa.|
5895|#&7$Penny##br#
"Wow! I admit, I didn't think you'd really return with a Sarpa infant! And so soon... Now I can actually continue my research on the ecology of the Sarpa. This is great! Hopefully I can iron out the wrinkles of their evolutionary process."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
#&53$Penny carefully and gently examines the young Sarpa.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"How strange. This Young Sarpa seems to be quite normal. I'll have to perform tests, of course, but so far there aren't any outer signs as to how exactly the Sarpa are evolving. Perhaps the changes are happening due to their environment..."#br##br#
#&53$Penny lowers her head and murmurs to herself as she continues her meticulous examination.##npc$$828$1#|
5896|#&7$Kasim##br#
"Camilla is such a sweet, wonderful girl..."#npc$$821$1#|
5897|Give Penny some Spring Water.|
5898|#&7$Penny##br#
"Ah, that must be the spring water from the Sarpa Abyss! Allow me to use this."#npc$$821$1#|
5899|#&7$Natasha##br#
"Man, that hits the spot. I have such a sweet tooth."#npc$$821$1#|
5900|#&7$Village Chef##br#
"There's a certain mushroom that grows southwest of Candeo Marsh. They're quite bright in color, with a shape unique from normal mushrooms. Yes, that means they're very poisonous."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Village Chef##br#
"However, my master chef and I have been exchanging ideas. After many discussions, we may have come up with an ingredient that can neutralize the poison of the mushrooms, turning them into an edible and delicious dish."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Village Chef##br#
"After hearing this news, how can you resist the urge to want to sink your teeth into this? But, as if this obstacle wasn't enough, this certain mushroom also goes bad a couple of days after being picked, so they are impossible to store. I'll need to cook this on the spot."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Village Chef##br#
"If you want to try some, you can go to the southwest of Candeo Marsh to look for them. Five mushrooms should do it. As soon as you return, we shall work out talents in the kitchen!"#br##br#
#&53$The Village Chef grins, confident and eager.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Village Chef##br#
"Oh yes, almost forgot: never eat them raw! Once, some idiot, boasting about trying all the bizarre foods of the world, threw up for a whole week after eating one of those mushrooms raw."#npc$$821$1#|
5901|Your mouth waters in anticipation for the delicious meal as you hand over the mushrooms.|
5902|#&7$Village Chef##br#
"Hmm... great shape, smooth texture, bright color... I can do something with these mushrooms."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$With a flourish, the Village Chef sautees the mushrooms.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Village Chef##br#
"Finished! The flavorful aroma and bright colors makes this dish absolutely mouth-watering. Try some."#br##br#
#&53$The Village Chef proudly passes you a plate of the brightly-colored mushrooms.##npc$$821$1#|
5903|#&7$Village Chef##br#
"It's a start, but there's not enough mushrooms here for a meal. I need five Mushrooms per one serving of the dish. You'll find plenty southwest of the marsh."|
5904|#&7$Sterling##br#
"Frankly, living here beats living in any dirty, crowded town any day of the week."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"Aside from the obvious benefits, living here can be quite boring. Yeah, I can admit that. But I'd rather be bored than pestered all day. Maybe if I kept a pet or two, days here will pass at a more bearable pace."#npc$$821$1#|
5905|You introduce the Young Turtles to Sterling.|
5906|#&7$Sterling##br#
"Eh, I think I can keep myself busy enough, with all these turtles about."#npc$$821$1#|
5907|#&7$Sterling##br#
"A benefit of living alone is that I remember every little thing I say. I clearly remember asking for four turtles, but I don't see four. One turtle is fine, but my upcoming birthday party will be better celebrated with four."#npc$$821$1#|
5908|Show Sterling the Old Sword.|
5909|#&7$Sterling##br#
"I thought I got rid of this sword for good. Where did you manage to dig it up?"#br##br#
#&53$Sterling looks astonished as he examines the sword.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You repeat what Merrill said about the sword.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"In times past, Merrill was the swordsmith I always went to for repairs. He's still just as good as he was back then. He needs to be like the swords he mends, never allowing himself to fade away."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"I'm fine living this way; I will never use this sword again. Still, thank you for finding it, if only for the memories it brings. I'll take Merrill's words under consideration."#npc$$822$1#|
5910|#&7$Macallan##br#
"I wasted my vacation time! There is absolutely nothing to do in this stinkin' desert!"#npc$$821$1#|
5911|#&7$Charlie##br#
"It's been my dream to communicate with the majestic unicorns. It's why I became a researcher, after all. Right now they have been contaminated; they're at risk of going extinct! Unless we come up with a solution soon, my dream will stay only that."#npc$$821$1#|
5912|Charlie needs help rescuing the Unicorns.|
5913|#&7$Charlie##br#
"The Unicorns southeast of Fernscall Cottage originally held such grace, such spirituality unmatched by any other animal. These calm and tranquil creatures have become cruel and violent due to the contamination."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Charlie##br#
"I've created a special antibody designed to help these unicorns resistant the disease. I just...well, I don't have the time to properly test it. I...I have no idea how well it'll work, if it'll work at all, and what the side-effects might be."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Charlie##br#
"I would like to treat the Unicorns myself, but I just can't get close enough! They're so fierce and, admittedly, I'm too afraid of injury..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Charlie##br#
"Regardless of how I feel, though, the contamination keeps getting worse. We just can't wait and hope things turn around for the better; we need to do something! Could you please take this antibody to the Unicorns and try it on them? If the medicine looks like it's working on any of them, bring them back here."#npc$$822$1#|
5914|#&7$Charlie##br#
"There's no time to waste! Use the antibody to save the unicorns! If the antibody doesn't work on some Unicorns, use it on others."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Charlie##br#
"These particular Unicorns are located southeast of the Fernscall Cottage. Cross the bridge and turn left, they're hard to miss. These unicorns can be very dangerous, so please be careful."#npc$$821$1#|
5915|Help Sterling.|
5916|#&7$Sterling##br#
"Life here is more or less perfect, but I do get bored from time to time being by myself. Having a few pets would definitely liven up the long hours."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"What kind of pets? Hmm... well, something I can train from a young age would be ideal. Easier to tame, easier to train, easier to care for and all that... And, hopefully, they'll be less aggressive, too. No sense in spending so much time with a critter only to have it abandon ya."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"Hmm... most of the animals here are kind of...hostile. Hmm... Ah! I know! The Turtles at Fernscall Woods would be perfect!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"Between their slower lifestyles and their long life spans, they'd make great companions for an old soul like me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"Alright, time for action! Hmm, this feed here should do the trick. Use it to attract some young turtles in Fernscall woods. Snagging more than one will be ideal; it will help me stay busy!"#npc$$822$1#|
5917|#&7$Slick##br#
"Demons don't exist! So dumb... If they did exist, I'd totally send them crying back to their mommas! If you go southwest of the marsh and fetch me some mud, I'll show you how to get rid of a demon."#npc$$821$1#|
5918|Hand the mud over to Slick.|
5919|#&7$Slick##br#
"That was fast! But I guess there's mud everywhere around here... Anyway, should Demons exist, this is the technique to get rid of 'em."#npc$$821$1#|
5920|#&7$Slick##br#
"I can't even get rid of frogs with so little mud, much less demons! How about you go get some more."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Slick##br#
"The mud south of Candetonn is perfect. Get me at least four good handfuls!"#npc$$824$1#|
5921|#&7$Merrill##br#
"Fewer and fewer caravans come passing through here lately. It's gonna kill my business."#npc$$821$1#|
5922|It seems I've found a rusty sword.|
5923|#&7$Merrill##br#
"This sword looks bad, but it's only surface damage. Its structure and balance is still good; it just needs a good polish.#npc$$821$1#

#&53$Merrill repairs the rusty sword.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Merrill##br#
"Here we are, good as new! If I'm not mistaken, this is Sterling's sword. I've repaired it enough times to know. Never thought he'd sink it into the marsh."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Merrill##br#
"Sterling was once this village's best warrior, and he knew it. However, one day, during a battle, he got too cocky. He lost a close friend due to his carelessness. After that, he just...slowly wasted away, becoming a shell of his former self. Eventually, he decided to live alone in the marsh."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Merrill##br#
"How about this: I'll give this sword back to you. If you run across Sterling again, give it to him. Perhaps seeing his favorite weapon will lift his spirits and remind him of how great he once was. It's unhealthy for anyone to be so isolated out there in the marsh."#npc$$828$1#|
5924|#&7$Ace##br#
"I've learned about this area from an old treasure map. However, after all the time it took to get here, it's nothing but a small mound. The treasure must be buried under that mound."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ace##br#
"I was so excited to get here, I forgot the most obvious thing - a tool to dig the treasure up with. I should have grabbed the shovel from the tool box in Candetonn. But if I leave now, someone else might come along and take the treasure before I get back."#npc$$821$1#|
5925|Ah, he's still here. Give Ace the Shovel.|
5926|Give Marty the Cactus Fruit.|
5927|#&7$Sterling##br#
"The Young Turtles live in the northern Fernscall Woods. Go ahead and feed them this food. They'll fall asleep to make it easier for you to bring them back here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sterling##br#
"Bring back at least five turtles. I think that's a good number. It'll keep things busy around here, but not too noisy."#npc$$822$1#|
5928|#&7$Luke##br#
"My girlfriend and I have been together for a long time. I'm finally ready to ask her to marry me, but according to village tradition, the one making the proposal must get a Marriage Flower from the marsh."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luke##br#
Marriage Flowers are red and beautiful, but they're rare. Because getting one is difficult, it represents a true and sincere heart. Things outside the village have been abnormally dangerous lately. I understand that getting the flower is supposed to be difficult, but now it is next to impossible."#npc$$828$1#|
5929|These Marriage Flowers are certainly nice. You hand them over to Luke.|
5930|#&7$Luke##br#
"Wow...you actually found them! I-I...well...thank you! I'm gonna go get ready so I can propose to Nina!"#npc$$821$1#|
5931|#&7$Luke##br#
"I want to propose to my girlfriend, but in this town, when a man proposes, he must do so with a bouquet of flowers of at least three colors."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luke##br#
"The marsh has become very dangerous. I've tried many times to get the flowers, but I can't get close enough to the marsh to do so. How can I propose if I can't even pick flowers?"#npc$$821$1#|
5932|#&7$Kurt##br#
"Such a long way to go to the next town. I...I doubt I can get there safely...what am I going to do?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kurt##br#
"O-oh! Adventurer! Hero! You look strong and energetic! I'm about to collapse! Could you help me deliver these goods?"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Kurt##br#
"I've been attacked so many times by monsters on this road. The last time I was attacked, I was forced to leave behind most of my goods. Now there are more monsters in this area than the rest of the road combined! I'm so worried that I'll die here."#npc$$829$1#|
5933|No worries! These monsters are nothing to me; I can definitely escort you to the village.|
5934|#&7$Kurt##br#
"If not for you, I would have never made it through the marsh!"#npc$$821$1#|
5935|#&7$Coolidge##br#
"The Makar rule this prairie, and among them, the talented hunters. Only the strongest are recognized for their skill and talent."#npc$$821$1#|
5936|I want to prove my worth!|
5937|#&7$Coolidge##br#
"Among the Makar, the only way to prove your worth as a warrior is through the hunt. If you can obtain Rhino Horns, you'll be accepted among the Makar."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Coolidge##br#
"From what I can tell, your fighting prowess is good enough for the job. If you want to make the attempt, place this Decoy under that big tree over there. Rhinos will be unable to resist it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Coolidge##br#
"While your target is distracted, ambush it for its horn. Bring 'em back here as proof of your efforts."#npc$$821$1#|
5938|#&7$Coolidge##br#
"Is this task already too difficult for you? Take this Decoy into the prairie and hunt down a rhino."#npc$$821$1#|
5939|#&7$Madeira##br#
"The Gnomes have started to cause trouble. They need to be reminded of who dominates this prairie."#npc$$821$1#|
5940|The Gnomes need to know who the true leader is. You decide to help Madeira.|
5941|#&7$Madeira##br#
"Take this totem to the Gnomes. Plant it at the main entrance of their village. Our people will be reminded that the gnomes don't rule over them. Their morale will certainly soar."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeira##br#
"Those Gnomes will undoubtedly try to destroy the totem, so you must protect it at all costs. Never allow the totem to fall!"#npc$$821$1#|
5942|#&7$Madeira##br#
"Do not be scared of the Gnomes! Take the totem I gave you to their village."#npc$$821$1#|
5943|#&7$Raki##br#
"To be closer to Gaia, I've abandoned my tribe to live alone on the Prairie. After so long, I'm finally beginning to feel that spiritual connection."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Raki##br#
"The only reason any of us are able to survive and thrive on this land is because of The Blessing of Sprites. So you should always be thankful to Gaia."#npc$$821$1#|
5944|I would like to thrive here, too. How do I receive the Blessing of Sprites?|
5945|#&7$Raki##br#
"You may not be Makar by blood, but if you diligently worship our ancestors, you will be blessed just like one of us." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Raki##br#
There. I've placed a spell on you. Now, visit the three ancestral totems on the prairie and pray with all your heart and soul. Only then will you gain the Blessing of Sprites. The totems in question are the Hoofbeast Totem, the Wolf Totem and the Rhino Totem. You will find them on the northern, western and eastern parts of the prairie. Search the habitats of the animals the totems are named after and you will find the totems themselves."#npc$$821$1#|
5946|#&7$Raki##br#
"The blessing spell I've cast on you still lingers. Now you must visit the three ancestral totems, praying to each one to gain the Blessing of Sprites."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Raki##br#
"These three totems are the Hoofbeast Totem the Wolf Totem and the Rhino Totem. They are located on the northern, western and eastern parts of the prairie. Search in the habitats of the animals in which the totems are named and you will find the totems."#npc$$821$1#|
5947|#&7$Mosley##br#
"Jerboas on their own are nothing to worry about. But when they work together to steal food, they become a serious problem."#npc$$821$1#|
5948|Stealing food isn't good. I should probably help Mosley.|
5949|#&7$Mosley##br#
"I've been seeing more Jerboas lately. Their food source has become scarce, so they've been sneaking into the village to steal food. This has been creating problems."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mosley##br#
"I need help catching these vermin. So many of them have been stealing the food. If you have a moment, I would appreciate your assistance."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mosley##br#
"Here are some bags. Catch at least four of the pests and bring them back here. I'll take care of the rest."#npc$$821$1#|

"Thieving Jerboas like to hide among the tribespeople. Catch them before they take more food."#npc$$821$1#|
5951|These critters are fast, and they're putting up quite a fight in this bag, but here they are!|
5952|#&7$Mosley##br#
"I didn't know there were this many of them! It must have been quite a task for you; thank you! Look at these creatures, fat from our food. We won't have a food storage problem for a while now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mosley##br#
#&53$Mosley stuffs the Jerboas in a cage, looking quite excited...and famished.##npc$$1$1#

"As thanks for your help, here's my secret kebab recipe. They are sincerely the best kebabs on the prairie."#npc$$821$1#|
5953|#&7$Munroe##br#
"Gnomes are always trying to concoct the perfect cure-all medicine, but most of the time they come up with absolute garbage. Every so often, however, they'll surprise me with a decent healing potion."#npc$$821$1#|
5954|You give Munroe a bottle of that Gnomish healing potion he mentioned.|
5955|#&7$Munroe##br#
"This? Oh, this is something different... I've never seen the likes of this before. I'm going to have to run some tests." #npc$$821$1#|
5956|#&7$Nico##br#
"Dash it all, where is my Braided Rope?! Oh, no no no! If she finds out I've lost it, I'm so dead!"#npc$$821$1#|
5957|Give Nico the Braided Rope he's been desperately looking for.|
5958|#&7$Nico##br#
"Y-yes, that's precisely it! My rope! What are you doing with it? Give it back, now!"#npc$$821$1#|
5959|#&7$Ahketa##br#
"Lately, more and more of my tribesmen have been walking around with trimmed manes. How absolutely awful for them! I don't know if they've done it to themselves, but a Makar with a short mane is considered pathetic. I have to find a way to help those poor souls!"#npc$$821$1#|
5960|To be considered pathetic is terrible! You decide to help Ahketa.|
5961|#&7$Ahketa##br#
"Too many of my tribesmen have those hideous trimmed manes. How can I walk proudly in my own village with that surrounding me? But that's alright. I have a solution."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ahketa##br#
"Shaggy Hoofbeasts have these long, silky manes, absolutely gorgeous. Their hair will make a great replacement for my unfortunate tribesmen's manes! Here, take these scissors with you. Bring back some of that fantastic hair from Shaggy Hoofbeasts."#npc$$821$1#|
5962|#&7$Ahketa##br#
"Shaggy Hoofbeasts graze to the east of the tribe. It would be fantastic of you to bring me a bit of their hair."#npc$$821$1#|
5963|Here's the Shaggy Hoofbeast hair you asked for.|
5964|#&7$Ahketa##br#
"Wow! The quality of this hair is better than I anticipated! Perhaps I can style these manes in different ways... Yes! Brilliant! Not only will I be helping my tribe, but I may start a new fashion trend! My manes will be all the rage..."#npc$$821$1#|
5965|#&7$Mateja##br#
"Enough is enough! I have had it with these Gnomes! Something really needs to be done about them!"#npc$$821$1#|
5966|Perhaps I could be of assistance?|
5967|#&7$Mateja##br#
"Nothing scares Gnomes out of their wits better than rampaging Rhinos. I bet if we light the tips of their tales on fire, it will cause an even bigger ruckus."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mateja##br#
"Here's a torch and a rope. Lasso a Rhino with the rope, then lead it to the Gnomes' camp. Light the tip of its tail on fire and watch those Gnomes scatter!"#npc$$821$1#|
5968|#&7$Mateja##br#
"Torch, rope, you're all set! So, round up a Rhino and stir up some chaos with the Gnomes." #npc$$821$1#|
5969|#&7$Mino##br#
"The Rebel Army needs to know what we do to betrayers."#npc$$821$1#|
5970|Tell me what to do!|
5971|#&7$Mino##br#
"Ferocious Wolves and Bloodthirsty Wolves are preventing us from attacking the Rebel Army! Irritating! But perhaps they can be of some use to us... Their flesh, bones and skins could help us survive out here while we figure out how to deal with the Rebel Army."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mino##br#
"Even capturing just one of those wolves and bringing it back here will give us plenty of food and materials for an edge against the Rebel Army. What a great idea!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Mino##br#
"Take this Bag and Special Meatloaf, but don't eat the meatloaf! It'll put you to sleep. Someone like you is skilled and quick enough to get one of those wolves to eat the meat. Then just stuff it in the bag and bring it here."#npc$$822$1#|
5972|#&7$Mino##br#
"With the laced meat and a bag to put a wolf in, you should have no problems bringing one to me."#npc$$821$1#|
5973|Talk about a nuisance! But I did what you asked; I've got a wolf with me.|
5974|#&7$Mino##br#
"Excellent! This wolf looks like it'll be able to sustain us for a while. I'll put it in a cage right away."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mino##br#
"Oh, others are starting to do the same thing! Already I'm noticing less wolves between us and the Rebel Army camp. Soon we'll be able to strike."#npc$$824$1#|
5975|Carroll seems really worried. I'll help rescue the captive.|
5976|#&7$Carroll##br#
"One of my colleagues has been captured by the rebels, and now is under strict guard at their camp! The General controls everything the Guards do, so rescuing him will be difficult."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Carroll##br#
"I've been watching the camp for a while to find an opportunity. The guards always release their captives when the general interrogates them. If someone can be disguised as one of the guards, we'll have that small window to rescue him."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Carroll##br#
"I already tried it, but was found out. I can't do it again; they'll know who I am instantly. I'm hoping you can go for me. Don't worry - I'll help with your Rebel disguise. You'll fit right in." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Carroll##br#
#&53$Carroll takes the time to dress you like a Rebel Army Guard.##M009050$%n%$1$0#

#&7$Carroll##br#
"You're kinda swimming in the disguise, but I don't think you'll be discovered. Remember, the Guard only does what the General tells them to do. So, it's probably best if you get orders from him before you try to pull the wool over his eyes. Be careful when going into the Camp. Good luck!" #npc$$821$1#|
5977|#&7$Carroll##br#
"The general's braided rope is key. Without it, even the most foolish member of the Rebel Army will know you are an imposter."#npc$$821$1#|
5978|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Young Sarpa pins you with an expectant look, hopeful for food.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$What do Sarpa eat anyway? It doesn't seem to want any of the food you have on you. Guess this won't work; you'll have to leave empty-handed.##char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Just as you turn to leave, a sharp pain in your head pierces your thoughts. From within your mind you hear fragmented words:##br##br#
"Waterweed...Sarpa Abyss...Delicious...Waterweed...Hungry..." #char$$501$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Stricken, you turn your head to stare wide-eyed at the Young Sarpa. It meets your stare with its own, that same intensity of expectation. Apparently, it still thinks you can provide it food.##char$$1$0#|
5979|Meet the Young Sarpa's hopes; feed it some Waterweed.|
5980|#&7$Young Sarpa##br#
#&53$The Young Sarpa gobbles down the Waterweed, then contently follows you, hoping for more food.##npc$$821$1#|
5981|#&7$Young Turtle##br#
#&53$The Young Turtle shows no indication that it is about to move.##npc$$821$1#|
5982|Hmm. Well, maybe food will make it move. Go ahead and feed the Young Turtle.|
5983|#&7$Young Turtle##br#
#&53$Satisfied with its meal, the Young Turtle drifts to sleep.##npc$$821$1#|
5984|#&7$Rebel Army Ranger##br#
"No one leaves here without me noticing. No one! U-unless, of course, the General himself comes, or I'm ordered to do something else. But that's beside the point! I will ensure that these prisoners rot in their cages! Do you need something? Unless the General has ordered it, there's nothing I can do, so I suggest you go bug someone else." #npc$$821$1#|
5985|By the general's orders, I am delivering this prisoner.|
5986|#&7$Rebel Army Ranger##br#
"Oh? Another sorry wretch for the General to interrogate. Take him away quickly; can't leave the General waiting. Don't let the captive escape, or it's your head."#npc$$821$1#|
5987|#&7$Rebel Army Ranger##br#
"Wait a second, wait a second... your clothes...your step...hey, you're not one of us!! You're dead if you think I'll let this prisoner go while I'm still breathing! Save your own skin and get out of here or I'll kill you where you stand!" #npc$$821$1#|
5988|You speak of all the problems you've encountered.|
5989|#&7$Ali##br#
"So, here's the situation: Iron Armordillos lay their eggs this time of year. We keep 3 female Iron Armordillos in this park; none of them have ever had issues laying eggs in the past. This year, it's different..." #br##br#
#&53$Ali appears worried, his voice strained. ##M039010$Ali$828$1#

#&7$Tilde##br#
"Iron Armordillos typically lay their eggs in warm, sunny areas. I don't know if it's an environmental change that's doing it, or something wrong with the food, but this year, they've laid their eggs in a dark, damp cave."#M038010$Tilde$821$1#

#&7$Ali##br#
"This is quite a problem. without enough sunlight, the Iron Armordillo babies will never hatch from their eggs."#M039010$Ali$821$1#

#&7$Tilde##br#
"Here's where the situation gets worse: Iron Armordillos are very protective of their eggs. Very. If anyone tries to move the eggs, the Iron Armordillo will attack!"#M038010$Tilde$828$1#

#&7$Ali##br#
"If the Iron Armordillos won't allow us to move their eggs, their babies will die before they're hatched. If we can just figure out how to get those eggs out of there..."#br##br#
#&53$Ali balls his hands into fists; he is clearly frustrated. ##M039010$Ali$828$1#|
5990|I want to help. Tell me what to do.|
5991|#&7$Ali##br#
"If you can sneak those Iron Armordillo eggs out of the cave and hand them to Tilde our crisis is resolved."#br##br#
#&53$Ali's tone lightens. He unclenches his fists, pacing in subdued excitement. ##M039010$Ali$824$1#

#&7$Ali##br#
"There's one very important thing you have to remember, though. Female Iron Armordillos have an amazing sense of smell. If any of them detect that you are near her clutch, you'll have to get out of there quickly and wait until she's calm to try again."#br##br#
#&53$Ali holds his gaze to yours, his tone serious.##M039010$Ali$821$1#

#&7$Ali##br#
"Probably not a bad idea for you to talk to Tilde to get more info on these armordillos before you go. She's right here, next to me. She's an expert; she'll answer any of your questions."#M039010$Ali$822$1#|
5992|Inquire about the behavior of Iron Armordillos.|
5993|#&7$Tilde##br#
"Healthy, mature female Iron Armordillos lay one egg each year, building a nest in sunlight."#M038010$Tilde$821$1#

#&7$Tilde##br#
"They're very aggressively when it comes to protecting their young. Anyone near their nest will be attacked."#M038010$Tilde$821$1#

#&7$Tilde##br#
"As such, they're more alert than usual. You'll need to be very cautious!"#M038010$Tilde$821$1#|
5994|Carefully pass over an Armordillo Egg.|
5995|#&7$Tilde##br#
"Oh no, were you not able to get close enough to a nest to grab an egg? I don't know what we'll do if you decide to change your mind about helping us."#br##br#
#&53$Tilde wrings her hands in worry.##M038010$Tilde$821$1#

#&7$Reggie##br#
"I have Thieving Dragons sneaking around the park. While the park was being relocated, and everything was in a chaos, that was the time when those annoying pests decided to escape from their cages. They continuously nibble on the park's feed behind my back."#M039040$Reggie$821$1#

#&7$Reggie##br#
"Because these Thieving Dragons are the park's property, I'm only allowed to capture them, but with how angry they've made me, I feel like doing worse. Every day the park hounds me to capture these tricksters, but you think I can actually do it? No! I've tried everything! I can't lose my job. I'm at my wit's end!"#br##br#
#&53$Reggie groans in despair, worried and angry at once.##M039040$Reggie$827$1#|
5998|#&7$Reggie##br#
"Thieving Dragons are greedy. Only a little feed draws them out of hiding."#M039040$Reggie$821$1#

#&7$Reggie##br#
"What makes the situation aggravating is that they move very fast. They swallow the feed and disappear again in the blink of an eye, so I miss catching them each and every time."#br##br#
#&53$Reggie's rage simmers to reluctant resignation; he seems tired of fighting this situation.##M039040$Reggie$828$1#

#&7$Reggie##br#
Despite all this, they do have a weakness. They're deathly afraid of water. It sounds easier than it actually is, but all you need to do is trap them in the pool behind me." #M039040$Reggie$821$1#

#&7$Reggie##br#
"If you can manage to do the impossible, capture five of those Thieving Dragons... Anyway, let me know when you're ready."#br##br#
#&53$Reggie stares at you with hope.##M039040$Reggie$822$1#|
5999|I'm ready to catch some Thieving Dragons! Give me some feed.|

"Here's the feed needed to draw out those Thieving Dragons. I've marked the spots where they were most frequently spotted. Just set the feed at those spots."#M039040$Reggie$821$1#

#&7$Reggie##br#
"Stay alert! Those Thieving Dragons will flee the second they finish, so react quickly to knock them out!"#br##br#
#&53$Reggie nods, his expression tense.##M039040$Reggie$828$1#|
6001|Capture the Thieving Dragon.|
6002|#&7$Reggie##br#
"I was right, wasn't I? They're so fast and agile! Keep up the good work! I have faith that you'll catch all five of those Thieving Dragons very soon!"#br##br#

"Grawrgggg!"#M026021h+90$Koor$2012$1#

#&53$Koor lets loose a terrible roar that sounds like a dying peacock. It isn't exactly adorable.##char$$821:75$0#

#&7$Donna##br#
"It's just too sad that Koor is an orphan. When we first discovered it in the wild, it was so weak and lonely that it couldn't even make a peep."#M038020$Donna$829$1#

#&7$Donna##br#
"The park director accepted Koor with open arms. It was brought back to the park for immediate care, but unfortunately, we have a bit of a problem now."#M038020$Donna$821$1#

#&7$Donna##br#
"Since Koor has never been with its own kind, it never acquired the skills to survive in the wild. Someone must help it, or it will surely die!"#br##br#
#&53$Donna looks up at you, worry in her eyes.##M038020$Donna$821$1#|
6005|#&7$Donna##br#
"I've designed a series of courses to help Koor learn to survive in the wild,"#br##br#
#&53$Donna explains.##M038020$Donna$821$1#

#&7$Donna##br#
"Just follow my instructions, and Koor will be just fine."#br##br#

"Of course, it's not foolproof. There are still risks."#M038020$Donna$821$1#

"It's not easy running such a huge park. Doctor Crow's extraordinary understanding of how this park functions inspires the rest of us to do our very best for this place."#br##br#

6010|#&7$Donna##br#
"It is my dream to live and work with wild animals. I may be an exhausted wreck sometimes, but it's worth it! I get this overwhelming sense of pride whenever we rehabilitate an animal back into the wild."#br##br#

6018|What kind of plant is an Evil Dream Eater?|
6019|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"You're asking about Evil Dream Eaters, yes? They are a mutated type of plant that can steal the dreams of others as their food. Once they take your mind candy, you'll be plagued by nightmares, the power of those nightmares manifesting into horrible reality." #npcs70h+85$$825$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Once the Evil Dream Eaters are fueled by nightmares, they'll start to attack people in their dreams which creates more nightmares, empowering the monsters endlessly." #npc$$825$1#|
6020|What is a nightmare monster?|
6021|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"A nightmare is a different type of monster. It only exists in dreams, and it absorbs the dreamers' life through said dreams. If the person becomes upset or angry during a dream, the power of nightmares grows stronger."#npcs70h+85$$825$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"The best way to get rid of nightmares is to make the world a more peaceful and joyful place, thus eliminating nightmare fuel in everyday life and sending people to bed happy."#npc$$825$1#

6181|What's the story of the Sky Tower?|
6182|#&7$Barry##br#
"This tower is a combined product of magic and mechanics. It was built during the era of the first Grand Bishop. It used to be chock full of various grimoires, armor, and weaponry."#M109010$Barry$825$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"At 100 floors, the Sky Tower reaches into the clouds. Its higher floors contain older and stronger holy relics."#M109010$Barry$821$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"To prevent anyone from stealing them, the Grand Bishop asked some of the best mages of that time to cast strong magic barriers to shield the tower. Only the current Grand Bishop knows the password to remove them."#M109010$Barry$821$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"The tower is also imbued with a unique magical energy. This energy creates phantoms of various ancient creatures to protect the relics in the tower."#M109010$Barry$1$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"The most famous relic can heal every disease imaginable. Legend has it that it is located on top of the tower, and its strongest beast watches over it."#M109010$Barry$825$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"I've also heard that the tower stretches into another dimension, but there's no way to prove that."#M109010$Barry$828$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"All of the relics tucked away in this tower serve as a collective record of the world's history. It can be quite overwhelming, to say the least."#M109010$Barry$821$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"...And the creatures inside are fiercely protective of the tower. As well they should be!"#M109010$Barry$827$1#|
6183|What are the requirements for entering the Sky Tower?|
6184|#&7$Barry##br#
"This tower hasn't been open to anyone for almost 100 years. An entire military investigation team was exterminated by the creatures inside, and the tower has been shut ever since."#M109010$Barry$828$1#

#&7$Barry##br#
"If the Grand Bishop decides to open the tower, anyone who sets foot inside will need to be prepared. In my opinion, some of the evil things brewing in the world today are no more dangerous than the creatures dwelling within the tower."#M109010$Barry$821$1#

"What do you want to know?#br#
"I do work in the Magic department now, but I only specialize in Zombies."#

#&7$Horace##br#
"We fear Envoys of Gaia may just turn into Zombies if they cannot control their intense Power of Gaia.#br#
However, not all Zombies are cut from the same cloth, so it gets rather complicated.#br#
Generally speaking, there are five categories of Zombies."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"We call 'em the Excluded, Disintegrated, Mutated, Commanding and Peculiar types."#npc$$825$1#|
6201|About "Excluded" Zombies|
6202|#&7$Horace##br#
"Sometimes, an Envoy of Gaia is awakened but fails to bond with an Eidolon. We call these Zombies 'Excluded Type'#."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"According to recent statistics, about 70% of Envoys of Gaia become this manner of Zombie."#

#&7$Horace##br#
"Luckily, compared to other types, Excluded Zombies are typically physically weaker. Those trained for battle can easily best these brain-eaters."#npc$$821$1#|
6203|About "Disintegrated" Zombies|
6204|#&7$Horace##br#
"When Envoys of Gaia control an unusually strong Eidolon, it sometimes causes their mind to crumble from within. We call them the #&15$'Disintegrated Type'#."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"We come across a lot of cases like this. The Envoys lose their minds over time."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"If they can endure a slow descent into madness, doesn't it stand to reason that they're pretty darn powerful?"#npc$$821$1#|
6205|About "Mutated" Zombies|
6206|#&7$Horace##br#
"Sometimes, when an Envoy of Gaia is imbued with a huge amount of energy within a short period of time, it causes the Eidolon to grow incredibly strong. In the end, the Eidolon takes over the Envoy. They then become the #&52$'Mutated Type'#."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"Usually, this only happens to the most ambitious Envoys of Gaia."#br##br#
#&53$Horace raised an eyebrow at you, suspicious.##npc$$829$1#|
6207|About "Commanding" Zombies|
6208|#&7$Horace##br#
"Normally, Zombies lose all sense of reason almost immediately. However, some Zombies maintain the ability for rational thought. Not only that, but they can control other Zombies, too."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"We have no idea if such an ability comes from the original Envoy of Gaia or the Eidolon. It could even come from a totally new creature altogether."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"We call these Zombies the #&15$'Commanding Type'#."#npc$$825$1#|
6209|About "Peculiar" Zombies|
6210|#&7$Horace##br#
"Though most Zombies fit in one of the other categories, there are a few that can't really be placed. We call them the #&17$'Peculiar Type'#."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Horace##br#
"We're researching these moldy creatures feverishly, trying to learn all we can. Hopefully, we'll make some breakthroughs soon."#npc$$824$1#|
6211|#&7$Richie##br#
"My teacher is head researcher in the study of Zombies. His course has become mandatory study for the Magic Department."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Richie##br#
"If you have questions, ask my teacher. Since you might just become a zombie yourself, it's probably best if you know everything there is to know about them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Richie##br#
"Generally speaking, though, we don't release too much specific information about Zombies to the public. We don't want to cause a panic."#npc$$823$1#|

"Richie, have you heard about Maggie's situation?"#npc$$821$1#

"Most property transactions go through me before being announced. However, the bill hasn't been passed; opinions vary too much among the parliament members, so no decision has been reached."#M116030$Tommy$821$1#

#&7$Tommy##br#
"Prior to each sales meeting, there is a preparatory meeting. The parliament members can join them and elect a chairperson for each committee. A bill can go to the main meeting only after it passes the preparatory meeting discussion."#M116030$Tommy$821$1#

#&7$Tommy##br#

#&7$O'Leary##br#
"In recent years, the Church and the parliament have been trying to work the public's opinion into the government and make life better for citizens. They have jointly opened various ventures to improve residents' quality of life."#M123020$O'Leary$821$1#

#&7$O'Leary##br#
"If you're wondering when there will be orders from the Templars, you'll need to wait until the discussions are concluded. I'll let you know."#M123020$O'Leary$821$1#|

"There are always clots and clusters of monsters lurking around the Triatio Highlands. Many residents who go out to hunt them never come back. With this expedition, we're hoping to reduce unnecessary casualties as much as possible."#M121010$Shawn$821$1#

#&7$Shawn##br#
"Various monsters attacked our people, and thus, they have a wide variety of injuries, some more serious than others. Even though they're safe from beasts for now, there's a limit to what we can do. We don't have the resources to treat them all."#M121010$Shawn$821$1#|
6217|#&7$Katie##br#
"The monsters outside the village grow more vicious by the day! They're closing in on the villagers, gnashing their terrible teeth. It's a good thing we've decided to help, or they'd have done a lot more damage."#M123010$Katie$821$1#|

6231|How to Make Your Signature Drink|
6232|#&7$Cretia##br#
"The cuisine of a region encompasses everything special about that area. You can tell so much about local culture simply by looking at what people eat!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cretia##br#
"However, you can add your own special ingredients to local delicacies or use different methods to modify them and make them unique to you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cretia##br#
"Odd-looking Pepper Trees and Sweet Grasses grow in Windwhisper Meadow, and luscious Rainbow Fruit thrives in the Emeralden Mountains. These ingredients can really jazz up a dish. Bam! Adding them to a meal gives it a whole new taste. If you're interested, go seek out the tasty items."#npc$$821$1#|
6233|#&7$Ann##br#
"Crescent Hill is quite an amazing place. Unique ingredients flourish here, from candied lima beans to yams that are already stuffed with marshmallows. The best time to produce spices and ingredients is during the ceremony."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Ann##br#
"Nestled within the flower fields are Crescent Flowers. Use their buds to make savory and sweet spices. The ground of the forest is also teeming with small nests containing fresh bird eggs. Oh, and in the north of the ruins, you'll find almost every kind of nut you could ever dream up. Take a look around." #npc$$825$1#|
6234|#&7$Posey##br#
"The drinks here are already delicious, but if we add some special spices to them, we can come up with some new, craveable flavors. How does blueberry-butterscotch sound?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Posey##br#
"You can only find Crescent Flower nectar in the flower fields here. You can also get Patterned Grass near the Gnomes. Both of these ingredients are crucial if we want to concoct a tasty drink."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Posey##br#
"If you can find eggs in the Small Bird's Nests, you can make Jiggly Pudding. My mouth's watering just thinking about. It's rich in eggy goodness; you'll love it!"#npc$$821$1#|
6235|#&7$Alanna##br#
"Adding extra ingredients to known dishes always creates surprising new flavors."#npcs85h+70$$825$1#

#&7$Alanna##br#
"If you want to try your hand at playing chef, look for a patch of mushrooms near the water. The mushrooms there have a woodsy, savory taste that brings out the unique flavor in almost anything else. They're like miracle ingredients!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Alanna##br#
"I should also mention the berry clusters in the forest. If you extract all the water from them and dry them out, they taste much stronger. Use them to make the best dang cookies you've ever tasted, unless you've had my famous Whipplenutter Choco Supremes."#npc$$825$1#|
6236|#&7$Seppy##br#
"Creative foods should be paired with new and exciting drinks. If you are interested in cooking, you ought to come up with a tasty beverage, too."#npcs85+70$$824$1#

#&7$Seppy##br#
"Go to Cactakara Forest to look for Berry Bushes, Sour Fruit Trees, and Energizing Cabbage. Seriously, what's a delicious drink without a big ol' hunk of cabbage?? Think outside the box for once!"#npc$$824$1#|
6237|#&7$Randolph##br#
"As a foodie, I'm always on the lookout for new ingredients."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Randolph##br#
"I once heard that wonderful ingredients grow near the Demarech Pool. For example, you can find eggs in rare Nests of Twigs, Oasis Spices, and Demarech Fruit. I'd like to take a look myself, but I'm simply too busy reporting the newest food craze. Why don't you take a look?"#npc$$1$1#|
6238|#&7$Dwayne##br#
"If you want to concoct a beverage bursting with flavor, I suggest you get some Demarech Fruit from the trees around the Demarech Pool. You should also try to pick a few Demarech Flowers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dwayne##br#
"It's a pity that monsters continuously lurk near the Demarech Pool. Otherwise, I'd be gathering ingredients there every chance I get! Oh, but, um, you should give it a try; it's totally worth the risk. Just, you know, not to me."#npc$$1$1#|
6239|#&7$Kimmie##br#
"Your own dish? Well, they say that the Sand-vine Fruit growing plump on the Sand Vines hidden in the New Moon Hunting Grounds is incredibly juicy and delicious. I've never tried it, but I heard it's even delicious in a sandwich."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kimmie##br#
"You can go to the hunting grounds to seek out Sand Vines. They look like long, thin vines covered in thorns. Try not to get pricked while you're plucking off the succulent fruit."#npc$$821$1#|
6240|#&7$Dawn##br#
"Oh man, I was just thinking about a milk tea I drank once. So rich and creamy! It had crispy, sweet coconut inside - a delectable surprise!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Dawn##br#
"At the time, I asked my friend about the recipe. He said that the coconut flesh came from a coconut tree. The trees thrive in the New Moon Hunting Grounds. Go check it out!"#npc$$1$1#|
6241|#&7$Erik##br#
"Since you want to make your own food, why not try something totally unique? The Sweet Coconuts in the vine forest look wrinkled and dimpled, but their milk is the sweetest! Also, the heads of fresh garlic found in the Thousandwaters Marsh add a pungent note to any culinary masterpiece."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erik##br#
"If you want to start collecting ingredients, let me give you some advice. Keep your eyes open, and make sure you know how to identify different kinds of plants. You don't want to confuse tangy buckleberries with poisoned skumberries, now do you?"#npc$$1$1#|
6242|#&7$Elizabeth##br#
"You've come to the right place. I'm a coffee fiend and am always finding new ways to brew the drink of the Gods. However, we should probably start from the beginning."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elizabeth##br#
"There is a cocoa tree south of Candetonn. You can pick Cocoa Fruit from it and mix it with milk to create a fabulously frothy coffee drink. It'll wake you right up!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elizabeth##br#
"All this talk about coffee made me almost forget: Highland Buffalo Milk can be bought from Dawn of the Yabak Beverage Company. I buy it every single time I go there. It's got that rich flavor you just don't find anywhere else! Yum, gritty!"#npc$$821$1#|
6243|#&7$Kai##br#
"Did you know that there's a special ingredient called Wind Spice that grows in Ventos Prairie? It tastes refreshing, almost like a sprig of mint, and it really brings out the flavor and cuts the richness of meat."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kai##br#
"There should be a few Wind Spice Bushes outside the Leyline Arena. If you look carefully. they should be easy to spot. If your stomach's grumbling, give it a try!"#npc$$1$1#|
6244|#&7$Kronk##br#
"So you want to make your own drinks, too? Interesting! Well, let me give you a recipe."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Kronk##br#
"Several Grapevines thrive in the north of Ventos Prairie. They're quite sour if you eat them plain, but they make for excellent wine. You ought to try it!"#npc$$825$1#|
6245|#&7$Lizzy##br#
"Custom dishes? Only highly skilled chefs can make those. I once heard my master say that you can find wild bird eggs in the bird nests north of Oblitus Wood. They greatly enhance the flavor of Sweet and Sour Meatballs, but my master won't let me go. Apparently, I'm too young. Bah! I want meatballs!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Lizzy##br#
"If you make a new dish, could you share it with me? I'm just so tired of mac and cheese! I know, I know, it doesn't seem possible, but believe me, it is!"#npc$$1$1#|
6246|#&7$Summer##br#
"I know a way to make a special drink, but you need a lot of ingredients. A certain type of Wind Spice tree grows wild in the Forest of Thorns. Pick its leaves and mix them with Stardust Flowers, steep them for a good long time. Mix that concoction with Nepenthe Tea, and you'll have one fantastic brew."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Summer##br#
"As for the Stardust Flowers, I once heard my master say that the blooms are only found in Navea. It's a beautiful flower, crowned with scarlet petals. I've never seen one myself, to be honest. Can you pick one and tell me what it really looks like? When I get old enough, I'll pick one myself."#npc$$821$1#|
6247|#&7$Doyle##br#
"If you want to bake a treat that you can proudly call your own, try making Spiced Bread! Don't worry, it's so much better than your aunt's fruit cake... well, better than my aunt's fruit cake, anyway."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Doyle##br#
"If you want to give it a try, head to the Grapevine outside the Oasis to turn those grapes into delicious raisins. Wash them, then throw 'em right in the bread dough."#npc$$824$1#|
6248|#&7$Barney##br#
"Have you heard of Fruity Egg Nog? It's a luscious, foamy drink made of milk and egg. If you mix small bird eggs from bird nests on the Cactus Plateau with Highland Buffalo Milk, you can make the Egg Nog. Mmm... raw eggs! I don't care what anyone says; salmonella tastes amazing!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Barney##br#
"Ah, I almost forgot. If you want some Highland Buffalo Milk, you can buy it from Dawn of the Yabak Beverage Company. Apparently, her Highland Buffalo Milk holds the richest flavor."#npc$$824$1#|
6249|#&7$Rick##br#
"Navea's ingredients come from all over. The city is known for its variety of spices and produce. Its mushrooms and vanilla are prized among chefs; most can be found scattered near the Sky Tower."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rick##br#
"After you find the perfect ingredients, you can put them in current dishes to modify their flavors, thus creating your own specialties."#npc$$821$1#|
6250|#&7$Lois##br#
"Do you want to make a completely unique drink? You ought to try seasoning your favorite beverage with Navea Vanilla and gourmet aromatic spores from the Sky Tower. All the best drinks incorporate these ingredients. Nothing like a good, vanilla-y mushroom spore! Really clears out your sinuses.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lois##br#
"You ought to look for a Stardust Flower, too. It grows among other flowers in the city. You'll need it to make a Stardust Float, which you'll definitely want to try."#npc$$821$1#|

6252|#&7$Lizzy##br#
"Whoa. Is this your new dish? It smells like... like caramel and fairy dust and ground beef! I bet it tastes just as good!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lizzy##br#
#&53$Lizzy's eyes light up ravenously. You decide to give her a taste.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Lizzy##br#

"The Dimensional Mage doesn't see many adventurers, but their role is still so important..." #npc$$828$1#|
6258|#&7$Virginia##br#
"Dimensional Fissures criss-cross the landscape now. This is definitely not normal. We need to do something soon to stop this." #npc$$828$1#|
6259|#&7$Tacrine##br#
"I've never seen so many Dimensional Fissures at once! If we expect to survive this, everyone must work together to develop a plan." #npc$$828$1#|
6260|#&7$Nelanna##br#
"These Dimensional Fissures are being opened from another world... I've never seen this before; I wonder why this is happening..." #br##br#

"Oh, this is absolutely terrible! Are there no more Shaggy Hoofbeasts east of us with silky Manes? I simply cannot make a decent mane with this little hair! There are so many out there still walking around with short manes; the poor dears! I managed 3 batches so far, but I could use more." #npc$$821$1#|

6272|#&7$Eidolon Researcher##br#
"I saw Vayu here once. Such solemn grace! I'll never forget it. Since then, I've watched this area for an entire month, just to learn when and how Vayu appears."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Eidolon Researcher##br#
"Then I learned that the only reason Vayu appeared at all was because he was drawn to a brave individual with the power of the Eidolons. I don't have that. If I did, I wouldn't be waiting here like this. Only an Envoy of Gaia has such power, unfortunately."#npc$$828$1#

"Then I learned that the only reason Bahadur appeared at all was because he was drawn to a brave individual with the power of the Eidolons. I don't have that. If I did, I wouldn't be waiting here like this. Only an Envoy of Gaia has such power, unfortunately."#npc$$828$1#

6283|#&7$Stall Information##br#
In light of frequent trade in the city, please consider transporting and managing your goods in the special Stall Area. All merchants are allowed to legally setup stalls in the designated area to exhibit and sell their wares as long as they obey the laws. The Stall Manager is in charge of handling related duties. #npc$$821$1#|
6284|#&7$Curly##br#
"Hello! Welcome to the Stall area, so glad you could join us. Navea encourages entrepreneurship, which is why this area exists. This is a place for any merchant with a selling license to set up a temporary stall from which they can peddle their wares. As a special courtesy, any Envoy of Gaia who has reached Level 20 can set up a stall here. Do not hesitate to see me at any time should you have questions. I'm here to make your small business endeavor as smooth as possible." #npc$$821$1#|
6285|Setting Up A Stall|
6286|#&7$Curly##br#
"The Stall Setup function was established by the Church as a way to exchange goods. You can use this ability to easily set up your own stall and sell items to others." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Curly##br#
"You aren't allowed to move while setting up your stall, and you also won't be able to use communication channels or interfaces, with the exception of Chat. On the bright side, others are not allowed to attack you during this process. These guidelines are to ensure tidiness and safety within the area while others shop. Once you close your interface, the stall will also close." #npc$$821$1#|
6287|Description of the Stall Area|
6288|#&7$Curly##br#
"There is currently only one Stall Area in Navea . It is located near the fountain (700, 500). Any qualified merchant is able to set up their own temporary stall in that area." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Curly##br#
"Ah, please remember two important things: stalls can't be set up in non-designated areas, and Envoys of Gaia below Level 20 can't legally set up a stall. Imagine if stalls were set up everywhere - the city would look so cluttered, and how would you find anything?" #npc$$821$1#|
6289|#&7$Lunara##br#
"Hi, I'm Lunara! I can't believe I'm actually talking with a real live Envoy of Gaia!"#br##br#
#&53$Lunara can barely hold back her excitement.##npcs70h+99$$1020$1#|
6290|Um, right! Could you please tell me how to retrieve the Moonlight Rice Cake? (Important)|
6291|#&7$Lunara##br#
"Of course! This cavern is called the  Eclipse Rabbit Cave. As far as I know, they've hidden the stolen Rice Cakes in different corners of the cave. Eclipse Rabbits have placed enchantments where the Rice Cakes are to protect them from possible intruders." #npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$Lunara##br#
"These Rabbits are clever. Normal attacks have no effect on these enchantments. Fortunately, I have this Moonlight Mallet. The magic infused in this weapon has the ability to dispel this magic. Also, as you wander the cave with the Mallet, nearby Rice Cakes will begin to glow. Once you see that glow, slam that hammer down to break the enchantment." #npc$$1020$1#

#&7$Lunara##br#
"I'll even help you get a Magic Orb that will help you move around the cave. So, um, let me know when you're ready? I'm sure as an Envoy of Gaia, I don't need to tell you to be careful, but still! It would be a hassle if you alerted any Eclipse Rabbits." #npc$$1$1#|
6292|Alright, I'm ready to go. (Take the Moonlight Mallet and retrieve the Moonlight Rice Cakes)|

6296|What brought you here?|
6297|#&7$Immanuel##br#
"All right, take a seat and listen. We have lived in this area for a very long time. The purpose of us doing this is so that we can live free from danger." #npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
"So much for that, sadly. Somehow the Eclipse Rabbit King Calen learned of our Full Moon Festival, so he tried to raid our home one night. Those rabbits stole most of our Moonlight Rice Cakes. In the chaos, many of my people fled in a panic and have now gotten themselves lost. Guess we're a bit too sheltered." #npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
"I thought there was no hope for us. Then one of us got the brilliant idea to contact an Envoy of Gaia. They're quite powerful and some of them are even willing to help out folks like us. So that is why I am currently pestering you for help." #npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
"Not to be cheesy, but you being here is like a ray of light in the dark. I think you are definitely capable enough of helping us through this crisis. I hate begging, but desperate times calls for desperate measures. So please, help us!" #npcs70h+99$$1$1#|
6298|#&7$Immanuel##br#
"Hello, young one. I am the one called Immanuel, Elder of the  Moonlight Rabbits."#br##br#
#&53$The old Moonlight Rabbit lifts his head to look at you, ears perked forward in interest.##npcs70h+99$$1$1#|
6299|Can you tell me a bit more about this Full Moon Festival?|
6300|#&7$Immanuel##br#
"The Full Moon Festival is a long-held tradition of the Moonlight Rabbit Tribe. #br#
It takes place mid-year, when the moon is at its fullest. #br#
It's a time to thank those who have helped us in the past #br#
and an opportunity to pray for the moon's blessing." #npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
"In the past, we've always prepared a large amount of Moonlight Rice Cakes, #br#
which we then bring on the holiday and share with everyone. #br#
This was a way to bring the moon's blessings to all." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
"It's just a pity that the Moonlight Rice Cakes that we worked so hard to prepare for this year were all stolen by the Eclipse Rabbit King. #br#
Now our people don't know where they went. #br#
This is really a big problem." #npc$$2$1#|
6301|How greedy of those Eclipse Rabbits. How can I help?|
6302|#&7$Immanuel##br#
"This misfortune has ruined our original plans. #br#
The fact that the Eclipse Rabbit King stole the Moonlight Rice Cakes is giving me the biggest headache. #br#
If you're willing, you can go to the Bulletin Board and accept my quest. #br#
They will send you right away to meet someone I arranged on the inside." #npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
- Go to Candeo Village in Candeo Marsh and accept the Lv. 50 Rice Cake Crisis quest from the Mirabelle Bulletin Board. #br#
You can accept the quest once per day. #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
"If you don't feel you're ready yet, #br#
you can help find my scattered people, or you can help distribute the Moonlight Rice Cakes that we do have. #br#
Many people in the city have helped us a lot lately. #br#
I would like to show our gratitude with these Moonlight Rice Cakes." #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
- Quest Lv.25: Find the Moonlight Rabbits can only be accepted from Immanuel on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. It can only be accepted once per day. #br#

6303|#&7$Salvador##br#
"Hey, I'm Salvador. Need anything?" #br##br#
#&53$Salvador looks at you with a pressing curiosity.##npcs70h+99$$2$1#|
6304|Uh, yeah... I would like to help distribute the Moonlight Rice Cakes. (Daily)|
6305|#&7$Salvador##br#
"Do you now? These are our famous Moonlight Rice Cakes. Please be very careful with them; there aren't many left." #br#
#&53$With utmost care, Salvador gently places the rice cakes in your hands.##npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$Immanuel##br#
"If you're somehow confused, those rice cakes go to specific citizens of Navea: Baker Laura, Craftsman Karn, the Little Boy, Little Girl Jill and the Navean Priest. You don't have to hand them out to all of 'em. So long as at least three of the folks I mentioned get the rice cakes, I'll compensate you for your efforts." #npc$$1020$1#|
6306|#&7$Salvador##br#
"Thanks so much for your interest in helping us out! However, the rice cakes I had ready have already been distributed. We're making more, but they're not ready yet. Come back in a few days if you're still interested in helping us distribute them." #npcs70h+99$$2$1#

#&53$- The Rice Cakes can only be distributed once a day on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.##br#|

6309|#&7$Laura##br#
"This is a Moonlight Rice Cake, right? Wow, these aren't given out to just anyone...you sure you want to give this to me?"#br#
#&53$Laura looks at you with speculative surprise.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You repeat to Laura Immanuel's words.##char$$1201$0#

#&7$Laura##br#
"Wow...thank him for me, will you? I'll definitely accept."#npc$$1$1#|
6310|#&7$Karn##br#
"What is this thing? It's white and soft. Looks sorta tasty..."#br#
#&53$Curious, Karn gently prods at the rice cake with an index finger.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You pass Immanuel's message on to Karn.##char$$1201$0#

#&7$Karn##br#
"Oh, I see! Well, then I guess I'll take it." #npc$$1$1#|
6311|#&7$Little Boy##br#
"Woooaaaaah! That's a legendary Moonlight Rice Cake! Man, it looks really tasty!" #npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You repeat to the Little Boy Immanuel's words.##char$$1201$0#

#&7$Little Boy##br#
"Grandpa Immanuel is really giving me one? I'm gonna split this with my brothers, get them to stop fighting so much." #npc$$1$1#|
6312|#&7$Jill##br#
"Grandpa Immanuel made this, right? It reminds me of moonlight. Maybe it tastes like the Milky Way!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$She thinks it looks like moonlight? You study it for a bit, then shrug and tell her what Immanuel said.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jill##br#
"Grandpa Immanuel is really, really nice. I learned that friends are there to help each other. Can you please thank him for me?"#npc$$1$1#|
6313|#&7$Navean Priest##br#
"...This...for me? Surely you jest!"#br##br#
#&53$The Navean Priest stares at the rice cake in shock, then up at you, then back at the rice cake.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After repeating Immanuel's words, the priest humbly accepts with outstretched hands.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Navean Priest##br#
"Thank you so much! Please thank him for me...And tell him, if he ever needs help, he can seek me out!"#npc$$1$1#|

#&53$Salvador casts a spell on you.##npcs70h+99$$1120$1#|
6318|#&7$Salvador##br#
"The Moonlight Rice Cakes generate magic that I can sense. I can feel that magic still on you. I'm guessing you haven't yet distributed the Moonlight Rice Cakes. It is so very important that these rice cakes aren't wasted! Please distribute them to at least three people, then come back to me."#npcs70h+99$$2$1#

#&53$The jittery Moonlight Rabbit squints at you, curious and cautious at once.##npcs70h+99$$1$1#|
6320|Show the Missing Moonlight Rabbit the Moonlight Fortune.|
6321|#&7$Missing Moonlight Rabbit##br#
"Only a certain Moonlight Rabbit can create this. There's no worth in stealing it, so that could only mean... Did he send you to look for me?" #npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform the Rabbit that Immanuel did, indeed, ask you to find all the Moonlight Rabbits.##char$$1201$0#

6322|#&7$Missing Moonlight Rabbit##br#
"You have a Moonlight Fortune? I'll admit, there is something familiar about you, but I have no idea if you're some creepy fraud. I'll need proof that you can be trusted before I'll go anywhere with you."#br#
#&53$The rabbit lifts its head defiantly at you, quite guarded.##npcs70h+99$$1$1#

#&53$Use a Moonlight Fortune as proof.##br#|

"Only Moonlight Rabbits make Moonlight Rice Cakes. It is a rare and valuable dish. Surely you've made some sort of mistake here."#br#|
6325|#&7$Karn##br#
"A Moonlight Rice Cake? I thought these were only given to special people on special occasions..."#br##br#

6355|#&7$Dean the Scientist##br#
"Good question! When it works properly, it can teleport someone to the larger villages. But, since it doesn't work properly, it's just a mess. Where it'll take you now is completely random and oftentimes unknown."#npcs85h+70$$826$1#

#&7$Dean the Scientist##br#
"I've speculated the possibility that it transports the user to a parallel world, but I don't have enough solid data to be certain of this. Besides, with so many monsters lurking about wherever it takes you, it would be next to impossible to conduct any sort of worthwhile research."#npc$$828$1#

"The five disks you see here are where the Eidolons will appear. Each Eidolon appears at a different disk. This large disk at the center is where Vayu and Aelius appear. Keep in mind that they only stay for a short period of time." #npc$$821$1#

"Every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Eidolons will appear six times a day at 1 am, noon, 3pm, 5pm, 8pm and 10pm respectively. On Monday and Wednesday, Eidolons only appear for three times a day at noon, 5pm and 10pm respectively."#npc$$821$1#

"Long ago, legendary heroes protected the world with the signature weapons they created - the weapons we know of today. Back then, they were the first of their kind. As they trained, these heroes refined their strongest weapon techniques, until one day... An evil force stole these weapons and hid them away in a shrouded place."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Katrina##br#
"I suppose this evil thought that if it took the weapons, the Masteries would be lost to time. But the heroes were not deterred so easily. They wrote down the secrets to their Masteries so they could be passed down to the next generation. As a disciple of the Katar, it is my responsibility to pass down these secrets."#npc$$821$1#

"Patience, young one. You'll learn them in time, when you're ready to learn. The best way is to acquire Tokens by completing quests. You can then exchange those Tokens for written manuals containing the secrets of Masteries by talking to me."#npc$$821$1#

6518|#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"The Sky Tower is a uniquely magical place. It can hold up to 40 Envoys of Gaia at once, but it is not a good place for Eidolons. The Envoys of Gaia that enter must rely on their own strength to survive."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"You won't be alone, though. As I just mentioned, the Tower can hold up to 40 Envoys, so you can fight together. You can also use mounts and Glide as much as you can while inside."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"Ah, yes. Don't forget, though, that because of Sky Tower's unique environment, it is only open to Envoys two days a week, 15 times per day. Take advantage of these opportunities!"#npc$$821$1#|
6519|When is it open?|
6521|Can you please tell me about Raid Group registration?|
6522|#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"Your Raid Group will determine the Envoys of Gaia you will be teamed with when attacking Sky Tower.#br#

@This means it is possible to register with your friends to form your own Raid Group!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"Here are the registration time rules:"#npc$$822$1#

@So, if the Raid starts at 8 PM, registration will be available between 7 PM and 7:59 PM.#br#
@You are free to change sessions all you want during this time,#br#
@but once your scheduled raid starts, your positioned is locked and cannot be changed."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"Also, if you register successfully,#br#
@but don't enter the tower within 10 minutes if the raid starting,#br#
@you will be kicked out of the raid, and your spot will be taken by a late registrant.#br#
@If there are still openings available, you can try to register again."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"Don't worry!#br#
@Once you've done it a few times,#br#
@you'll get the hang of it!"#npc$$822$1#|
6523|What are the registration rules?|
6524|#&7$Sky Tower Clerk##br#
"From 10:01 PM on Sunday to 7:59 PM the following Saturday is open registration time. You can change when you want to raid any time you like during this time.

"The Helonia Coast just doesn't seem the same from all the way over here. Let me know when you want to leave."#npc$$821$1#|
6553|I want to brush up on the basics of fishing.|
6554|#&7$Preston##br#
"If you want to fish, you must first prepare and equip a Fishing Rod and Bait. Just go to a pool of water where there is a school of fish and click on it. This will bring up the Fishing Interface."#npc$$821$1##&V0009#

#&7$Preston##br#
"When a fish bites, the interface's large fish icon will flash. Click on that icon to enter manual fishing mode. If you don't click on that icon while it's flashing, auto-fishing will resume."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"A Bobber and control meter will appear while in manual fishing mode. The meter changes based on the fish being caught, and the bobber will move. If the meter stays blue, you're doing great, but once it turns yellow it means the fish is pulling free. Red means the line will snap."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"There are two additional bars at the top left of the Fishing Interface. The lower one refers to the durability of your fishing rod while the upper one shows your fish's endurance. If the bobber is over the yellow area, the rod's durability will drop. If it runs out completely, you'll lose your catch."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"However, if your fish's endurance runs out before that happens, the fish is yours!"#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"While you fish, the bobber moves constantly. To control it, hold down the left-mouse button over the large fish icon; the bobber will shift to the right. Do your best to keep the bobber in the blue area!"#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"If the bobber stays in the red area for more than three seconds, your line will snap and the fish will get away."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"One last thing to note: You won't get a bite every time you cast. The biggest thing about fishing is having patience. Well, I think that's everything...."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"I think it's time you go and try it out! I suggest going to Port Skandia and catching a Small Shrimp. Give it to Seth in Skandia. He'll assist you with the next step." #M119020$Preston$821$1#|
6555|I would like to know when and where the Fish Kings appear.|

you can take it to the nearest Anglers Anonymous Merchant to get rewards." Preston|
6557|Who are the Penguin Bandits?|
6558|#&7$Myrna##br#
"I have no idea where those pesky penguins come from. They like to attack a fisherman while he has a fish on the line and steal his catch. In order to protect the anglers and end these penguins' mischief, Anglers Anonymous has declared war on the Penguins!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Myrna##br#
"However, Anglers Anonymous has no actual plan to stop these penguins' cunning treachery. We're fishermen, not huntsmen or warriors, so we are offering a reward to someone who can stop them for good." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Myrna##br#
"This particular flock of Penguin Bandits concentrates on guarding the left door. Also, one of them seems to have proclaimed itself the leader. If you can snag the tokens these penguins carry, you can exchange them for rewards."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Myrna##br#
"There are a few different types of tokens: the Bandit Tokens carried by the Penguin Bandit Minions, the Small Tea Flowers carried by the Nymphets, and the Dagger carried by Nebuchadnezzar. If you can snag the tokens from the Nymphets or Nebuchadnezzar, then you'll be rewarded properly."#npc$$821$1#|

6563|I want to buy standard fishing equipment.|
6564|I want to buy standard lures.|
6565|I would like to know about the Ocean Tyrant.|
6566|#&7$Seth##br#
"The Ocean Tyrant... Anyone that runs a fishing boat shudders to that name. It's a huge short-tailed shark with a vicious temperament."#M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Rumor has it that this creature lurks near an island off the coast of Port Skandia. Many fishing boats that drifted there were attacked. The Ocean Tyrant tears the boat apart, waits for the sailors to fall into the water, then gobbles them up."#M01010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Since then, ocean fishermen don't dare go near that area. The locals gave the creature the name, 'Ocean Tyrant.' If you're crazy enough to see this monster for yourself, I can help you."#M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Recently, villagers have been talking about a mysterious fisherman who actually wants to go to that island. You can find him at 660, 440. He'll probably help you get out there."#M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Also, the Ocean Tyrant is remarkably fast. If you want to catch it, you'll need Speed fishing gear above level 4. I think you'll have better chances of catching it that way."#M101010$Seth$821$1#|
6567|I would like to know about the Shadow of the Deep.|
6568|#&7$Frazier##br#
"You're actually asking about the Shadow of the Deep? What an amazing swimmer! Most swift fish can swim 50 miles per hour or so, but this one tops one hundred!"#M110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"That's how this particular fish earned the name 'Shadow of the Deep' - you only manage a glimpse of a shadow in the water. It's too bad that this species of fish is endangered. If you manage to catch one and bring it to us alive, we can add it to a special breeding farm to give the species a fighting chance to exist."#M110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"Remember, this fish is big and lightning-quick. Anglers that hook it usually lose their fishing rods."#M110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot to tell you where The Shadow of the Deep can be found. It spends a lot of time at a nearby island off the coast. If you want to go there, there's a fisherman in Helonia that makes trips to the island often. You'll find him at  668, 476 when the Shadow of the Deep is scheduled to appear."#M110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"Keep in mind that the Shadow of the Deep has a lot of power. If you want to catch it, you'll have to use fishing equipment with power above level 4. I think you'll have better luck catching it this way."#M110020$Frazier$821$1#|
6569|I would like to know about the Golden Blossom.|
6570|#&7$Bennin##br#
"The Golden Blossom is a particularly special, particularly large fish. As for how it got its name, legend tells of a princess from a large kingdom that took a stroll in Crescent Hill. When she arrived at a waterfall, she suddenly slipped and fell into the water."#M106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"The few attendants that accompanied the princess didn't know how to swim. The princess felt certain she would drown, but then she felt a faint presence slowly lift her above water."#M106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"Once she was safely out of the water, she looked to see that it was a large, golden fish that saved her."#M106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"To express her gratitude, the princess granted the fish the name, 'Golden Blossom.' This name has stuck for generations."#M106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"This fish has been around for over 200 years. If you would like to see it, go to the pool at the waterfall across from me; maybe you'll catch a glimpse of it."#M106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"The Golden Blossom is a fish of skill, so if you wish to catch it, you'll need to use fishing equipment with skill above level 4. I think you'll be more successful that way."#M106020$Bennin$821$1#|
6571|I would like to know about the Ancient Witness.|
6572|#&7$Fargo##br#
"Oh? I never dreamed someone would actually want to know the story of the Ancient Witness. No one knows how long this fish has been alive for. Some of the locals believe that the electromagnetic pulse in Ancient Brevis is somehow connected to this fish."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"Fishing Association Archaeologists believe that this fish has lived for over several thousand years, attributing to its name. Residents of Brevis say that this fish's scales are quite valuable. They help the Dwarves develop their robot power sources."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"This fish only appears two or three times a year. Brevis dwarves are always seeking the fish's scales, but they usually come back empty-handed. Only a handful of folks have managed to find any."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"It has been so long since anyone has lived in Ancient Brevis that no one can say where this fish lives."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"If you're brave enough to go to Ancient Brevis, I won't stop you. The dwarves claim that the Ancient Witness can be found around there. Just be careful; that electromagnetic pulse is really strong."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"Also, the Ancient Witness is quite versatile. If you wish to catch it, you'll need all-around fishing equipment above level 4. I think you'll have better chances that way."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#|
6573|I would like to know about the Dark Crystal.|
6574|#&7$Lars##br#
"Legend speaks of an altar relic at the Caerment Altar.  An ancient creature has been guarding this altar for several hundred years, a creature called the Dark Crystal, made from the remnants of the Cube of Gaia." #M103010$Lars$821$1#

#&7$Lars##br#
"Everyone who has seen this lobster have stated that its body gleams brightly as though real crystals were imbedded into it.#M103010$Lars$821$1#

#&7$Lars##br#
"If you want to see for yourself, talk a walk around the altar there. Maybe you'll find it.#M103010$Lars$821$1#

6575|I'd like to know about the Hot Tempered Overlord.|
6576|#&7$Constance##br#
"Oh, I know everything about the Fierly Overlord! A long, long time ago, a giant crab emerged from the water to attack Triatio Highlands. No one could stop it."#M004020$Constance$821$1#

#&7$Constance##br#
"The locals at that time gave it the name, 'Hot Tempered Overlord' for that reason. Later, an unknown archmage managed to defeat the giant crab. He shrank it, then placed it in a lake fed by a waterfall."#M004020$Constance$821$1#

#&7$Constance##br#
"No one knows what happened to the archmage, but the crab still lives in that lake. Though it's tiny, its temperament is still huge. If you don't believe me, go see for yourself!"#M004020$Constance$821$1#

#&7$Constance##br#
"The Fiery Overlord is a skillful creature, so you'll need fishing gear with skill above level 4 to catch it. You'll have more success that way."#M004020$Constance$821$1#|
6577|I'd like to know about the Defender of the Marsh.|
6578|#&7$Peggie##br#
"Supposedly, the Defender of the Marsh is a creature not of this world. With how it looks, it's hard to doubt such a rumor. It's normally a very docile fish, but if infuriated, it'll drag people into the water."#M008010$Peggie$821$1#

#&7$Peggie##br#
"Many expert anglers have tried to catch this creature, but they've either returned with broken bones or not at all."#M008010$Peggie$821$1#

#&7$Peggie##br#
"You can find this fish near the small waterfalls in the Awlstone Forest. You'll need to be completely prepared to catch this dangerous fish."#M008010$Peggie$821$1#

#&7$Peggie##br#
"Remember that the Defender of the Marsh is a fish of great speed, so you'll have better chances of catching it with speed fishing gear above level 4."#M008010$Peggie$821$1#|
6579|I would like to know about the Rainbow Caller.|
6580|#&7$Alyssa##br#
"I'm glad I'm not the only one interested in the Rainbow Caller! When I first joined the Association, that fish was half the reason why!"#M104010$Alyssa$821$1#

#&7$Alyssa##br#
"Sometimes this fish will leap from the water, creating beautiful splashes of color, like weaving a rainbow. I think that's how it got its name."#M104010$Alyssa$821$1#

#&7$Alyssa##br#
"If you linger at the large waterfall behind me, you'll eventually see the fish leap out of the water to create these rainbows. Many locals visit this place just to see such splendor!"#M104010$Alyssa$821$1#

#&7$Alyssa##br#
"Too bad it doesn't happen more often. The Rainbow Caller has been splashing less and less lately. I really wish I could see it more often."#M104010$Alyssa$829$1#

#&7$Alyssa##br#
"If you want to catch this fish, keep in mind that it is quite powerful. You'll have better chances using fishing gear with power above level 4."#M104010$Alyssa$829$1#|
6581|I'd like to know about the Deep Waterfall Ghost.|
6582|#&7$Slash##br#
"Hey, I've also come here to see the Deep Waterfall Ghost as well! How neat! Too bad it's so hard to spot; it's such a rare and exotic fish. It's very good at hiding in the water."#M102030$Slash$821$1#

#&7$Slash##br#
"So many anglers have tried to catch this fish, using all sorts of methods, but no one has managed it."#M102030$Slash$821$1#

#&7$Slash##br#
"Also, there's an urban legend that states that one bite of this fish will make you invincible. I guess that's why it's always hunted, and why it's so good at hiding."#M102030$Slash$821$1#

#&7$Slash##br#
"Are you up for the challenge? You can find the Waterfall Ghost at a small waterfall veiled with spiderwebs west of Do you want to give it a try? This Deep Waterfall Ghost is at a small waterfall that is covered with spiderwebs in the west of Tafay Village. Good luck, I think you can do it!"#M102030$Slash$821$1#

#&7$Slash##br#
"Oh, one thing - the Waterfall Ghost is a fish of great skill. You'll have better chances of catching it if you use fishing equipment with skill above level 4."#M102030$Slash$821$1#|
6583|I want to know about the Sand-Spitting Hermit.|
6584|#&7$Falken##br#
"Hmm, you seem quite interested in the Sand-Spitting Hermit. Good! As you can see, the Star Sand Desert is a rather desolate place, mostly void of water."#M005030$Falken$821$1#

#&7$Falken##br#
"Interesting enough, though, there is an aquatic creature native to this area that can filter dirty, muddy water into drinkable water."#M005030$Falken$821$1#

#&7$Falken##br#
"The Sand-Spitting Hermit normally hides beneath the sand, emerging into the water only every so often. They're usually spotted in the waterfall at the Cactus Plateau. If you're lucky, you might see one."#M005030$Falken$821$1#

#&7$Falken##br#
"The Sand-Spitting Hermit is very versatile. You have a better chance of catching it with all-around fishing equipment above level 4."#M005030$Falken$821$1#|

"Come to me for all of your Alchemy needs! I have all sorts of wares prepared to assist you, but you'll need to gather your own herbs and ore. If you find a new formula, show it to me so I can help you examine it."#npc$$822$1#|
6689|#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"Nice to meet you! I've been sent here by Anglers Anonymous to assist you with fishing. Should you have any questions regarding fishing, please let me know."#npc$$822$1#|
6690|How do I start fishing?|
6691|#&7$Preston##br#
"If you want to fish, you must first prepare and equip a Fishing Rod and Bait. Just go to a pool of water where there is a school of fish and click on it. This will bring up the Fishing Interface."#npc$$821$1##&V0009#

#&7$Preston##br#
"When a fish bites, the interface's large fish icon will flash. Click on that icon to enter manual fishing mode. If you don't click on that icon while it's flashing, auto-fishing will resume."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"A Bobber and control meter will appear while in manual fishing mode. The meter changes based on the fish being caught, and the bobber will move. If the meter stays blue, you're doing great, but once it turns yellow it means the fish is pulling free. Red means the line will snap."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"There are two additional bars at the top left of the Fishing Interface. The lower one refers to the durability of your fishing rod while the upper one shows your fish's endurance. If the bobber is over the yellow area, the rod's durability will drop. If it runs out completely, you'll lose your catch."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"However, if your fish's endurance runs out before that happens, the fish is yours!"#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"While you fish, the bobber moves constantly. To control it, hold down the left-mouse button over the large fish icon; the bobber will shift to the right. Do your best to keep the bobber in the blue area!"#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"If the bobber stays in the red area for more than three seconds, your line will snap and the fish will get away."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"One last thing to note: You won't get a bite every time you cast. The biggest thing about fishing is having patience. Well, I think that's everything...."#M119020$Preston$821$1#|
6692|Can you tell me about fishing gear?|
6693|#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"Your reeling speed affects the the Bobber's movement speed. Your Fishing Line strength affects the width of the green Safe Zone. Your fishing rod's strength affects the fish's resistance."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"Next let me explain the different types of Fishing Rods and Gear.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"Speed equipment grants an especially high reeling speed. Skill equipment boosts your Fishing Line strength."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
Each type of fish behaves differently, so your Fishing Rod and gear is very important. Choose the best gear for each fish you try to catch.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
Oh right, there is Bait, too. There are certain types of Bait you should use to catch certain types of fish. Choose correctly and your chances of catching the fish you're after will improve vastly!"#npc$$821$1#|
6694|What are the different fish characteristics?|
6695|#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
I'll explain the different types of fish and what features they may have.#br#
First off, grey-quality fish can only be sold to merchants for coin.#br#
For the white-quality fish, Myrna, the Anglers Anonymous Director in Navea,#br#
will be handing out tasks regarding supplying fish stock. Completing the task will net you a handsome reward!#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"For orange-quality fish, you can obtain designs and materials for fishing equipment from them,#br#
and Fishing Merchants everywhere will give out quests related to those orange-quality fish.#br#
Completing the tasks they assign you will net you yet another handsome reward!#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
As for the gold-quality fish, those are the "Fish Kings" of each region.#br#
Unfortunately, they appear at random.#br#
When they do appear, they only stick around for 30 minutes,#br#
and to catch them, you need specialty Fishing Lures.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
After those 30 minutes, it'll take eight hours for them to appear again.#br#
If you want to catch a Fish King, you'll need a special Fish King Lure.#br#
Also, you need a Fishing Rod and Fishing Equipment above tier four#br#
to catch them."#npc$$821$1#|
6696|What can you tell me about the Penguin Bandits?|
6697|#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"Their leader is known as Nebuchadnezzar, he will only ambush anglers who successfully catch a Fish King. Then there's Nymphet, who will ambush anglers who successfully catch big fish."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"With ordinary fish, Penguin Bandits will ambush you. Be sure to teach them a lesson; they've stolen many a good fisherman's catch!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"The Penguins always carry tokens that show their membership to the Penguin Bandits. If you defeat one of them, make sure you take the token, then give it to Myrna, the Director of Anglers Anonymous, in Navea.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"There are a few different types of tokens. Bandit Tokens are carried by the Penguin Bandits, the Small Tea Flowers are carried by Nymphet, and the Daggers are carried by Nebuchadnezzar. Tokens from Nymphet or Nebuchadnezzar will get you a better reward!"#npc$$821$1#|
6698|I would like to know when and where the Fish Kings appear.|
6699|#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"Don't worry! I'll tell you when and where the Fish Kings appear!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Fishing Assistant##br#
"If no one catches them within 30 minutes,#br#
they'll go back into hiding. You'll have to wait until next time to catch them!#br#
If you do manage to catch a Fish King,#br#
you can take it to the nearest Anglers Anonymous Merchant to get rewards."#npc$$821$1#|
6700|#&7$Dyer##br#
"Ever since the Great Leviathan Nazrudin fell into an eternal slumber, evil forces have slowly overrun this world. Every Swirl Disciple believes that when Nazrudin wakes, he shall use his power to purify the world."#npcs70h+40$$1020$1#|
6701|Why is there a gigantic whirlpool here?|
6702|#&7$Dyer##br#
This is the entrance to the Whirlpool Abyss, the place where Nazrudin sleeps. In ancient times, nothing existed here except the ocean, but gradual change created the land and sealed away the entrance to the Whirlpool Abyss. Now you can only get there by passing through this whirlpool."#npcs70h+40$$2012$1#

#&7$Dyer##br#
"You cannot pass through the entrance if you are not over Level 60. Many powerful disciples within the Whirlpool Abyss protect Nazrudin's slumber."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Dyer##br#
"These disciples use various ice spells. If you do not defend yourself properly with Ice Attribute gear, you'll suffer heavy Ice damage."#npc$$2011$1#

#&7$Dyer##br#
"Not only do the Swirl Disciples use Ice spells, but they also have abilities that reduce your stats. If you cannot counter Negative Status skills, you might perish."#npc$$2011$1#

#&7$Dyer##br#
"I believe that you're powerful enough to awaken Nazrudin. Only by the strength of oceans can evil be completely purified."#npc$$2012$1#|
6703|#&7$Murphy##br#
"I am the Disciple in charge of protecting the Whirlpool Abyss. After Nazrudin fell into an eternal sleep, many Disciples were corrupted by his nightmares. They have stationed themselves by the Swirling Gate to prevent anyone from waking Nazrudin."#npcs60h+40$$2012$1#

#&7$Murphy##br#
"I, and other Disciples who have been untouched by his nightmares, remain to protect this place so that evil forces won't use this chance to invade the Whirlpool Abyss. Additionally, we're waiting for Dyer to recruit an Envoy of Gaiat to wake Nazrudin up."#npc$$2011$1#|
6704|#&7$Swirl Disciple##br#
"This isn't the Envoy of Gaia Dyer found for us, right? This person looks so weak and fragile!"#npcs80h+70$$821$1#|
6705|#&7$Swirl Disciple##br#
"Only those who have felt the awesome might of Great Leviathan Nazrudin themselves can understand his true power!"#npcs80h+60$$821$1#|
6706|#&7$Swirl Disciple##br#
"No one... can... compete... with the strength... of oceans...."#npcs70h+30$$821$1#|
6707|#&7$Swirl Disciple##br#
#&53$The disciple simply makes incoherent noises.##npcs90h+90$$821$1#|
6708|#&7$Swirl Disciple##br#
#&53$#It is impossible to under the disciple.#npcs90h+70$$821$1#|
6709|How do I wake the Great Leviathan up from his deep sleep?|
6710|#&7$Dyer##br#
"If you infuse the Swirl Crystals in the middle of the hall with your Power of Gaia, you can use the Swirling Gate to get to Nazrudin's lair."#npcs70h+40$$2011$1#

#&7$Dyer##br#
"Be warned: you will rouse the Swirl Disciples trapped in his nightmares. They will attack you with reckless abandon."#br##br#
#&53$-The Swirl Disciples use a variety of powerful - and long-lasting - Status Effects!##npc$$2011$1#

#&7$Dyer##br#
"The Swirling Gate will only stay open for 15 minutes. If you cannot awaken the Great Leviathan in that time, the Swirling Gate will close and Nazrudin will continue to sleep. It is imperative that you defeat the corrupted Swirl Disciples as quickly as possible!"#npc$$821$1#|
6711|What is the Whirlpool Abyss?|
6712|#&7$Dyer##br#
"The Great Leviathan Nazrudin has been asleep for many long years. He was the one that built this place so that his disciples could worship and protect him. When this world is brought to its knees by the darkness, he shall awaken, and the power of the oceans will wash away evil from the world."#npcs70h+40$$2012$1#

#&7$Dyer##br#
"Within the Whirlpool Abyss, you will be beset by 25 waves of attacking Disciples under control of the nightmares. Each wave will include powerful Swirl Disciples. For every five waves you withstand,  you awaken a different part of Nazrudin's consciousness, steadily drawing him out of his nightmare."#npc$$2011$1#|
6713|Pour the Power of Gaia into the Swirl Crystals (be sure that your party is ready).|
6714|#&7$Swirl Crystal##br#
#&53$Gusts of cold air race in all directions, gradually condensing into a frigid vortex.##npc$$821$1#|
6715|#&7$Swirl Crystal##br#
#&53$Ripples of bone-chilling air emanate from the Swirl Crystal. Some great power seems to be bound within it.##br##br#
#&53$-Swirl Disciples use a variety of powerful - and long-lasting - Status Effects!##npc$$821$1#|
6716|#&7$Marina##br#
"Hi, I'm Marina, pleased to meet you! What a beautiful day for hide and seek, don't you agree? I'm starting a game of Hide and Seek with three other masters of the game. There's a little girl, a little boy and an adorable little sprout hiding in Crescent Hill, just waiting for someone to find them."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Marina##br#
"I'll give you a prize if you can find just one of them! Just remember that once you've got your prize, you'll have to sit out for 10 minutes before you can participate again. Oh, and you're only allowed to find one hider at a time."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marina##br#
"Each hider will give you a different prize. So, if you want to collect a whole set of goodies, you'll need to be quick and clever!"#npc$$821$1#|
6717|I've found the little girl!|
6718|I've found the little boy!|
6719|I've found the little sprout!|
6720|#&7$Marina##br#
"I can see why folks call you the Envoy of Gaia - you're so quick! Here's your reward! You'll have to sit out for 10 minutes before you can participate again. You'll get different prizes when you find different hiders, so it's up to you if you want just one type of prize or different ones."#npc$$824$1#|
6721|#&7$Marina##br#
"Oh, you haven't found a hider yet? That's too bad! I can't give you a reward if you haven't found anyone. Maybe you've just a received a prize and haven't waited out the full 10 minutes yet. Or maybe your backpack is full and that's why you haven't received anything. Wanna check?"#npc$$828$1#|
6722|#&7$Little Girl##br#
"I'm the first hider of this round of Hide and Seek. Hurry up and find me if you want a prize!"#npc$$821$1#|
6723|Found the little girl!|
6724|#&7$Little Girl##br#
"What? I'm caught, already? I must be losing my touch. I suppose we'll have to go back to Marina now to get your prize."#npc$$825$1#|
6725|#&7$Little Girl##br#
"Yeah, right! You've already found another hider, or you've claimed your reward and haven't waited out the full 10 minutes again. Go somewhere else and check; you're blowing my cover!"#npc$$828$1#|
6726|#&7$Little Boy##br#
"I'm the second hider in this round of Hide and Seek. You can't find me if you can't see me!"#npc$$821$1#|
6727|Found the little boy!|
6728|#&7$Little Boy##br#
"And here I was thinking I had a fantastic hiding place. So much for that. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get this over and done with and find Marina to get your reward."#npc$$825$1#|
6729|#&7$Little Boy##br#
"Are you trying to cheat or something? You've already found another hider! Or you've already got your reward and just haven't waited out the full 10 minutes yet. Either way, you're giving me away, so run off and check."#npc$$828$1#|
6730|#&7$Little Sprout##br#
"I'm the third hider in this round of Hide and Seek. Grass Sprouts are great at this game!"#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|

6732|#&7$Little Sprout##br#
"I feel like I'm always getting picked on! Am I that bad at hiding or something? Well, we'd better to see Marina to get your prize."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|

"Hey, no fair! You've already found one of the other hiders! That, or you've already claimed your reward and haven't waited out the full 10 minutes. Uh-oh, I hear someone coming; go and check somewhere else before someone finds me!"#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|

6742|M-Margaret... Is that  you?|
6743|Who is this Margaret you speak of? I am called Aveline. Now, begone!|
6744|No, I will not leave! I'd recognize that voice anywhere; no one talks with such tender tones of cold indifference like my Margaret does! You are her!|
6745|I am not Margaret, nor do I know of anyone by that name! Leave here this instant!|
6746|I've known Margaret for so long! Your voice... Your tone... It is unmistakeable!|
6747|Out, puny human! I've had enough of your nonsense! Leave!|
6748|W-WAIT! Wait just one moment! Could you please allow me to see your face, just for a moment?|
6749|Do you have a death wish? Fine, whatever! Look and get lost!|
6750|It is you! You're Margaret!|
6751|I told you I'm not...|
6752|Why won't you admit it? Why? Do you not love me anymore?|
6753|...|
6754|No matter how you look, I can tell you're my one and only Margaret.|
6755|If you aren't her, then... Then there's no reason for me to keep on living!|
6756|Just... Just shut up.|
6757|Fine. I was Margaret. I was...|
6758|Now I am a monster, born to take revenge.|
6759|I don't care. You'll always be my beloved Margaret.|
6760|How could a weak human ever hope to survive alongside a monster?|
6761|Hey... Heath? How did you...?|
6762|(Wait, how does she know my name?)|
6763|(Don't tremble! There... There's nothing to be afraid of!)|
6764|Power... If I had power, I'd be able to survive alongside you, right?|
6765|Margaret, wait for me!|
6766|W- wait! Heath!!|
6767|O great God of Stone and Earth, grant me power!|
6768|If I bestow this power unto you, what will you give me in return?|
6769|Everything.|
6770|Good. Then you may undertake the Trial of the Stones.|
6771|If you can pass, I will give you strength!|
6772|Now, let us begin!|
6773|Wait for me, my Margaret!|
6774|You have a strong will, Human. I admire that.|
6775|You who are resolute, you may now receive my power!|
6776|A-ah! Yes... Such great power... I can feel it flowing through me!|
6777|I-is this my hand?|
6778|My... my body... Oh, no....|
6779|I... I've become a stone monster! I... this is....|
6780|Wait... I think this is just what I asked for....|
6781|As a weak human, I could never truly be with Margaret, could have never truly stood by her side.|
6782|But with this body, and this strength, I am finally worthy for Marg- no, Aveline's love!|
6783|My old life may be gone, but a new one awaits me.|
6784|I am Heath no more, but I do not regret it!|

6788|I'd like to buy some fireworks|
6789|How do I make my own fireworks?|
6790|#&7$Erwin##br#

6791|What is the Restoration Group working on right now?|

"The Restoration Group consists of people with a passion for studying prehistoric civilizations. We often travel to the far-flung corners of the world, doing our best to restore fragile - and utterly priceless - ancient ruins."#npc$$821$1#

5#&7$Lang##br#
"Judging by that glimmer of determination in your eyes, you also have a passion for preserving and restoring ancient artifacts!"#npc$$825$1#|
6793|Do you know Head Mythbuster Natalie?|
6794|5#&7$Lang##br#
"Natalie... Wait, you mean you've actually met her?"#npc$$823$1#

5#&7$Lang##br#
"OK, I'm going to tell you this in confidence, but only because I like your work ethic; you're trustworthy. Natalie is, in fact, my daughter."#npc$$822$1#

5#&7$Lang##br#
"I've dedicated my life to restoring ancient ruins, but Natalie has always had her head stuck in this myth-and-legend nonsense."#npc$$821$1#

5#&7$Lang##br#
"Why can't that child get it through her thick skull that she has to keep both feet on the ground and devote herself to serious pursuits! Instead, she's wasting her life, daydreaming and pursuing these outrageous fantasies. Not a one is found on the hallowed pages of real history! Why can't she understand the meaning and importance of protecting ancient monuments?"#npc$$826$1#

5#&7$Lang##br#
"Oh, where did I go wrong with her? What could I have done differently?"#npc$$829$1#|
6795|What are the Mythbusters all about?|
6796|#&7$Natalie##br#
"The Mythbusters are a group of dedicated individuals who are fascinated by myths from all over the world. We seek to learn the core of truth embedded in every mythical tale and song. That is our mission!"#npc$$821$1#

"Nothing is more exciting to me than reading about fantastical adventures and then discovering that they actually happened! You must feel the same way!"#npc$$824$1#|
6797|Do you know Restoration Leader Lang?|
6798|#&7$Natalie##br#
"Know him, I grew up with him! He's my father. Wait - he didn't send you here, did he?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Most people born into the world of archaeology get dragged into it, like they're inherently enthusiastic about the whole thing. But for me? The thought of wasting my days going into dusty old ruins to restore wasted buildings gets me anxious. I couldn't stand it."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"So why did I choose this path? It probably all started when my father used to read me bedtime stories about epic myths and legends. I'd go to sleep dreaming through those adventures and would always wake up wanting to know more."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Each tale was more enthralling than the last! How could I not get hooked on the mystery of it, of the emotions these grandiose legends instilled in me? I wish my father could see how much happiness these stories bring to people."#npc$$827$1#|
6799|Who are the Varan Bandits?|
6800|5#&7$Lang##br#
"Gah! The very name of those ruffians makes my blood boil! They're nothing but a bunch of grave robbers, relic plunderers, and treasure traffickers! Go to any site they've desecrated and nothing will be left but the dilapidated remains of whatever they couldn't carry. They ravish the sites to make them impossible to restore!"#npc$$826$1#

5#&7$Lang##br#
"The worst of the bunch is their leader, Zukitung. Not only will he have his underlings steal treasures from tombs, but they'll actually attack archaeologists, snatching precious artifacts from our very hands!"#npc$$821$1#

5#&7$Lang##br#
"According to the most recent reports, they've already scouted this very area. If they manage to seize these sacred artifacts... well, the consequences to that are just to great to think about!"#npc$$829$1#|
6801|Who are the Varan Bandits?|
6802|#&7$Natalie##br#
"The Varan Bandits are a bunch of black marketeers, a ruthless lot. We've encountered them before many times on our investigative journeys across the world."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"The Archaeology Association has declared them outlaws due to their brazen infiltration of historical sites and the despicable destruction they've wreaked. Zukitung is their leader."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"It took a lot of work to find this once-lost ancient ruin. Now, we hear that the Varan Bandits are also here. We must fight them back and protect this site's mythological heritage!"#npc$$821$1#|
6803|5#&7$Lang##br#
"Judging by the multitude of ancient ruins scattered throughout this forest, I'd say that some extraordinary event took place here. As leader of the Restoration Group, it is my duty to ensure this place is conserved!"#npc$$821$1#|
6804|#&7$Natalie##br#
"So far, we've found a crumbling tome written by an ancient nobleman, mysterious runes inscribed on an eroding breastplate... The evidence marked on these artifacts points to what we've been searching for all these years! This place is the origin of all myths, the beginning of culture itself! What happened?

"Hello, young adventurer! I'm a Priest of the Church, travelling the world and ministering to those in need. My name is Nicolas. Blessings upon you!" #br##br#
#&53$The Priest smiled and nodded.##M316012$Nicolas$824$1#|
6865|Nicolas, how much do you know about the Winter Village?|
6866|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Actually, this Small Winter Village looks exactly like what we saw. It's just an ordinary village. Apart from the cold, and being covered under snow throughout the year, there's nothing special about this village." #br##br#
#&53$Nicolas flicks the snow off of his shoulder.##M316012$ Nicolas$2$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"The villagers in the Small Winter Village have lived in this cold weather for many, many years. This has given them a certain tenacity. Outsiders joke that the villagers are made of stone!"#br##br#
"Now that I think about it, this might be a clever description!"#M316012$ Nicolas$821$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"But as long as you get to know the villagers, it's not hard to find their kinder sides. Their stoic attitude is just their way of surviving the weather. I'm confident that, in time, I can bring the villagers to have warm smiles, like they used to have." #M316012$ Nicolas$822$1#|
6867|How goes the ministering?|
6868|#&7$Nicolas##br#
#&53$Nicolas sneezes loudly.##M316012$Nicolas$1011$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"It really is quite cold out here!"#br##br#
"I respect these people, living under these conditions! I just wish they'd be more open to help!"#M316012$Nicolas$828$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Although a flame may warm a cold body, the coldness inside the heart will not fade away so easily. I think that, until the villagers' hearts warm to me, it will be quite hard for them to accept the church." #M316012$Nicolas$829$1#|
6869|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"I'm happy to see you here, young Envoy of Gaia. Are you also here for the Holy Tree Event? Everyone in the village is busy getting ready for it!" #br##br#
#&53$The Priest looked around with a warm smile.##npc$$824$1#|
6870|What is a Holy Tree?|
6871|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Ho ho, the Holy Tree is very special. It's a normal seed grown under a special blessing of the church. Since it was blessed, not only will it grow in a short time, but also can spread blessings to people with open hearts." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Although the Holy Tree grows much faster than a normal tree, the nutrition it needs are the same. It needs sufficient water to be able to grow."#br##br#
#&53$The Priest explains, slowly.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"When the Holy Tree is completely grown, it will give different blessings, according to the blessings it received while growing."#br##br#
"There are three Holy Trees currently in Port Skandia. I hope you can go there to feel the blessings."#br##br#
#&53$Nicolas kindly nods at you.##npc$$824$1#|

#&53$You struggle through the snow to reach the Winter Village, but it's taking longer than you planned. You curse your bad luck as you look for the one who submitted the request. Eventually you spot a man in a red, padded jacket waving at you.##M316012$ Nicolas$822$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Oh, great! Finally! Someone who can help!"#br##br#
#&53$The old man in the strange outfit looks kind of familiar. ##M316012$ Nicolas$824$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"I've been trying to spread some supplies through the Winter Village. That's why I asked for an adventurer's help, but nobody seemed to be showing up, so I started working on it myself." #M316012$$829$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"I accidentally let the sleigh slide down the hill though, so now I'm trying to recollect all of the gifts. Since you're here, you think you could help? I could also use a hand collecting materials to repair the sleigh."#br##br#
#&53$You nod and say that you will help.##M316012$ Nicolas$821$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Please collect five Wooden Planks, five Ropes and five Inedible Red Fruits. You can find these things in the Small Winter Village, and we can use them to repair the sleigh. After that, we can leave for the Small Winter Village, and give them a nice surprise!" #M316012$ Nicolas$824$1#|
6877|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Hmm... It seems like your bag has no space for a Wood Cutter's Axe. Could you make some room?"#br##br#

#&53$Nicolas watches the villagers decorate.##npc$$824$1#|
6880|#&7$White Beard##br#
"Relax! I'm not your enemy. Just put your weapon down."#br##br#
#&53$A creature that looks a little like a deer is staring at you. It definitely isn't a deer, though.##npcs40h+85$$822$1#|
6881|What happened here?|
6882|#&7$White Beard##br#
"One cloudy night the Dark Sprite, Daq, attacked us while we slept. Daq hates light, particularly from fireworks. His attack plunged the whole village into darkness. He even stole our fireworks and hid them."#npcs40h+85$$822$1#

#&7$White Beard##br#
"With nothing left to stop him, he turned most of the villagers into monsters. Thanks to the Guardian Sprite's power, some of us were able to maintain our sanity. We split into two teams: one team to set up the remaining Spirit Torches inside the village, one to defend them and find more help."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$White Beard##br#
"I'm worried about the first team though. We haven't seen them since we split up. They could have fallen completely under Daq's spell! Please, can you help?"#npc$$822$1#|
6883|How can I help you?|
6884|#&7$White Beard##br#
"According to our plan, the villagers who left earlier should've finished setting up the Spirit Torches at three different locations inside the village by now. The Spirit Torches should be able to offset Daq's magic and clear away his illusions."#npcs40h+85$$822$1#

#&7$White Beard##br#
"Lighting the torches will be difficult because the mist conceals monsters. Worse, I'm not sure any of us can withstand his magic anymore. Right now, you are our only hope."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$White Beard##br#
"You don't have to worry about finding them. Our village's Guardian Sprite, Floret, will lead the way. I'm sure that you can complete this task. Come get the match from me, as soon as you are ready."#npc$$822$1#|
6885|Take the match. (Story Begins)|
6886|#&7$White Beard##br#
"Thanks to you, our village is saved!"#npcs40h+85$$822$1#

#&7$Berlioz##br#
"Masteries... That's a long story..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Berlioz##br#
"A long, long time ago, legendary heroes trained themselves to the limits of human potential. Every type of weapon we have today was once associated with the hero who first mastered it. Then, one day, an evil power snatched their weapons, and hid them in a mysterious hall."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Berlioz##br#
"Those heroes who lost their weapons didn't want to let the skills they had trained so hard to master be forgotten. Therefore, they composed books describing their Masteries so that they could be passed from generation to generation. As a disciple of the hero of the Bow, I have passed Masteries along."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Berlioz##br#
"%p%, I assume that you would like your master become stronger, am I right?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% nods.##pet$$823$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You continue to ask about how to learn and use those skills.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Berlioz##br#
"Be patient. As long as you're good enough, the best way is to collect Tokens by completing quests. If you have enough Tokens, you can get a copy of the Mastery book from me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Berlioz##br#
"After using the book, the Masteries will appear in the Mastery section of the Skills Interface. Drag the Mastery to the space on the left to use it. If you've got it, then you can go start collecting Tokens now!"#npc$$821$1#

"We've always used some fireworks during the festival, but they're kinda tricky to get into the sky and exploding correctly."#npcs70h+85$$825$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"I still remember last year's festival, when the princess volunteered to set off the fireworks. Unfortunately, she accidentally launched the fireworks at the King. The King was wounded, some of his hair got burnt... it was a mess all around."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elle Fisher##br#
"If you want to fish, you must first prepare a Fishing Rod and Bait, then equip them. After that, you need to go to a pool with a school of fish in it and click on the school. That will open the Fishing Interface so you can start fishing." #npc$$821$1##&V0009#

"When a fish bites, the Interface's Large Icon will turn into a Fish Icon. When that happens, click the Fishing Interface's Icon and you can enter the Manual Fishing Mode. If you don't click on the icon while it's flashing, automatic fishing will continue." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elle Fisher##br#
"A Fish Bobber and Control Meter will appear while in Manual Fishing mode. The Control Meter will vary based on the fish being caught. The Bobber will also move at different speeds.

#&7$Elle Fisher##br#
"Also, there are two Durability Bars at the top left of the Fishing Interface. The top one shows the Fish's Endurance, while the bottom one represents the Fishing Rod's Durability. Whenever the Bobber is in the yellow area, the Fishing Rod's Durability will drop. If it runs out, the fish will escape."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elle Fisher##br#
"If the Fish's Endurance runs out first, it means your catch is successful!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elle Fisher##br#
"When you're fishing, the Bobber will move constantly. To control it you need to move the mouse over the large icon. Then, as the situation demands, hold down the left mouse button, and the Bobber will move to the right. Do your best to keep the Bobber in the safe zone."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elle Fisher##br#
"If the Fish Bobber stays in the red zone for longer than 3 seconds, the fish will snap your line and you won't catch anything."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maybelle##br#
"Recently he's had an urge to explore some strange, weird places. Those places seem very dangerous, and that worries me a lot. But he's so keen on it, there's nothing I can do."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Takezo##br#
"Long ago, legendary heroes protected the world with the signature weapons they created - the weapons we know of today. Back then, they were the first of their kind.

#&7$Takezo##br#
"I suppose this evil thought that if it took the weapons, the Masteries would be lost to time. But the heroes were not deterred so easily. They wrote down the secrets to their Masteries so they could be passed down to the next generation. As a disciple of the Tachi, it is my responsibility to pass down these secrets."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Takezo##br#
"Patience, young one. You'll learn them in time, when you're ready to learn. The best way is to acquire Tokens by completing quests. You can then exchange those Tokens for written manuals containing the secrets of Masteries by talking to me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Takezo##br#
"Once you've read the book, that Mastery will appear in the Mastery section of the Skills interface. Drag your Masteries to the space on the left to prepare them. What do you think? Simple, isn't it? Now, go and collect Tokens!"#npc$$821$1#

I'm going to make an exception and tell you what I know - I don't usually do this for others." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$"I don't know if you've noticed the bright and beautiful mushrooms in Mushroom Forest.##br#
It's a shame that so many of those mushrooms can't be used for cooking - only one variety isn't poisonous!#br#

@That's why I came all the way out here!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Unfortunately, the forest has been swallowed up by war.#br#
@There's nothing I can do.#br#
@If you happen to see any delicious mushrooms,#br#
@could you bring them back for me?" #npc$$821$1#|
7140|What is this secret dish?|
7141|#&7$Marvin##br#
"Are you asking me what the mysterious mushroom dish is? #br#
@Ha! That's a good question." #br#
@Marvin continues happily. #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Do you remember the Chef in Candeo Marsh? #br#
@He told me that those who wish to taste the greatest mushroom dishes - those only known to the greatest gourmands - 
@must come here to meet up with his younger brother Schiff."

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I wanted Schiff to cook me some mushroom dishes, #br#
@but he said there are no fresh mushrooms now because of the war. #br#
@And he doesn't want to risk his life searching all over for mushrooms. #br#
@So he asked me to go and find some on my own..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Well, it's as he said: #br#
@though I've been in some tough scrapes before, #br#
@even I wouldn't walk through this warzone alone...#br#
@Does this mean I need to give up?"#npc$$829$1#|
7142|Where can I find the mushrooms you want?|
7143|#&7$Marvin##br#
"Schiff said that those are Magic Mushrooms.#br#
When they're not ripe, they give off a faint scent and can be used for seasoning,#br#
but they're not what we want!#br#
We want the rich, exotic flavor of the fully ripe Magic Mushroom."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"The ripe Magic Mushrooms give off an exotic fragrance.#br#
Just one whiff will send you reeling!#br#
The flavor can be too strong for some.#br#
It can really knock your socks off."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"They can only be prepared by a professional chef.#br#
If you pass through the south-west corner of Mushroom Village,#br#
could you do me a small favor?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Take three Magic Mushrooms to Schiff in Mushroom Village so he can cook them.#br#
Make sure they're good and strong!"#br#
 Marvin says, looking at you excitedly.#npc$$825$1#|
7144|Give Marvian a piece of the marinated Magic Mushrooms.|
7145|#&7$Marvin##br#
"This bag...#br#
@Couldn't it really contain such a legendary item?" #npc$$823$1#

"Are you telling me that these Magic Mushrooms were marinated by Schiff?" #br#
@Hmm... Well, let's take a look, I guess..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Mm! It has a hearty and warm flavor! #br#
@Oh my! #br#
@This is so delicious!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
@Marvin shovels some of the mushrooms into his mouth. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Not bad... #br#
@Not really good either, though.#br#
@Why don't you try?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"That is kind of disappointing.#br#
@Are these really the fabled mushrooms? #br#
@Bleh. It looks like there's something oozing out of them." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"Hang on... Why are there two of you now? #br#
@No, not just you... #br#
@Everything had doubled. Or tripled..." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Marvin##br#
"I feel amazing! #br#
@It's like the whole world is dancing with me! #br#
@The sky is filled with suns!" #npc$$821$1#

7146|#&7$Schiff##br#
"If you're going to eat well on the battlefield,#br#
@you need to find the right ingredients to supplement your rations.#br#
@Any chef worth their salt can do that.#br#
@So, prove your skill as a military chef!"#npc$$821$1#|
7147|Any dishes you'd recommend?|
7148|#&7$Schiff##br#
"There isn't a lot to eat around here.#br#
@Your best bet is going to be mushrooms.#br#
@They can be used as either a main dish or a side."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"They smell so wonderful before they're ripe,#br#
@making them a perfect supplement.#br#
@Their texture is perfect when they ripen,#br#
@even if the taste is a far too rich."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"Boiling or grilling them helps, #br#
@but it also ruins their texture.#br#
@Unfortunately, if you don't boil or grill them, the taste makes them pretty much inedible.#br#
@Chefs have been trying to find a way to prepare them for years."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"After dozens of attempts,#br#
@I think I've finally found a way to do it. You just need the right marinade!#br#
@The problem is I don't have any mushrooms to try it on.#br#
@If you could get me some, I'd be happy to share my success with you."#npc$$821$1#|
7149|Where can I find the mushrooms?|
7150|#&7$ Schiff ##br#
"If you pass through the southwest corner of Mushroom Village,#br#
@pick a few Magic Mushrooms for me, will you?#br#
@Ripe Magic Mushrooms would be best, the ones with strong flavor.#br#
@Then I can cook some for you to try."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Schiff ##br#
"It's impossible to determine the ripeness of a Magic Mushroom by its appearance,#br#
@but a ripe Magic Mushroom gives off a strong, exotic odor.#br#
@When you smell it, the overpowering scent will make you feel faint.#br#
@If you get close enough, you should be able to tell the ripe ones from the unripe ones."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$ Schiff ##br#
"You need roughly three mushroom per dish. #br#
@The preparation takes some time, so please be patient!"#npc$$822$1#|
7151|Could you make me some of your mushrooms?|
7152|#&7$Schiff##br#
"Great! I know this is going to work!#br#
@Give me a second and we'll see if this works!"#br#
@Schiff eagerly collects his spices and cooking implements.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"First we need to take the mushrooms... oh wow, I didn't realize they smelled -that- strong!#br#
@Ahem..."#br#
@You can actually smell the mushrooms from here.#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"The first step is easy!#br#
@You just need to cut the mushrooms into small slices.#br#
@Ahem..."#br#
@The smell actually increases as he cuts into the mushrooms.#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"After you cut them, you need to prepare the marinade.#br#
@Sorry, these spices are a secret, so I can't tell you what they are.#br#
@Put them all in a bag and shake them together to complete the marinade!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"Now you just need to put the mushrooms in the bag,#br#
@then squeeze out the air and let the mushrooms soak!#br#
@I like burying the bag underground... after I've sealed it, of course."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"Now we just need to wait forty-nine days for it to finish marinading!#br#
@Don't look at me like that! You can't rush perfection!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"Hah! Relax!#br#
@We don't have a choice.#br#
@If we don't let it marinade, the taste will be absolutely vile."#br#
@Schiff shrugs as you continue to stare at him.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Schiff##br#
"Don't fret! Another adventurer brought me some mushrooms forty-nine days ago on the nose!#br#
@That means you're in luck! I can let you try those right now!#br#
@So, you want them? It is the least I could do for you."#br#
@Schiff offers you a bag of marinaded mushrooms.#npc$$822$1#|
7153|#&7$Schiff##br#
"I think three mushrooms makes for a good dish.#br#
@Think you could bring me some more?"#npc$$821$1#

* Make sure you have at least three Magic Mushrooms.|
7154|#&7$Dirk##br#
"How could this... agh, how could this is be!#br# 
@How could I, the future savior of the world, lose to that bunch of amateurs?#br#
@If that old man hadn't stolen my Grimoire,#br#
@I surely would have been victorious!"#npc$$829$1#|
7155|You seem to be having a spot of trouble.|
7156|#&7$Dirk##br#
 "You came just in time. I'd like your opinion.#br#
 Do you think that someone like me could 
lose to that bunch of amateur weaklings?"#br#
 Dirk's face flushes red. #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
 "Don't you understand what I'm saying? #br#
That's why I hate you amateurs...#br#
Forget it. I'll just tell you what happened from the very beginning,"#br#
 Dirk says impatiently. #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
 "You've heard of Fel Town, I take it? #br#
It's a small town southeast of here#br#
 where mages often gather."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Dirk##br#
 "They call themselves mages, but compared to me#br#
 they're a bunch of nobodies.#br#
 No one on the planet is better than me,"#br#
 Dirk says, looking you up and down. #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
 "But from that day on, everything changed. #br#
The mages suddenly started rioting and attacked me." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
 "How could someone as strong as I am lose to those novices and be forced to flee? #npc$
How could this have happened?"#br#
 Dirk sighs bitterly. #npc$$829$1#|
7157|You need some help?|
7158|#&7$Dirk##br#
"Don't tell anyone this... #br#
@But my left hand holds a great, demonic power.#br#
@When combined with the Grimoire I've written,#br#
@my powers should be unstoppable."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"I only have to quietly incant the spells from the Grimoire,#br#
@and I could send you sailing through the sky.#br#
@Even the Shadow Knight's army would be no match for me."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"But my Grimoire was stolen by that old man, and then sealed. #br#
@Now, I've lost the power of the Grimoire...#br#
@Without it, I can't control the demonic power in my left hand."#br#
@Dirk appears pained. #npc$$829$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"You ask what connection the Grimoire has to my demonic left hand? #br#
@If I use my left hand without the power of the Grimoire,#br# 
@its powers will run amok!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"If I go to Fel Town now,#br#
@I'm afraid my powers will run wild and get me into trouble.#br#
@As savior of the world, I have too many missions to complete...#br#
@I can't die just yet!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"So, as a layman,#br#
@take the Unsealing Incantation to Fel Town,#br#
@and find my sealed Grimoire for me.#br#
@Remove the seal, and bring it back to me."#npc$$826$1#|
7159|What's happening to my power?|
7160|#&7$Dirk##br#
"Are you interested in the demonic power of my left hand? #br#
@Such a nosy amateur! #br#
@It's not that I can't tell you...#br#
@After all, looking after the weak and frail is my duty!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"When I was young, I had an accident,#br#
@and my left hand was seriously wounded.#br#
@The doctor said I would never use it again."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"I'm meant to be the savior of the world.#br#
@How could I lose my hand to such a minor injury? #br#
@From that time on, he called to me!"#br#
@Dirk swallows excitedly before continuing. #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"He lent me his energy from the depths of Pandemonium,#br#
@but made me promise him my soul after I died.#br#
@Since it falls to me to save the world, though,#br#
@I had no choice but to accept his offer."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"Soon after that, the wound healed,#br#
@and my left hand seemed to change and evolve,#br#
@gaining a strong demonic power.#br#
@With this power, I was invincible."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"Wahaha!#br#
@Ha! Ha ha!#br#
@Dirk loses himself in laughter. #npc$$824$1#

 "I am certain my Grimoire is sealed inside a decorative box.#br#

#&7$Dirk##br#
 "Remember, whatever you do, don't read the Grimoire!#br#

says Dirk theatrically.#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Dirk##br#
"Don't dare look inside before it's been unsealed.#br#
Although the Grimoire's magic has been sealed#br#

 "You look confused,#br#

 than just sit here waiting for the war to be over."#npc$$821$1#|

"I have been ordered to stay here and protect Madame Tatiana."#npc$$1$1#

"I am certain the Second and Third Princes will be able to defeat the Charm Queen,"#br#
Shalen says reassuringly.#npc$$821$1#|
7238|#&7$Alex##br#
"You have seen the treachery that the Charm Queen is capable of.#br#
 If we can't think of a strategy to deal with her, the battle is as good as lost."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Even though Odum and Para are performing well on the battlefield, #br#
pressing into enemy territory is just too dangerous...#br#
As the situation currently stands, I think caution would be advisable."#npc$$1$1#|
7239|#&7$Penny##br#
"Of course I know it's dangerous on the battlefield,#br#

#&7$ Kali##br#
"Although the fighting doesn't pose a major threat at the moment, it still causes injuries.#br#
 If things continue like this, then we might run out of medical supplies,"#br#
 Kali says with a worried look.#npc$$828$1#|

7246|Second Prince Para Ryan's Introduction|
7247|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"We're using up resources far faster than expected...#br#
@It looks like we'll have to find some substitutes before the supplies get here."#npc$$1$1#|
7248|#&7$Carrick##br#
"Officer Victoria,#br#
@I've written about the attack in my letter.#br#
@This is a key moment in the war."

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I agree that the rescue operation is important.#br#
@But in addition to military supplies,#br#
@in order to break through the stalemate,#br#
@we'll still need troop reinforcements."#npc$$1$1#|
7249|#&7$Victoria##br#
"General, I'm aware that the Attack Corps is short of supplies.#br# 
@I've already passed on an application for supplies to Lawrence.#br# 
@When we've received the supplies, we'll send them over immediately." 

#&7$Victoria##br#
"I'm afraid I'm unable to concede on the point of troop deployment.#br#
@The captured Emerald Town residents are in mortal danger.#br#
@We need to view the rescue operation as a top priority."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Only if we save the residents,#br#
@will we be able to deploy troops to the front."#npc$$1$1#|
7250|#&7$Old Villager##br#
"It's all happened too fast.#br#
@There's been no time to react...#br#
@But I'm unable to help."#npc$$1$1#|

"I'll definitely make those Gnomes regret it.#br#
@Let them witness the real power of ancient technology!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
7252|#&7$Montero##br#
 "Augustus and I will strike with full force at#br#
 those who destroyed Turbine Settlement."#M012021s85h+70$Montero$2$1#|
7253|#&7$Zachary##br#
"What a headache!#br#
@If it weren't for those annoying creatures,#br#
@the reconnaisance operation would go much more smoothly."#npc$$1$1#|
7254|#&7$Bessie##br#
"The captive Emerald Town residents can't hold out much longer.#br#
@We've got to work quickly now.#br# 
@I hope we receive the order for the rescue operation soon."#npc$$1$1#|
7255|#&7$Old Villager##br#
"Folks, just hang on a while longer...#br#
@I'll save you very soon."#npc$$1$1#|
7256|#&7$Jerry##br#
"Finally... I've escaped from that accursed place.#br#
@I felt like I was going to die..."#npc$$1$1#|

"I knew Slim Sye wouldn't let us down!#br#
@He was a worthy choice."#npc$$1$1#|

"This is not the time to drop our defenses.#br#
@We can't give these Gnomes an inch of breathing room."#npc$$1$1#|
7260|#&7$Zoy##br#
"I don't know whether the supplies I discussed with Lawrence have arrived yet.#br#
 Our medical supplies are nearly exhausted,#br#
 so we're pretty worried."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"I've been racing back and forth between battlegrounds#br#
 in hopes that I #br#
 can save just a few more people."#npc$$821$1#|
7261|#&7$Pierre##br#
 "The search area is sizable.#br#
 Finding the scepter won't be easy."#M012011s85h+70$ Pierre$2$1#|
7262|#&7$Reymon##br#
"Slim Sye is only concerned with retrieving the scepter."#br#
@We've got to find it. We can't let his efforts be in vain."#npc$$1$1#|
7263|#&7$Carrick##br#
"They're able to withstand our attacks.#br#
@The Karok Gnomes must have a secret."#npc$$1$1#|
7264|#&7$Abu##br#
 "It's not a good idea to just keep hiding here.#br#
 We need to look for an opportunity to escape."#M051011s85h+70$Abu$1$1#|

7268|#&7$Victoria##br#
"Whether or not we'll be able to reclaim Emerald Marsh#br#
@depends entirely on this battle...#br#
@We cannot lose."#npc$$1$1#|

You get used to the pain."#br#
 The stone guard covers his face with his hands as if he were trying to hide something.#npc$$501$1#|
7278|#&7$Makar Sorcerer##br#
"These all-day shifts are too much to take,#br#

@I'll handle things here."#npc$$1$1#|
7284|#&7$Victoria##br#
"No mercy...#br#
@for anyone in alliance with the Shadow Knight!"#npc$$1$1#|
7285|#&7$Mandon##br#
"Listen up! Whether we can stop the Eldador Marauders depends on this battle!#br#
@Thanks to your previous efforts,#br#
@the number of Granary Guards has significantly decreased.#br#
@The thing is, the Church Army is facing a similar problem.#br#
@That's why we need you to help destroy the Eldador Marauders' grains."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mandon##br#
"I've got five torches here. Everyone take one,#br#
@and use it to burn as many haystacks as possible.#br#
@While you're at it, watch out for any Granary Firemen you may encounter.#br#
@Do what's necessary to prevent them from extinguishing the fire.#br#
@And we'll be guarding the exit, in case the enemies try to escape and get help."#npc$$821$1#|
7286|Hand me the torch. I'm ready!|
7287|#&7$Daisy##br#
"Dang. I burned the fish again!"#M002040$Daisy$829$1#|
7288|#&7$Mandon##br#
"Okay, now you've got your torch! Go burn the Eldador Marauders' grains, now!"#npc$$821$1#|
7289|#&7$Timantha##br#
"The Campfire Banquet is almost ready!#br#
@In addition to launching fireworks, the staff will also be dancing to liven things up!#br#
@Not that we'll need it. The firewood is from the Sprite Forest.#br#
@Strange things will happen when it burns. Those close to it?#br#
@They'll be blessed by the forest and gain some EXP."#npc$$821$1#
|
7290|I want to learn more about the Campfire Banquet!|
7291|When is it going to be, and how long will it last?|
7292|#&7$Timantha##br#
The Campfire Banquet is held every day, from 12:00 - 24:00.#br#
@Each banquet will last 20 minutes,#br#
@and you can only hold one banquet a day!"#npc$$821$1#|
7293|#&7$Erlar##br#
"Hello, I'm Erlar, the Investigation Team Lieutenant.#br#
@The Immemorial Beast Summoners are going to perform a ritual,#br#
@to incubate an Immemorial Beast Egg that was once considered extinct!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erlar##br#
"We've got to kill the Immemorial Beast Summoners to stop the ritual.#br#
@We cannot afford to let the Immemorial Beast break out of its shell. #br#
@I've already got someone on the inside - they'll lead the way for you.#br#
@Also, leave the guards at the entrance to me. I'll take care of them!"#npc$$822$1#|
7294|Got it. We're on our way!|
7295|#&7$Rollena##br#
"It's so exciting transforming unassuming materials #br#
into something completely new! Using professional methods and techniques,#br#
you can produce things that no one has ever seen before.#br#
 It's like a fairytale, don't you think?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Rollena ##br#
"To bring happiness to all,#br#
 I'll try even harder in my study of alchemy!"#br#
 the young lady says to you energetically.#npc$$824$1#|
7296|What are you doing here?|
7297|#&7$Rollena##br#
"Hello. I didn't think that I'd meet anyone who wasn't a soldier here.#br#
You must be pretty amazing!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$ Rollena ##br#
"I came here to find some Holy Water in order to create #br#
a Sage Stone.#br#
It is said the waters of Waterweed Wetland hold a mysterious power,#br#
so we alchemists call it Holy Water."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rollena ##br#
"In the past, collecting Holy Water wasn't that difficult,#br#
 but the war has made it much more dangerous.#br#
 Now that I'm here in person, I can see that the situation is far from ideal...#br#
 These monsters are much too strong for me,"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Rollena ##br#
"I was originally planning to go to Waterweed Wetland to fetch some Holy Water,#br#
 but on the way there I was surrounded by monsters.#br#
 There were far too many for me to defeat on my own.#br#
 Luckily, soldiers came to my rescue."#npc$$821$1#

Rollena ##br#
"If I give up now, #br#
the old man's illness will only get worse.#br#
 What else can I do?"#br#
 Rollena says anxiously.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$ Rollena##br#
"I need a Sage Stone to cure an old man's illness. #br#
For someone like you, getting to Waterweed Wetland would be a walk in the park.#br#
 Can I enlist your aid?"#br#
 Rollena asks with a bow.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod to stop her from worrying. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rollena##br#
"Really? Oh, thank you so much!#br#
 Please take this Alchemy Bottle to Waterweed Wetland. Fill it with Holy Water,#br#
 then bring it back to me.#br#
 I wish you a safe journey."#npc$$821$1#|
7298|#&7$Rollena ##br#
"Please take this Alchemy Bottle to Waterweed Wetland. Fill it with Holy Water,#br#
 then bring it back to me.#br#
 I wish you a safe journey."#npc$$821$1#|
7299|I have the Holy Water you need.|
7300|#&7$Rollena##br#
"Welcome back! Did you get hurt at all?#br#
 That's the Holy Water I was talking about - thank you so much!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$ Rollena ##br#
"Please wait while #br#
I craft a Sage Stone."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Upon hearing this you look at Rollena expectantly.#char$$823$0#

#&7$ Rollena ##br#
"The Sage Stone is very hard to make,#br#
 but the only thing I was missing was the Holy Water.#br#
 I don't know what I would have done without your help!"#br#
 As she speaks, Rollena infuses a stone with the Holy Water, using a technique you have never seen before.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Rollena ##br#
"Wow! This is even better than I expected!#br#
 I expected to use all of this Holy Water, but I've got a Sage Stone with some to spare!" #br#
 Rollena claps her hands in joy.#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Rollena##br#
"I don't really need the rest of this Holy Water.#br#
 Even though there isn't a whole measure left, I'll let you keep it.#br#
 Maybe it'll come in handy in times of need."#br#
 Rollena hands you the Holy Water.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rollena##br#
"Thank you so much,#br#
 brave adventurer!"#npc$$822$1#|

"My sister made some Fried Meatballs this morning#br#
for me to have for lunch.#br#
I was so happy."#M121010h-50$$502$1#

#&7$Norv##br#
"Sadly, I was ambushed by some monsters,#br#
and they stole the Meatballs.#br#
I don't know what to do now."#M121010$$502$1#

#&7$Norv##br#
"My Fried Meatballs..."#M121010$$502$1#|
7303|Are you all right? Is everything okay?|
7304|#&7$Norv##br#
"I was ambushed by some monsters,#br#
 and now I can't move#br#
 because it hurts too much."#M121010h-50$$502$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You start forward to help Norv up,#br#
 but he stops you.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Norv##br#
"That's not important!#br#
 The important thing is that the monsters ran away with my little sister's Fried Meatballs!#br#
 She made them especially for me..."#M121010$$502$1#

#&7$Norv##br#
"I was just sitting here, happily eating my meatballs,#br#
 when a pack of monsters ran up and snatched them from me.#br#
 Can you help get my meatballs back?"#M121010$$502$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You feel sorry about Norv having his farewell present from his sister stolen from him,#br#
 so you nod and agree to help him.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Norv##br#
"You must be someone who understands what it is to love your little sister.
 Make sure that you don't attack the monsters with a blade, because otherwise you'll get blood on the meatballs!#br#
There's a Thick Stick on the ground over there that you can use instead.#br#
 Please, bring my Fried Meatballs back."#M121010$$502$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You look around a find a Thick Stick,#br#
 the perfect weapon for attacking the Raging Otters and getting the Fried Meatballs back intact.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Norv##br#
"Those hideous Raging Otters are lurking around here somewhere.#br#
 Please bring back the 6 Fried Meatballs they stole from me."#M121010$$502$1#

#&7$ Norv##br#
"Sis, I've let you down..."#M121010$$502$1#|
7305|I've retrieved the Fried Meatballs for you.|
7306|#&7$Norv##br#
 "Mmm... that smells so good!#br#
There's only one thing that smells like that,#br#
 and that's my sister's Fried Meatballs!"#M121010h-50$$502$1#

#&7$Norv##br#
"Hmm... there should be six of them.#br#
 Please find all of them before you come back to me."#M121010$$502$1#

What's going on?"#npc$$821$1#|
7308|#&7$Arisa##br#
"My husband hasn't been back since he joined the army,#br#
 and that was months ago..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Arisa##br#
"We swore that we'd be together forever.
#br#
 How could he just abandon me like this?"#npc$$828$1#|
7309|#&7$Jonos##br#
"Honey, where are you?#br#
Why I haven't heard from you for so long?#br#
How am I supposed to live without you?"#br#
The man stares at a picture and sobs.#npc$$829$1#|
7310|Does this Dog Tag look familiar?|
7311|#&7$Stracy##br#
 "Where did you get this Dog Tag?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Stracy##br#
"Turbine Settlement?#br#
 How..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Stracy##br#
"The kid told me he was going to head to Turbine Settlement.#br#
 How could something like this happen?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Stracy##br#
"Something's not right. Adventurers shouldn't have Dog Tags, should they?#br#
 Besides,#br#
 I don't think Dog Tags are supposed to have things like that written on them."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Stracy##br#
"He's probably just having a little trouble finding his way back.#br#
 He'll return soon, I'm sure."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 It seems that this is not the person you are looking for,#br#
 so you leave the woman and continue your search.|
7312|#&7$Arisa##br#
"What did you say?#br#
 Let me see that Dog Tag."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$ Arisa ##br#
"The name at the top has worn off,#br#
 but look at this inscription!#br#
 It's the same as the one we engraved ourselves!#br#
 Look... he even engraved my name all crooked..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Arisa##br#
"But... why?#br#
 We said that we would be together forever...#br#
 Why would he do this to me...?"#br#
 Arisa is so upset that she starts crying.#npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You keep her company #br#
and leave only after she has composed herself.|
7313|#&7$Jonos##br#
 "A Dog Tag?#br#
 What is that?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Jonos##br#
 "You say you found it on a corpse?#br#
 Get that thing away from me!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Jonos ##br#
"Oh, wait!#br#
 Can I see that, please?"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Jonos##br#
"My sweetheart joined the army,#br#
 but he only enlisted a few days ago...#br#
 Besides, we never took any oaths...."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Jonos ##br#
"I'm so jealous!#br#
 I mean, this is certainly sad, but I don't recognize this name.#br#
 Forget about it. I don't even know what I'm talking about..."#npc$$821$1#

everyone needs redemption.#br#
Evil is taking over,#br#

"Lucky for you that you met me!#br#
Without disclosing confidential information, let's just say I know a guy... who knows a guy... who knows another guy...#br#
who works for the church."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Kathy##br#
"I pulled a lot of strings to get a Blessing Wristband from the Grand Bishop himself.#br#
So, the wristband is priceless!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kathy##br#
"Now,#br#
I'm really feeling something between us - something very special!#br#
I'd like to give this wristband to you for free!#br#
Fear no more,#br#
for you are now blessed by the Grand Bishop!"#npc$$824$1#

7315|I'd like to have this Blessing Wristband.|
7316|The Blessing Wristband is a total scam.|

There are dangerous ghosts wandering around.#br#
Steer clear until I have the chance to exorcise them."#npc$$821$1#|

 the Ultimate Robot base unit that I buried.#br#
 I made the flag look like an army banner so no one would suspect anything. Smart, huh?"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Kobe##br#
"So, all you have to do is use the Transformation Parts on the flag at the south gate,#br#
 and the base unit will turn into an Ultimate Robot.#br#
 Easy, no?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kobe##br#
"The base Ultimate Robot does not have the best combat strength,#br#
 so you'll have to boost it using Enhancement Parts.#br#
 Then the most advanced robot in the history of the world will be ready for action!"#npc$$825$1#

"Wow! Looks like someone has found me!#br#
 I've brought a lot top-end equipment with me today. #br#
Would you like to take a look?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Ebazon ##br#
"This spear can pierce anything in the world,#br#

 Which one will it be?"#npc$$821$1#|
7338|Officer Lyla has a favor to ask of you.|

"What does an officer want with me?#br#

 I'd be happy to meet with her."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$ Lyla##br#
"Welcome, merchant.#br#
 I wasn't sure you would come.#br#
 Would you mind looking at my sword?"#br#
Lyla takes out her sword, which is clearly broken.#M123010$Lyla$822$0#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"Oh, so you want me to fix your sword? That's no problem at all!#br#
 Hmm...#br#
I'm sorry to tell you that this sword is as good as scrap. I'm not sure I can fix it.#br#
 How did it get like this?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Lyla##br#
"I don't really know... I was knocked unconscious on the battlefield,#br#
 and when I came to I was the only one left.#br#
 I was still clutching the sword..."#br#
 A look of sorrow sweeps over Lyla's face as she remembers that day.#M123010$Lyla$828$0#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"Now that I think of it, #br#
there might be a way for me to fix it, maybe even make it stronger than it was. #br#
However, the materials I need are very hard to come by..."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$ Ebazon ##br#
"To save this weapon I'll need an Orinoco Root,#br#
 a Sage Stone, World Tree Wood, Sprite Tears, Holy Water,#br#
 a Blessed Strength Scroll, Magical Diamond, Dragon Magic Stone,#br#
 Rainbow Stone, and Vitality Fruit."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lyla##br#
"I've heard of a few of those items before...#br#
 is this going to be an expensive repair?#br#
 I'm willing to pay whatever it costs to have this sword fixed,"#br#
Lyla says, snapping out of her misery.#M123010$Lyla$821$0#

#&7$Ebazon ##br#
"Today's your lucky day!#br#
 I happen to have all of those items,#br#
 except for the Vitality Fruit and Holy Water."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"Unfortunately, both of these things are very hard to get your hands on.#br#
 For someone without a weapon, it'll be practically impossible.#br#
 I certainly can't get them, either."#br#
Ebazon says with a shake of his head.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$ Ebazon ##br#
"Maybe there's a brave warrior around here who would be willing to help you..."#br#
 Ebazon says with a smile, looking directly at you.#npc$$821$1#

and resurrect the ancient beast!"#npc$$821$1#|

 Who would've thought they could reach this scale so quickly?#br#
We must find a way to stop them!"#npc$$828$1#|
7507|#&7$Jessia##br#
 "This is the Eldador beasts' secret armory. #br#
 According to reports from our scouts on the frontlines, #br#
 this is where they're building weapons of astonishing power."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jessia##br#
 "If we let them continue unchallenged, #br#
@we'll be at a great disadvantage on the battlefield. #br#
@We must destroy the armory, and cut their arms supply off at the source!"#npc$$821$1#|
7508|#&7$Jessia##br#
 "Reports mention an Energy Furnace at the core of the armory.#br#
 The furnace is the main energy source powering all the machines you see here.#br#
 Destroying this energy source would help us immensely."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jessia##br#
 "Destroying the Energy Furnace won't be easy, however.#br#
@It's continually fed new energy by five Energy Pillars that surround it.#br#
@These pillars are self-repairing: if you do manage to destroy one,#br#
@it will repair itself in a mere five seconds." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jessia##br#
"The most effective way to take down the Energy Furnace#br#
is for five people to destroy the five Energy Pillars simultaneously.#br#

@We certainly don't have the strength to launch an attack on the enemy."#npc$$821$1#

"But the enemy is suffering heavy losses too, thanks to our army.#br#
We can hold them off for the time being,#br#

7511|I want to hear the story of the Ronin Mushroom.|
7512|#&7$Bodo##br#
"The Ronin Mushroom is the main character of a famous fairytale#br#
 that all children around here know by heart.#br#
 Of course, no one has ever seen the Ronin Mushroom for themselves."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"The story is about a mushroom#br#
 who lived in a forest where all the mushrooms were skinny and had no caps.#br#
 They were always bullied by the other creatures in the forest."#npc$$821$1##&PP01204#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"So, the mushroom embarked on a journey #br#
and trained every day to get stronger.#br#
 He wanted to protect all the other mushrooms in the forest."#npc$$821$1##&PP01204#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"Even though he learned a lot of new fighting techniques, he was not able to make enough progress.#br#
 His weak mushroom body made it very difficult for him to cast spells."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"Things continued like this until he made a new friend.#br#
 One day, he reached an ancient wasteland#br#
 and met a mushroom who had been growing there all alone his whole life."#npc$$821$1##&PP01205#

#&7$Bodo##br#
 Because the soil in the wasteland was so soggy, most ordinary plants couldn't survive there.#br#
 Luckily, this mushroom was shaped like an umbrella and rooted firmly to the ground - #br#
 he didn't have legs, so he couldn't leave."#npc$$821$1##&PP01205#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"The wasteland mushroom was very envious after he heard#br#
 the forest mushroom's description of the wider world."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"In the end, the forest mushroom decided to carry the wasteland mushroom on his back#br#
 so that they could experience the journey together."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Bodo ##br#
"Strange as it sounds, when the two mushrooms were together,#br#
 they could use all the techniques and skills they wanted to with ease.#br#
 The two traveled around fighting evil and helping the weak, and word of their fame spread.#br#
 They came to be known as the 'Ronin Mushroom'."#npc$$821$1##&PP01206#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"In the end, the Ronin Mushroom returned to the forest mushroom's home,#br#
 and they taught the weaker mushrooms there how to fight.#br#
 The mushrooms learned how to defend themselves,#br#
 and no one ever bullied them again."#npc$$821$1##&PP01206#

#&7$Bodo##br#
"It is said that mushrooms have become the way they are now#br#
 because they always strive to be like the Ronin Mushroom."#npc$$824$1#|

#&7$Tod##br#
"As you can see, I'm a biologist.#br#
 I came here to research,#br#
 and I think I've found a special new species."#br#
 Tod strokes a small snail next to him. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tod##br#
"This little fellow is very special.#br#
 I haven't given him a name yet, so for now I'm calling him a Magic Snail.#br#
 If you feed him a little bit of magical material, #br#
he'll go off and lead you to more of the same material."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Tod ##br#
"This magic material is very valuable.#br#
 It can be used to replenish all sorts of energy,#br#
so it would be very useful in terms of helping resupply the army."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tod##br#
"This new energy source is extremely versatile#br#
 and valuable.#br#
 If I could lay my hands on a lot of it,#br#
 I wouldn't need to worry about funding for my research.#br#
 More importantly, I want to see if my hypotheses about the Magic Snail are correct."#npc$$821$1#|

7555|What are you doing here?|
7556|#&7$Lyla##br#
"My troops have been sent here as reinforcements, #br#
but in the last skirmish,#br#
 everyone was lost..."#br#
 Lyla looks off into the distance.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lyla##br#
"When the soldiers reached the designated point, we were ambushed.#br#
 No one survived but me.#br#
 When I regained consciousness, I couldn't remember a thing."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lyla##br#
"It was terrible.#br#
 I was surrounded by bodies.#br#
 Enemies, my men, all dead... I was the only one left...#br#
 This was the sword I was holding."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$ Lyla ##br#
Lyla sadly strokes the sword, and falls silent for a while.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Lyla##br#
"I have nothing left#br#
 apart from this sword.#br#
 It's completely ruined - it's hardly more than a piece of scrap metal now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lyla##br#
"I've heard there is a mysterious merchant who sells only the finest equipment.#br#
 He's rumored to work around here somewhere, so I've come to find him.#br#
 I hope he'll be able to fix my sword.#br#
 It's all I have left..."#npc$$828$1#

 I couldn't possibly ask you#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You put your hand up to show that you really don't mind,#br#
 and wait to hear where Ebazon says you can find them.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"There is a rare item you can find in the Otter Marsh called the Flower of Legend.#br#
 It bears Vitality Fruit,#br#
 which may be very small, but each plant produces a lot of it.#br#
 The fruit is a very versatile material."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"However, there is only a short period of time each year when the flowers blossom and bear fruit.#br#
 I've worked it out, and it should be around now.#br#
 If we miss this chance, you'll have to wait for next year."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Ebazon ##br#
"Holy Water is even harder to get a hold of.#br#
 It comes from Waterweed Wetland,#br#
 but if you don't collect it in a special Alchemy Bottle,#br#
 it's just ordinary lake water."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"Rumor has it there is a well-known alchemist in Smuggler's Cabin.#br#
 Perhaps you can try your luck and go speak to her."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"In total, I will need 1 bottle of Holy Water and...#br#
 999 pieces of Vitality Fruit.#br#
 It's going to be a lot of work!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 When you hear this number, your mouth drops open in shock.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"Don't look at me like that.#br#
 Even though the Flower of Legend only bears fruit for a short period of time,#br#
 it bears a lot of them.#br#
 It won't be hard to collect that many."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"The Flower of Legend grows in the western part of Otter Marsh,#br#
 and you can find the alchemist in Smuggler's Cabin.#br#
 Please bring it all back to me as soon as you can."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Nalia##br#
"It was he who watched silently over us, unafraid of difficulty and danger;#br#
 it was he who selflessly protected us, caring not for fame and glory;#br#
 it was he who was our hero."#npc$$821$1#

 You can't help but feel cheered by the lilting melody,#br#

#&7$Nalia##br#
"Reinhardt used to be our greatest protector,#br#

#&7$Nalia##br#
"The Cube of Gaia opened the pathway to hell,#br#

 everything that was mentioned in the lyrics has happened to you.#char$$823:0$#

You ask your class mentor about Masteries.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Audy##br#
"Ah, Masteries... this is quite a story!#br#
Get ready, you're in for a treat."#br#
Audy clears his throat.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Audy##br#
"Long ago, legendary heroes protected the world with signature weapons they created -#br#
the weapons we know of today. Back then, they were the first of their kind.#br#
As they trained, these heroes refined their strongest weapon techniques, until one day...#br#
An evil force stole these weapons and hid them away in a shrouded place."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Audy##br#
"I suppose this evil thought that if it took the weapons, the Masteries would be lost to time.#br#
But the heroes were not deterred so easily. #br#
They wrote down the secrets to performing their Masteries to be passed down to the next generation.#br#
As a disciple of the Scythe, it is my responsibility to pass down their secret teachings."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Audy##br#
"%p%, I am assuming you wish your friend to be part of that line of legendary heroes, hmm?"#npc$$821$1#

"Patience, young one. You'll learn them when you're ready to learn.#br#
The best way is to acquire Tokens by completing quests.#br#

Gaia Emblems are the greatest invention in the history of Eidolons!#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
The researcher's excitement is infectious,#br#
 and after a moment you nod.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Senior Eidolon Researcher##br#
"Gaia Emblems are magical items containing the power of Gaia.#br#
They can greatly increase your DMG and HP, and have many additional benefits.#br#
 As you get more Eidolons, you can have them undergo star evolution or #br#
use your Emblems and your Eidolon Points will increase accordingly. The higher your Eidolon Points, the more powerful the Gaia Emblems you can use."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Senior Eidolon Researcher##br#
"What do you think? #br#
I bet you'd like to increase the strength of Uzuriel, Kotonoha, and other Eidolons, right?#br#
Or perhaps you could even storm a dungeon and convince Serena to join you...?"#npc$$825$1#

 There are all manner of unusual creatures and strange plants; it really is breathtaking." #br#
 Lauratia turns around and surveys the scene.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$ Lauratia##br#
 "However, it is precisely because it's so beautiful that we need to be careful. Unimaginable danger often lurks in the most innocuous-looking places."#br#
 Lauratia says to you with a serious look. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lauratia##br#
 "If I were to say what this place is known for, it would have to be those frogs over there.#br#
 They may look cute, but they are highly poisonous;#br#
 their neurotoxin can disorient a grown man.#br#
 You need to be particularly wary of their master, the Fragrant Monstrosity."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luratia##br#
 "He emits a heady fragrance from deep within the forest to entice his prey; it is said that his poison has a powerful entrancing effect.#br#
 Escape is impossible once poisoned."#npc$$823$1#

 "Of course, this is all hearsay - no one has actually seen him! Still, if you choose the Fragrant Monstrosity as your next target, be sure to watch your step!"#npc$$825$1#

 "When it comes to the Fish King... well, he's quite a mysterious character!#br#
 I've heard that no one has ever laid eyes upon him,#br#
 and that he silently hides beneath the surface, waiting for his prey."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Nigel##br#
 It's said that when prey approaches, he mimics the sound#br#

"The Team Leader is just so amazing at fencing! Besides that, he's really hot and an all-around nice guy to boot.#br#
I've been able to see him more often ever since I transferred.#br#
Every time we meet, my heart races.#br#
I wonder what he thinks about me..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Velisha##br#
I've heard people say#br#
that if you count flower petals, it helps. I'll give it a go!"#br#
Velisha plucks a flower.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Velisha##br#
He loves me... he loves me not...#br#
he loves me... he loves me not...#br#
he loves me...#br#
he loves me not..."#npc$$821$1#

"That can't be!#br#
I don't believe it. I'm going to try again!"#br#
Velisha sadly plucks another flower.#npc$$828$1#

"Have you by any chance heard of the King's Sword?#br#
It is said that whoever pulls it out of the stone,#br#
will inherit the will of the brave.#br#
Yet, what is meant by the brave?"#npc$$828$1#|
7662|What are you doing here?|
7663|#&7$Waks##br#
"My, my! You're the famous%n%, no?#br#
I'm so delighted to have met you."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
The knight bows before you. You return his bow with one of your own.#char$$822$0#

#&7$Waks##br#
"Recently, something unusual happened.#br#
An invincible demon appeared to the northwest of where the Silverflash Tribe live.#br#
Strange, n'est pas?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Waks##br#
"Legend has it, you see, that there's a sword stuck in a stone,#br#
known as the King's Sword.#br#
That sword is the only weapon that can kill the invincible demon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Waks##br#
"Someone has spotted such a stone with a sword in it#br#
to the south of where the Silverflash Tribe lives.#br#
Perhaps that is the King's Sword..."#npc$$821$1#

"Only the inheritor of the will of the brave#br#
can remove that sword.#br#
I wonder, what is meant by the brave?"#npc$$821$1#

"This... isn't this Collection Box mine?#br#
Siri delightedly recieves the Collection Box.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Siri##br#
"I never thought I'd ever see it again!#br#
Thank you so much." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Siri##br#
However, I'm currently on a mission.#br#
I have to rush off to the rendezvous point#br#
and I don't know when I'll be back here again.#br#
There are people in need who could urgently use that money."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Siri##br#
"Although I'm usually the one who does it,#br#
and this might sound like a strange request,#br#
could I trouble you to do the collections in my place?"#br#
Siri bows to you deeply.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod, showing your willingness to help.#char$$822$0#

#&7$Siri##br#
Wonderful!#br#
We need a total of 800 Gold Coins.#br#
I have a few people in mind#br#
that I'd like you to go see."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Siri##br#
"First, there's the Weapon Merchant Barrington.#br#
But he's a little... strange.#br#
there's also the kind, yet Mysterious Merchant Ebazon.#br#
He's always happy to help others out."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Siri##br#
"Next would be Staff Officer Primanu.#br#
He's usually willing to donate. #br#
Last, but not least is the sweet Divana.#br#
I've heard that she's an artist, but she chose to join the army. Thing is, she's a little afraid of strangers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Siri##br#
"There's four people in total.#br#
I've written their addresses on the list.#br#
You're doing me a huge favor!"#br#
Siri bows once more.#npc$$822$1#|
7668|#&7$Buzz##br#
"Pitching balls is so much fun!#br#
I want to pitch better than anybody else.#br#
I want to become the King of All Pitchers!#npc$$821$1#|
7669|What are you doing here?|
7670|#&7$Buzz##br#
"I'm practicing pitching pretty much every day.#br#
Soon, my throws will be unblockable."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Buzz##br#
"Lately, and I can't fathom why, fewer and fewer people have been joining me for practice."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Buzz##br#
"Did I do something wrong?"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look confused, asking Buzz whether there isn't a war going on.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Buzz##br#
"The war is important, sure.#br#
But sports and leisure are important too!#br#
Also, this counts as training,#br#
so it's not just a frivolous hobby or anything.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Buzz##br#
"Anyway, let's change the subject! I have a few people in mind that I'd like to invite for practice.#br#
Could you go invite them for me?#br#
I want to spend my free time practicing instead.#br#
That's why I can't move from here.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod, saying that helping him out won't be any problem whatsoever.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Buzz##br#
"I have here a list with all the candidates.
All you have to do is go find them.#br#
They all have a great physique,
which is why I'm inviting them.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Buzz##br#
"I'll just keep on practicing.#br#
When you've found the candidates, bring them here.#br#
I'll leave it up to you!#br#
Buzz thanks you breezily."#npc$$822$1#

7671|#&7$Buzz##br#
"This is my list of potential candidates.#br#
Visit the people on it and present them with an invitation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Buzz##br#
"I want to keep on practicing.#br#
Once you've found the candidates, bring them back here.#br#
"I'll leave it up to you!#br#
Buzz politely bows to you.#npc$$822$1#|
7672|I found someone to practice with you.|
7673|#&7$Buzz##br#
"Huh, you haven't found anyone yet! It's too dangerous for you to practice with me.#br#
That's why I need you to help me find suitable people, see?"|
7674|#&7$Kaydy##br#
"*sigh* The war just goes on and on.#br#
If it weren't for those useless soldiers...#br#
how is it that we still haven't won?"#npc$$827$1#|
7675|#&7$Steven##br#
"What to do, what should I do,#br#
if those monsters were to charge in here...#br#
It's terrifying! Ahh... Ahh... Ahhh!"#br#
Steven continues yelling at the top of his voice.#npc$$823$1#|
7676|#&7$%n%##br#
The yeti completely ignores you#br#
and stares into the distance.#npcs50h+99$$821$1#|
7677|#&7$Denila##br#
Magic is just so interesting!#br#
No matter how much you research it, it never gets boring.#br#
I wonder what sort of items will get developed next?"#npc$$821$1#|
7678|Buzz wants you to practice pitching with him.|
7679|#&7$Kaydy##br#
Are you kidding?#br#
Practicing with that lunatic would kill me for sure!"#br#
Kaydy yells at you.#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
What could he be so angry about?#br#
Seems like he's really sick of practicing his pitches.#br#
You'll need to find another person on the list.#char$$821$0#|
7680|#&7$Steven##br#
"No! Don't even mention his name!#br#
Aaahh... Aaahh... Aaah!!!"#br#
Upon hearing you ask, Steven falls into paroxysms of distress.#br#
He squats on the ground, shivering.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You're so surprised that you have no idea what to say.#br#
If he's so scared of praticing his pitches,#br#
you'll need to find another person on the list.#char$$821$0#|
7681|#&7$Yeti##br#
"Mu, mu, mu mumumu ...#br#
mu mumu, mu, mumu...."#npcs50h+99$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
The yeti doesn't look threatening.#br#
However, you can't understand a word he's saying.#br#
You wonder if there could be a way to communicate with him.#char$$821$0#|
7682|#&7$Denila##br#
"You came to ask me about practicing with that boy? We may be powerful with magic, but I'm afraid this old man is in no shape to throw a ball around. Hahaha!"#npc$$821$1#|
7683|Talk to him about the Yeti.|
7684|#&7$Denila##br#
"So what you're asking is that you want to get the Yeti to practice pitching with the boy?#br#
That sounds interesting!#br#
You don't understand the Yeti though, do you?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Denila##br#
"Recently, I invented a translation potion.#br#
My hope was that after drinking it,#br#
the imbiber would be able to speak and understand any language."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Denila##br#
"That said, I'm still not finished with its development.#br#
It's only usable on species closer to humans, like... Yetis.#br#
Here, let me give you a bottle!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Denila##br#
"Use it to talk with the Yeti#br#
and understand what he's saying.#br#
You should note, though, that its effects are time-limited."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You take the translation potion, thanking Denila as you do.#char$$822$0#|
7685|#&7$Denila##br#
"You're saying there are strange creatures in the vicinity?#br#
Well, that really is a strange creature!#br#
I don't know whether a human could ever communicate with it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Denila##br#
"If it weren't for the war continuing to rage,#br#
I'd go with you to see it!"#npc$$821$1#|
7686|#&7$Primanu##br#
"The secret to winning a war is having an infallible battle plan.#br#
With a genius like me as the staff officer,#br#
there's no reason we should lose."#npc$$821$1#|
7687|You look unhappy. What's troubling you?|
7688|#&7$Primanu##br#
"Morale has been so low recently. We need someone to help raise our spirits.#br#
In order for this masterful plan to work, however,#br#
it would have to be someone truly strong.#br#
With the present shortage of people, that's a tricky proposition."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Primanu##br#
"Just a moment! Do my eyes deceive me?!#br#
Is that truly the famous%n%standing before me?"#br#
Primanu rubs his eyes and pinches himself.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You feel a little embarrassed, and look at Primanu while scratching your head.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Primanu##br#
"It hurts! So this isn't a dream after all!#br#
You've come at just the right time.#br#
Can I ask you for a favor?"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look to see if anyone else is around, then nod.#char$$822$0#

#&7$Primanu##br#
"Great! "Now there's no way we can fail!#br#
I have here this magical Banner.#br#
It has to be planted somewhere that can raise the morale of nearby troops.#br#
Can I ask you to plant it next to the impact crater?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Primanu##br#
"There are quite a number of enemies in the area, but they shouldn't be a problem for you!#br#
Are you willing to help?"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You take the Banner and look in the direction of the impact crater.#br#
Having accepted, you decide to complete the task as quick as you can!#char$$824$0#|
7689|#&7$Siri##br#
"If only this world were peaceful!#br#
If only people would trust each other. If only they'd help each other.#br#
Without hate, jealousy, or lies#br#
there wouldn't be any war."#npc$$822$1#|
7690|What are you doing here?|
7691|#&7$Siri##br#
"In war, so many people lose their families and their homes.#br#
I'm collecting donations to help those people. My efforts might not amount to much, but I still believe they'll make some difference.#br#
Until the day our world becomes a utopia, we need to do something!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Siri##br#
"Still, I don't know what happened to my Collection Box.#br#
I must have dropped it somewhere. Perhaps it got dragged off by a strange monster."#npc$$828$1#|
7692|I can't help you collect the 800 Gold Coins. (Collection failed. Collection log cleared)|
7693|#&7$Barrington##br#
"Heh heh.#br#
Look at this cute sapphire.#br#
What a beautiful ruby.#br#
It's gleaming!"#br#
Barrington kisses the sapphire and ruby in his palm.#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Barrington##br#
"That idiot was so easily tricked.#br#
Or rather, isn't it I who's the genius...#br#
...still, I'd better not broadcast what I've done!"#npc$$823$1#|
7694|What are you doing here?|
7695|#&7$Barrington##br#
"The legendary Mysterious Merchant, who only sells rare treasures,#br#
has arrived at the Hurd Military Base.#br#
The whole reason I came to this hole was to buy something from him."#br#
Barrington speaks derisively.#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Barrington##br#
"I've already missed my chance a number of times.#br#
I'm going to buy something from him for sure this time. No matter what.#br#
Thing is, I just went to visit him...#br#
and I couldn't figure out which products were valuable and which were worthless!"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Barrington##br#
"I've heard his goods are consigned by professional treasure hunters.#br#
Some are treasure, others are just trash.#br#
He's too lazy to sort through them all. So no matter their value, he's just laid them out to sell.#br#
It's a travesty. He's just trying to take advantage of me."#npc$$821$1#
@
#&7$Barrington##br#
"Hey! Aren't you the legendary%n%?#br#
I've heard quite a bit about you.#br#
Someone's who's been through so many adventures must know what genuine treasure looks like!#br#
Go buy something from the Mysterious Merchant for me, would you?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod, showing your willingness to help.#char$$828$0#

"Here, take these 999 Gold Coins.#br#
The Mysterious Merchant has set up his stall by the square at the Hurd Military Base.#br#
Find me some real treasure, then bring it back here."#br#
Barrington hands you the Gold Coins.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Barrington##br#
"At the Mysterious Merchant's stall,#br#
there's an antique merchant who claims to be good at spotting fakes.#br#
He charges a high rate for his consultation."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Barrington##br#
"Even so, his methods are worthless.#br#
Whatever you do, don't give him a single coin.#br#

Never mind, it's all good!#br#
They're all treasures!#br#

#&7$Ilanus##br#
Ilanus walks by.#M103010$Ilanus$821$0#

#&7$Ilanus##br#
That might look like the real deal,#br#
but it's but a fake.#br#
Worthless."#M103010$Ilanus$828$0#

#&7$Barrington##br#
"What? What are saying? How did this happen?!#br#
You've used my money to buy garbage. How exactly do you plan to compensate me?"#npc$$827$1#

After hearing that it's a fake, you leave in frustration.#char$$828$0#|
7702|#&7$Ilanus##br#
"What's what's true is false, the false becomes true.#br#
The genuine is often indistinguishable from the counterfeit.#br#
If you consider things objectively, however,#br#
you might just discover the truth."#npc$$822$1#|
7703|I'd like some advice on learning appraisal skills. (This costs 350 of Barrington's Gold Coins)|
7704|#&7$Ilanus##br#
"Who ever thought you'd find such an enthusiastic young buck!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Ilanus##br#
"Appraising treasure isn't so hard, once you've got the knack.#br#
Seeing as you're so keen, I'll teach you how!#br#
Of course, I'll require 350 Gold Coins."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod and pay the 350 Gold Coins.#char$$822$0#

#&7$Ilanus##br#
"Look at things with a cool attitude, from another angle,#br#
and you'll find out their real value.#br#
There is only one truth."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ilanus##br#
"You need to accumulate experience, though.#br#
Learn from your failures.#br#
For a warrior like yourself,#br#
I have a suitable method."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ilanus##br#
"Concentrating on objects#br#
is the same as concentrating on the hostility coming from an enemy.#br#
If the object is valuable,#br#
you will be able to sense the emanation of its will."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Ilanus##br#
"Careful inspection will reap rewards.#br#
I wish you luck!"#br#
Ilanus smiles, while jingling the Gold Coins in his pocket.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look at Ilanus suspiciously, feeling that you've somehow been duped.#char$$828$0#|
7705|#&7$Ilanus##br#
"For an appreciation of many things,#br#
superficial understanding is insufficient. You must experience something deeper.#br#
After careful observation, you'll discover that#br#
there is always only one truth."#npc$$822$1#

*Check whether Barrington has given you the requisite 350 Gold Coins, or whether you've already learned the appraisal skill.|

This is the horn that used to belong to him. The Dragon Horn."#M110020$Ebazon$822$1#

#&7$Ebazon##br#
"Blowing this horn allowed the Dragon Rider to summon his contracted dragon.#br#
It's rather old, however, so I don't know whether it still works.#br#
No one knows what might be summoned, since no one has ever tried."#M110020$Ebazon$821$1#

Still, seeing as you've brought me these weapons,#br#

7741|#&7$%n%##br#
You glance around.#br#
You find a dropped Charcoal Pencil on the ground and pick it up. You then draw on the Sacred Beast Statue to make it look better.#npcs80$$821$1#

You look at the messily marked-up statue with satisfaction.#char$$821$0#|

7744|#&7$%n%##br#
You look around but don't see anything nearby to clean the Sacred Beast Statue with, so you use your own clothes to try and wipe off the graffiti.#char$$821$0#

7849|#&7$Rehia##br#
"I deliberately made it easy for you to find me." #br#
I could've used my invisibility, and then what would you have done?"

7850|#&7$Moe##br#
"That sure is weird. How were we so easily found?#br#
Somebody must've snitched."

7855|Could you tell me that hint again?|
7856|#&7$Zinnia##br#
"Honestly! When a brave man speaks up, you sure as hell should listen.#br#
Listen carefully! I'm only going to say this once more."#br#
Zinnia seems impatient with you.
#npcs70h+85$$1020$1#

#&7$Zinnia##br#
"I know Elder Yeshe, he likes to hide in dark and dank corners like some kind of fungus. #br#
Look for him in places where the sun don't shine, so to speak."
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Zinnia##br#
"Cole is the laziest of them all. He usually hides near stalls. Don't ask why. #br#
There aren't very many stalls in town, so this one should be easy."
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Zinnia##br#
"Rehia hides behind trees, pure and simple. #br#
She thinks she's really clever, but I think she has the mind of a five-year-old."

The orb glows with a strangely colored aura of light. #br#
The orb seems both mysterious and attractive to you. #br#
You feel the urge to stretch out your hand and touch it. #npc$Ancient Spirit$1$1#|
7858|What is this place?|
7859|#&7$Ancient Spirit##br#
"...a long time ago, a miracle occured #br#
when our ancestors built a temple on this site. #br#
This is the birthplace of all Eidolon." #npc$Ancient Spirit$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
The voice echoes in your head, #br#
and seems to assuage your skepticism. #char$$823$0#

#&7$Ancient Spirit##br#
"...only Envoys who have mastered Gaia's Power #br#
possess the ability to pass every trial #br#

7861|#&7$Eidolon Research Institute Director##br#
"I'm afraid we know very little about Gaia's Sanctuary. #br#
We do know one thing, though: #br#
only the mighty Envoys of Gaia may enter."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Eidolon Research Institute Director##br#
"According to one Envoy who attempted to gain entry, #br#
powerful Eidolon reside deep within the Sanctuary. #br#
If you pass this challenge, you obtain the tools to activate the Eidolon Evolution."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Eidolon Research Institute Director##br#
"Moving across the Eidolon Sanctuary consumes vast amounts of energy. #br#
You can only face this challenge once a day. Anything more would be a serious threat to your health. #br#
Dont't worry. You show much promise, and I think you'll pass the trial just fine."#npc$$824$1#|
7862|Okay, so where do I start?|
7863|#&7$Ancient Spirit##br#
"...the answer lies within you. #br#
You must become one with your inner guru." #npc$Ancient Spirit$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
An upbeat tune rings through your head. The singer's voice is rhythmic and soothing. #br#
Somehow, the thought of music brings clarity to your mind.#char$$823$0#

#&7$Ancient Spirit##br#
"...for the duration of a single day, #br#
I can clear the path to your destination #br#
so you may pass freely." #npc$Ancient Spirit$1$1#|

"My husband is traveling abroad in search of a potion to cure our sick daughter. #br#
But he's been gone for a year now and I haven't heard from him since..." #br#
Ayna seems really distressed by the thought.#npc$$1$1#

Of course, as a citywide trainer my time is limited, #br#

7947|#&7$Karol##br#
"You can't have more than one Paper Hook per day. #br#

"I say, this fine weather #br#
is indeed ideal for a fishing excursion..." #br#
Yemi silently contemplates the lake in front of her.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"I don't know if I should go to Crescent Hill to catch a Goldpetal Trout, #br#
or cast a line by the Ventos Prairie to catch me some Rainbow Salmon..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"The Waterfall Catfish in Oblitus Wood is also very tempting. #br#
Then again, it's been so long since I last checked the Emerald Marsh for Bloodthirsty Thornfangs..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"I can't make up my mind..."#npc$$828$1#|
8017|So how do you raise your Fishing Level?|
8018|#&7$Yemi##br#
"You're asking how I practice my fishing skills? #br#
Well, first I look for a peaceful spot in the water, and then... I just wait for the catch. #br#
This can take all day, and that's how I improve. I guess it's a bit like meditation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You stare at Yemi with a mix of confusion and skepticism.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"My apologies. I'm not making myself understood very well. #br#
OK, so first of all, you have to prepare a set of fishing tools. #br#
The quality of the fish you catch is closely tied to your skill level."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"As your Fishing level rises, you can no longer gain XP from lower-quality fish. #br#
At Lv.1 you earn EXP by manually fishing for white-quality fish. #br#
At Lv.2 you earn EXP by fishing for green-quality fish."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"Starting at Lv.3 you should try to catch orange-quality fish. #br#
These orange fish will sustain you up to Lv.8."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"I can tell you're keen to improve your fishing skills as far as possible, #br#
so let me tell you where to find these orange fish. #br#
They inhabit the Mushroom Forest, Emerald Marsh, Starstruck Plateau, and Silent Ice Field. #br#
There are enough orange fish to reach Lv.8."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Yemi##br#
"Once you're at this point, you should make sure to keep a good set of fishing gear on hand. #br#
If you want to reach Lv.10, you'll have to challenge the Fish Kings from each of the four aquatic kingdoms. #br#
There's no minimum level to challenge a Fish King, but beware: they're tough! #br#
The materials they yield are also pretty valuable."#npc$$821$1#

"Let's move up the ranks of Fishing levels together #br#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"I remember seeing these characters somewhere else. #br#
It could have been at the ruins of the Demarech Mines. #br#
But they also look like the characters from those antiques I brought back from the Ruins of Sand..." #br#

 What were you saying?"#npc$$823$1#

You repeat your question for Ishmaela.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"Ah, yes. Ahem. My name is Ishmaela, I am Chair of the Archaeology Association."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"Anglers Anonymous have always had their headquarters in Navea, #br#
but the Archaeology Association never established a head office in Navea. #br#
Vera handles the flow of antiques through Navea for us."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"Things are changing though. We decided to move our headquarters to Navea #br#
and give Vera some more support."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"If you're interested in buying something, #br#
please get in touch with Vera." #br#
Ishmaela falls back into deep thought as she considers her mysterious artifact.#npc$$822$1#|
8022|You collect antiques, isn't that right?|
8023|#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"...say what? Are you a visitor here? #br#
Oh, I'm sorry. I was distracted. #br#
 What were you saying?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You repeat your question for Ishmaela.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"Antiques, eh? #br#
Why yes, I am certainly partial to antiques! #br#
I also study the lost history of ancient ruins. #br#
Honestly, it's a long story..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You wonder if Ishmaela will tell you her story or drift off into deep thought again.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"When I was a little girl, I loved to play around the old ruins. #br#
This one time, I got trapped under a collapsed wall. #br#
No matter how hard I yelled, nobody was around to hear my cries for help. #br#
Then, just as I thought I couldn't hold out any longer, a miracle occurred."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"There was this traveling vagrant #br#
who said he had come to investigate the ruins. #br#
He heard my screams and promptly came to my rescue."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"Later when Lalilu came out to find me, #br#
the man disappeared like a ghost. He was just gone."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"I never found out his real name. #br#
But I learned that he was not a vagrant at all, #br#
he was an archaeologist who had come to inspect the ruins."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"And wouldn't you know, #br#
I went on to study archaeology myself in the hopes of some day finding this man. #br#
I poured my heart and soul into my studies, and the only distraction was my growing collection of antiques."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Ishmaela##br#
"Alas, I never found him. #br#
I can't really say where he is right now..." #br#
Ishmaela sighs and resumes her examination of the artifact.#npc$$828$1#

8025|What's your relationship with Ishmaela?|
8026|#&7$Lulillu##br#
"It's like this: a long time ago, #br#
Ishmaela was under my supervision. #br#
Sometime after that, she went on to establish the Archaeology Association #br#
and appointed me as its executor in Navea."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Lulillu##br#
"Managing the association is a tough business, #br#
so I take care of all the day-to-day stuff. #br#
All Ishmaela needs to do is guide us strategically, #br#
which leaves her with plenty of time to track down her savior..."#npc$$821$1#

Lulillu is amused at the look of confusion on your face.#char$$828$0#

8034|#&7$Robin##br#
"I don't suppose you're interested in hidden treasures, are you? #br#
Make no mistake: archaeology is a tough discipline. #br#
Sometimes you have to venture into ruins infested with dangerous creatures. #br#
It's not uncommon to encounter ancient booby traps, either."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robin##br#
"If you're eager to raise your Archaeology level, #br#
you have to familiarize yourself with the rules of conduct. #br#
Archaeology EXP varies according to the quality of the artifacts you find. #br#
As your Archaeology level rises, you can no longer gain EXP from lower-quality artifacts."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Robin##br#
"If validation fails and the artifact is damaged, #br#
you may still be able to squeeze some EXP out of it #br#
but you won't rise above Lv.3 that way."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robin##br#
"If you want to progress beyond Lv.5, #br#
you'll have get the EXP from artifacts located in #br#
the Mushroom Forest, Emerald Marsh, Starstruck Plateau, and Silent Ice Field."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robin##br#
"You can unlock even more EXP #br#
by validating Fine and Flawless Artifacts. #br#
You gain EXP from the Wisdom of the Ancients in all areas prior to Lv.8."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robin##br#
"With any luck, you might end up validating a Mysterious Treasure Map Fragment #br#
or some gold items, #br#

and can boost you all the way to Lv.10."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robin##br#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"I wonder where my brother is right now...#br#
 I wonder what he thinks about when he's cooking...#br#
 No, I mustn't give up, #br#
 since I need to keep the Club going to help cooks around the world."#npc$$824$1#|
8036|Where is the Culinary Club Chairman?|
8037|#&7$Natalie##br#
Hello and welcome to the Navea Culinary Club!#br#
 I am Natalie, the Vice-Chairman.#br#
 I'm sorry to say we don't have a Chairman right now.#br#
 Rosalinda and I have been filling in. Is there anything I can help you with?"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Natalie why they currently have no Chairman.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Natalie##br#
 "About that... frankly, the position of Chairman has been left for my brother.#br#
 When I was little,#br#
 my older brother left on a journey to become a legendary cook."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
 "He competed in many competitions#br#
 and was getting closer and closer to his goal.#br#
 However, he went missing just before he could take part in the battle of the legendary cooks..."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Rosalinda told me about this.#br#
 She and I set up the Culinary Club afterwards#br#
 to help cooks who wanted to achieve their dreams#br#
 and save them from misfortune."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
 All the same, I wanted to use them#br#
 to find out where my brother could be.#br#
 Still, we haven't heard anything yet.#br#
 I wonder how my brother is doing right now..."#npc$$828$1#|
8038|Was it hard to establish the Culinary Club?|
8039|#&7$Natalie##br#
"It's actually quite fun,#br#
 even if it's also quite tiring."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Though as long as I can see the cooks smiling happily,#br#
 I feel like it's all worthwhile."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Not to mention that Rosalinda is helping out,#br#
 so I learn a lot just by watching her.#br#
Even cute little Aileen helps sell our products.#br#
 Every day is filled with happiness!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Are you interested in cooking?#br#
 If so, please make the most out of what our Culinary Club has to offer.#br#
 If you need to buy anything, please speak with Aileen over there."#npc$$822$1#|
8040|#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Do you like cooking too?#br#
 You can't cook with a flippant attitude.#br#
 You must put all of your feelings into a dish#br#
 in order to bring people happy memories."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Then again, it was someone else who told me that.#br#
 Before, I just treated cooking as a way to make money.#br#
 The person who gave me this insight...#br#
 I wonder where they went after they parted ways with us..."#npc$$828$1#|
8041|Are you the Director of the Culinary Club?|
8042|#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Oh, hi!#br#
 Are you a customer? Can I help you?"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Well... um...#br#
 Hello and welcome to the Navea Culinary Club headquarters.#br#
 I am Rosalinda, the Culinary Club Director."#br#
 Rosalinda seems to have remembered something, and hastily changes around her sentence.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Well... um... is there anything I can help you with?#br#
 I think it's okay to say that...? #br#
 I'm so not used to speaking to people like that..."#br#
Rosalinda lets out a sigh after these bashful words.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"I'm sorry, I'm just not used to it.#br#
 But not that I'm the Director,#br#
  I guess I should learn, right?#br#
 I'm not used to it because it's so strange..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Let me ask Aileen again.#br#
 Wait, perhaps I should say 'consult with Aileen'?#br#
 Aileen is selling products right now, though.#br#
 I wonder if she'll have time to listen to me? What should I do...?"#npc$$828$1#|
8043|What is the Director like on a personal level?|
8044|#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"You're asking me about the Chairman?#br#
 What should I say?#br#
 If I had to describe him,#br#
 I'd have to say he's an idiot."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"He loved cooking#br#
 and loved to see the smiles on#npc$$826$1#

#&7$ people's faces after they tasted his work.#br#
 Strange, isn't he?"$826$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"The Chairman is someone who can proudly say#br#
 that he'll one day become a Legendary Cook.#br#
Natalie told me that when she was little#br#
 her older brother set off on a journey to reach that level."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"I wonder why he would leave Natalie behind...#br#
 I heard she had a strange illness#br#
 that could only be cured by eating a most rare and valuable dish,#br#
 and that this dish could only be prepared by a legendary cook."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"But to leave his sister behind#br#
 and set off on a journey alone...#br#
 Is that the right thing to have done?#br#
 I have no idea..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"When I met the Chairman, I was just a third-rate cook who treated the craft as a way to make money.#br#
 I was proud of my skills,#br#
 but he defeated me in a competition.#br#
 He taught me what cooking is really about."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"After that, I followed the Chairman on his journey#br#
 and we participated in competitions both big and small.#br#
We met a lot of strong opponents and strange judges.#br#
 Although it might have been tough, we persevered through it all."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Then, on the way to the Battle of the Legendary Cooks,#br#
 I got lost and was separated from the Chairman.#br#
When I finally made it to the venue, he had already gone missing.#br#
 I wish I'd never left his side..."#npc$$828$1#
|
8045|So how do you raise your Cooking Level?|
8046|#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Do you also want to become a legendary cook?#br#
 It won't be so easy.#br#
 You don't simply cook according to a recipe,#npc$$826$1#

#&7$ you have to pour your heart into the food."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"You must pour your heart into it#br#
 in order to make a truly good dish.#br#
 Do you have the resolve?"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Cough, cough. Excuse me for being too serious.#br#
 You want to know how cooking ranks work?#br#
 I'll explain a little at a time."#br#
 Rosalinda coughed twice and smiled embarrassedly at you as she speaks.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"You have to prepare cooking tools before you can start.#br#
 You can only cook once you have the appropriate tools.#br#
 The amount of EXP you gain will depend on the level of the cooking performed and the quantity of completed food.#br#
 Once your level is high enough, low-level cooking won't give you any more EXP."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
""Before Lv 3, you can gain EXP from Lv 1-45 cooking.#br#
 Before you reach Lv 6, you can EXP from Lv 60 cooking.#br#
But once you reach that level, you can only gain EXP from cooking levels higher than 60."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
 The higher the quality of the food you make, the more EXP you'll gain.#br#
I suggest you find the right Cooking Tools#br#
 so you can make the highest possible quality.#br#
 That way you'll be more efficient at increasing your level."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosalinda##br#
"Since it's you,#br#
 you might even be able to surpass the Chairman...#br#
 When you become a legendary cook, I wonder if the Chairman will return..."#npc$$828$1#

"Oh my, the weather is perfect for some outdoor gathering! #br#
But where should I go? #br#
I could go to the Demarech Mines to dig for Miracle Stones, #br#
or I could venture out to Candeo Marsh in search of rare Waterweeds..."#npc$$821$1#|
8054|Are you the Director of the Collectors Club?|
8055|#&7$Ainisus##br#
"Are you asking if I'm the Chairman?#br#
 Why, of course! Amazing, no!?#br#
Although I prefer to be called an Adventurer...#br#
 I wonder where I should explore today?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Chairman, these are the documents you need to have processed by noon today.#br#
 Can you please take a look at them?"#br#
Ouranus walks towards you with a pile of documents in her arms.#M004050$Ouranus$822$0#

#&7$Ainisus##br#
"Ouranus, what perfect timing!#br#
 I'm wondering where I should go later on.#br#
 Help me think about it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Hmm... you want to leave?#br#
 I think you should process these documents before you do,#br#
 don't you?"#br#
 A smile beams on her face.#M004050$Ouranus$825$0#

#&7$Ainisus##br#
"Well, can't you do that for me?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Perhaps... not!#br#
 These all need you personal signature!"#M004050$Ouranus$822$0#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Oh, yes! While I'm here,#br#
 about the get-together at lunch,#br#
 you haven't forgotten, have you? It's very... important get-together."#br#
 Ouranus smiles impishly.#M004050$Ouranus$827$0#

#&7$Ainisus##br#
"I... I want to leave.#br#
 Somebody help me..."#br#
 said Ainisus powerlessly, his head turned towards the ground.#npc$$828$1#|
8056|What is the Collectors Club?|
8057|#&7$Ainisus##br#
"Are you interested in nature? #br#
 Because I just love nature."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Ainisus##br#
"That's why I teamed up with suppliers from different regions #br#
to establish the Collectors Club,#br#
 an association representing the interests
 of hunters and gatherers everywhere."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ainisus##br#
Well, okay... actually, the idea came from Ouranus and Garret,#br#
 who went to negotiate with the merchants..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ainisus##br#
"But the end result is that #br#
 I've got access to all kinds of new resources,#br#
 and we've been supporting a lot collectors.#br#
 Everyone wins!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Chairman, you're still chatting?#br#
 Why haven't you signed those documents yet?"#M004050$Ainisus$827$0#

#&7$##br#
"I've got zero patience for paperwork..."#br#
 Ainisus looks miserable as he signs the documents before him.#npc$$828$1#|
8058|#&7$Ouranus##br#
Hello and welcome to the Navea Collectors Club.#br#
 I'm Ouranus, the Club's Director."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"After the Club was established,#br#
 we focused on connecting roads together#br#
 to prevent merchants from teaming up and monopolizing the market.#br#
 We've also provided collectors with a great deal of support."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Please speak to Garret next to you#br#
 if you want to buy anything."#npc$$821$1#|
8059|What's your relationship with Ainisus?|
8060|#&7$Ouranus##br#
"I've known Ainisus for over 10 years now.#br#
 We're what you might call childhood friends."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Ainisus has been a lover of nature since he was little.#br#
 He loved to go on adventures#br#
 and loved all sorts of strange plants and minerals even more."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"That said, he always made trouble for Garret and I.#br#
 When we weren't getting lose in the forest,#br#
 we were being chased by wild animals.#br#
 His love has caused us so many headaches."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Although he says he'd prefer to be an adventurer,#br#
 a difficult position like that of a Chairman#br#
 could only be assumed by someone as passionate about nature as him!"#br#
 Ouranus speaks with a proud smile.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"It'd be better if he'd act like an adult, though..."#npc$$827$1#
|
8061|Why did you feel the need for a Collectors Club in the first place?|
8062|#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Since the establishment of Anglers Anonymous,#br#
 I'd been thinking of setting up a similar association for collectors."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"After discussing it with Garret,#br#
 we decided to come up with our own sort of Collectors Club,#br#
 and Ainisus the chairman, since he's loved nature from childhood."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Although it was hardly easy,#br#
 Garret and I put in a lot of hard work to ensure the Club's success.#br#
 It didn't go too well at first,#br#
 and we ran into a lot of trouble as a result.#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"Then one day, Garret and I had the opportunity to speak with a merchant#br#
 and finally managed to set up our Collector's Club.#br#
 However, that was just the beginning,#br#
 as managing and maintaining the Club is the hard part."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ouranus##br#
"If you're interested in collecting,#br#
 please make the most of what our Collector's Club has to offer.#br#
 If you want to look at our wares, please speak to Garret, who's next to you."#npc$$822$1#|
8063|#&7$Garret##br#

 Our association provides Collectors with support items.#br#
 How can I help you?"#npc$$822$1#|
8064|Do you have any Collector Tokens?|

"The air around us is full of spiritual energy. #br#
Over time, #br#
this energy crystalizes around certain plants and minerals. 
The fragments thus formed are called Ethereal Crystals."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Garret##br#
"I don't know exactly what purpose these crysals serve. #br#
Our researchers are still looking into that. #br#
As a result, we have plenty of samples lying around.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Garret##br#

I'll buy it from you. #br#
I'll exchange them for Collector Tokens, which you can use in turn to buy our goods."#npc$$821$1#|

8165|So how do you raise your Collecting Level?|
8167|So how do you raise your Cooking Level?|
8168|#&7$Natalie##br#
"Cooking is fun!#br#
 It isn't easy,#br#
 but once you learn how,#br#
 I believe you'll get good at it very quickly."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"To increase your level, you must equip the right cooking tools.#br#
 You can buy tools from merchants all over the land, or from Aileen right here.#br#
 There are three types of cooking tools, each for different types of cooking.#br#
 Respectively, these are the finesse-type, speed-type, and complex-type.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
 "With finesse-type cooking, the chance of ingredients appearing at the same time is pretty low, so there's a high rate of failure.#br#
 With speed-type cooking, the ingredients move quickly, so you'll need to react quickly too.#br#
 With complex-type cooking, it's very easy to get the ingredients wrong, so you'll need to move fast.#br#
 Cooking Tools are matched with the above three types of cooking in order to increase the chance of success."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"However, as your cooking level gets higher and you become more comfortable with handling the process,#br#
 you can use special tools.#br#
 Though they have lower attributes than the three main types, you cook more portions of food with the same amount of ingredients,#br#
 so it's easier to make higher-quality products. Try it out sometime."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Once you have a cooking tool, you'll need to prepare the ingredients.#br#
 Ingredients can be collected from all over the map,#br#
 or you can buy them from other people.#br#
 You can start cooking once you have all the ingredients."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"To cook, right-click the ingredients.#br#
 This will open up the Cooking Interface.#br#
 If you select Manual Cooking, you'll be able to play the cooking mini-game."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"There's a five-second countdown before the mini-game begins.#br#
 Hints about wrong ingredients will be displayed during the countdown.#br#
 Once the game starts, ingredients will appear from the right and move towards the left.#br#
 You'll also see a countdown timer displaying the amount of remaining time.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"During the cooking process#br#
 you'll gain points, and ingredients will disappear when they move above the pot on the left.#br#
 You'll gain points for correct ingredients and lose points for wrong ones,#br#
 which is why you need to left-click on wrong ingredients to get rid of them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#

"Cooking is fun!#br#
 It isn't easy,#br#
 but once you have the right tools,#br#
 I'm sure your results will be twice as good."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"To increase your level, you must equip the right cooking tools.#br#
 You can buy tools from merchants all over the land, or from Aileen right here.#br#
 There are three types of cooking tools, each for different types of cooking.#br#
 Respectively, these are the finesse-type, speed-type, and complex-type.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"Cooking Tools have four abilities in total.#br#
 These are to decrease the speed of ingredients, increase the rate at which ingredients appear,#br#
 increase the quantity of appropriate ingredients, and increase the points earned."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"The greater the reduction of ingredient speed,#br#
 the slower ingredients move.#br#
 This is very useful for speed-type cooking."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"the more ingredients that appear,#br#
 the higher the chance is that ingredients will appear at the same time.#br#
 This is useful for finesse-type cooking.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"The more appropriate ingredients that appear,#br#
 the higher the chance of having correct ingredients appear.#br#
 This is especially useful for complex-type cooking."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"The fourth ability, to increase points earned, is a special one only pros should use.#br#
 With the increased score bonus, you'll get more points for correct ingredients.#br#
 It's useful for all kinds of cooking, but special tools are weaker in the other three aspects."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalie##br#
"When you're finding cooking difficult,#br#
 try using a different tool.#br#
 Maybe it'll be easier!"#npc$$822$1#|

We have received word that a wicked force has appeared in the Star Sand Desert, and that you faced this threat with all of your power. Other than giving our thanks and a reward for saving Midgard once again, there is nothing else I can do.

The appearance of the Lavalord was not by chance. The Church has sent people to investigate this matter and I believe we may soon need your power again. I hope you remain vigilant.

8182|#&7$Simone##br#
"In a card battle, both sides have 5 cards.#br#
Once the battle begins, both players display their cards,#br#
 and the cards use their normal attacks on each other."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"A Card Deck's attribute affects the outcome of the battle.#br#
 Lightning counteracts ice, ice counteracts flame, flame counteracts wind,#npc$$1$1#

#&7$ wind counteracts lightning, and light counteracts dark. The attributes affect each other in this way."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Cards also have their own special abilities.#br#
 Using one at the right moment can turn a battle around."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"The cards on the table are like a defensive wall.#br#
When an enemy's card in a certain position is destroyed,#br#
 your cards will directly attack the enemy#br#
and reduce their HP."#npc$$821$1#

"Destroyed cards regenerate after a while#br#
 and will continue to battle!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"The battle continues until either player's HP reaches zero.#br#
 The last person standing is the victor."#npc$$1$1#|
8183|How do I get cards?|

 Start a Card Battle with anyone all over the land#br#

 The sweet aroma of baked biscuits fills the air around you.#npc$$822$1#|

"Why... why am I the only one who was sent outside the city..."#br#
 Midas, who is responsible for doing inventory of supplies, is checking through items by himself outside.#npc$$822$1#|

"To create a wonderful, festive atmosphere, you need fireworks that dazzle, don't you think?"#br#
Elliot seems excited.#npc$$825$1#|
8195|#&7$Leesh##br#
"These cute foxes are just waiting for you to bring them home.#br#
 They're only available during the carnival!"#br#
 Leesh shouts at the crowds of people gathered around her to look at the foxes.#npc$$822$1#|

"Cough, cough... I also want to go to the carnival..."#br#
 The sickly little girl looks to be in a bad mood.#npc$$822$1#|

"Do you want to hear a legend about Navea?#br#
 It's a legend that sings praises to the Sky Tower."#br#
 The Traveling Bard sings.#npc$$822$1#|
8198|What events will be held during the carnival?|
8199|#&7$Wurst##br#
"Why, a lot, of course! The most special one is the float parade!#br#
 The Eidolons appear on floats to greet everyone.#br#
 We don't normally get to see the Eidolons... I can't believe we'll finally be able to during the carnival!#br#
 Oh, sorry... I'm a bit too excited!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wurst##br#
"This time we've invited a representative from the Firework Village to provide us with fireworks,#br#
 but seeing as this year's carnival has a larger scale that in the past, maybe the representative will need some assistance?#br#
 Of course, fireworks are very important for heating up the atmosphere at a carnival!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wurst##br#
"I've also heard the famous Beast Tamer will be here this year!#br#
If I remember correctly... the Beast Tamer arrived with some cute fox cubs.#br#
 Are you interested? If you haven't had a pet before, a fox would be a good choice."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wurst##br#
"Oh! I almost forgot to tell you...#br#
 During these events, you can obtain Carnival Coins.#br#
 These coins can be used for many things. Ask Ellen over there about it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wurst##br#
"While I'm at it... our supply team ordered some biscuits from Lunarin.#br#
 We originally wanted to give them Adventurers as a gift,#br#
 but it feels like it isn't going well... maybe it's time we checked up on it..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Wurst##br#
"Well, I'm just rambling,#br#
 but I still want you to enjoy the Carnival!"#npc$$822$1#|
8200|The carnival's supply team?|
8201|#&7$Wurst##br#
"We used to the Navea Security Squad, but they made us the supply team for the Carnival!#br#
 Ellen is responsible for coordinating everything, while I'm in charge of security.#br#
 If you have any questions, you can ask me too!"#npc$$822$1#|
8202|Ellen is really fierce...|
8203|#&7$Wurst##br#
"Hahaha... still, she is very capable. That's why I'm following her around, it's great!#br#
 Ellen is normally very kind! She's probably like this because she's under so much stress.#br#
 So come to me if there's anything I can help you with!"#npc$$821$1#|
8204|I want to exchange 10 Carnival Coins for 1 Gift Pack|
8205|I want to exchange 25 Carnival Coins for 3 Gift Packs|
8206|#&7$Ellen##br#
"What?! That's not enough!"#npc$$826$1#|
8207|How can I get Carnival Coins?|
8208|#&7$Ellen##br#
"You can join in activities or help people... there are a lot of ways to get them!#br#
 You can also ask Wurst about the various activities. Also, there's another special way you can get them..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ellen##br#
"That is, completing Instances."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Instances? Driven by your suspicions, you almost open your mouth to ask about it,#br#
 but when your eyes met with Ellen's,#br#
 their resolute look makes you wonder if she's keeping some important secret,#br#
 and you decide to wait till Ellen finishes talking before asking someone else about the reason for this.#char$$823$0#

#&7$Ellen##br#
"You can get Carnival Coins by defeating demonic creatures in 5 player, Pandemonium Mode, or Otherworld Instances.#br#
I've also heard that people have found Carnival Coins in the Abyss and the Otherworld...#br#
|
8209|Why would monsters have Carnival Coins?|
8210|#&7$Ellen##br#
"What? Didn't I tell you this already? So troublesome..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Ellen##br#
"We ordered a large batch of cakes earlier#br#
 since we wanted to give them to Adventurers like you,#br#
 and there'd be Carnival Coins hidden inside!#br#
 Well, that's what we were planning!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ellen##br#
"Instead, the cakes were stolen by demonic creatures when they were being transported...#br#
It was just one cart at first, but then they were all taken... What a pain! Those accursed demons!#br#
 The cakes must have been so delicious, huh? Huh?"#br#
 Ellen stomps her feet.#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Ellen##br#
"Really though, the cakes being eaten wasn't that big of a deal.#br#
 The problem is the Carnival Coins that were in the cakes...#br#
 That's why we're asking you adventurers to help recover them.#br#
 Get it now?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ellen##br#
"Those Carnival Coins were for participants to use to redeem Gift Packs.#br#
 I never thought it would turn out like this....#br#
 Sigh... anyway, it still works the same. Collect the Carnival Coins and exchange them for Gift Packs! The Gift Packs are equal to the Carnival Coins!
 Get it? If you do, then get a move on!"#br#
|
8211|Why are you all alone?|
8212|#&7$Midas##br#
"That's a very good question... Why is that?"#br#
 Midas looks at you with a vexed expression.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Midas##br#
"Ah! I remember now. It's probably because I had the bad luck to be chosen for duty outside the city.#br#
 Everyone else is enjoying the Carnival and I'm alone out here sorting these biscuits... Hmph!"#br#
Midas speaks so passively and coldly that even you can feel his grudge...#npc$$822$1#|
8213|I want to trade for a Magical Cloth Bag.|
8214|#&7$Leesh##br#
Sure! This is a Magical Cloth Bag. I hope you can catch the pet you're after with it!"#br#
Leesh takes a cloth bag from her bag and gives it to you.#npc$$822$1#|
8215|#&7$Leesh##br#
"No... that's not right! You've already gotten one... A person can only get one for free each day!"#br#
 Leesh explains the situation resolutely, but looks like she is afraid of making you angry.#npc$$829$1#|
8216|I want to exchange 5 Carnival Coins for 1 Magical Cloth Bag|
8217|#&7$Leesh##br#
Sure! This is a Magical Cloth Bag. I hope you can catch the fox you're after with it!"#npc$$822$1#|
8218|How do I use the Magical Cloth Bag?|
8219|#&7$Leesh##br#
"Haha, you just have to cross this fence and find a fox puppet that you like,#br#
 then capture it with the bag!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Leesh##br#
"These fox puppets are made with a special magic,#br#
 so you can only capture them with this Magical Cloth Bag!#br#
 Heehee, after you capture it, open the zip on its back to find out what you've caught!"#br#
@Leesh laughs happily and speaks as though she's showing off.#npc$$821$1#|
8220|What's wrong?|
8221|#&7$Girl##br#
"I-I'm sick, so I can't participate in the Carnival..."#br#
 The little girl lifts her head to look at you. She looks unwell.#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You feel sorry for her.#br#
 You think about how you could help her.#char$$828$0#|
8222|I'll give you this Picture Book.|
8223|#&7$Girl##br#
"This is... a Picture Book?"#br#
 You give the little girl the Picture Book you got from the Traveling Bard.#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You describe the contents of the Picture Book simply,#br#
@and integrate your experiences of the Carnival into your description.#br#
 After some time, you manage tell the little girl a wonderful story.#char$$823$0#

"Thank you! I feel like I got to take part in the Carnival too! This is for you..."#br#
@She fishes out some Carnival Coins from her pocket.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Girl##br#
"I'll treasure this Picture Book forever!"#br#
 The little girl laughs happily and you think she looks healthier than when you first saw her.#npc$$822$1#|
8224|What are you doing here?|
8225|#&7$Traveling Bard##br#
"I've traveled everywhere and turned my experiences into marvelous songs.#br#
 I also want to record these fantastic Carnival days!#br#
 The Traveling Bard explains this to you.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod and think that you've never seen anyone like him.#br#
You can't help but ask him about whether his songs won't be passed down if no one else sings them..#char$$821$0#

#&7$Traveling Bard##br#
"Of course I've thought about that! To keep these stories alive forever,#br#
 I record them into books and add my own artwork..."#br#
 The Traveling Bard takes out a beautiful Picture Book from his bag. The book is illustrated with exquisite drawings.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You flip through the book and see the events of the Carnival,#br#
 drawings of delicate floats, cakes and biscuits... and even a drawing that looks like you.#char$$806$0#

8226|Can I have this Picture Book?|
8227|#&7$Traveling Bard##br#
"Oh, no! This is one of my masterpieces! How could I give it to someone so easily?"#br#

 and how you think the Picture Book will cheer her up.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Traveling Bard##br#
"Oh... what a poor little girl. If that's the case..."#br#
The Bard quickly changes his tune and stuffs the book into your hands.#npc$$825$1#

"This thing! I can write and draw it again, but the little girl has only one life!#br#
@Don't trick me. I'm giving you my lifeblood!"#npc$$824$1#|

"I like you a lot; don't let me down. The boss wants to discuss something with me, so go ahead and meet with the Chief's Wife."#M121010$Willie$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are not sure why or when you fell asleep. Yesterday, you agreed to deliver some merchandise to the Chief's Wife. It looks as though you've missed the delivery; you have to apologize to her.##char$$821$0#|
10042|#&7$Sheila##br#
"It is now getting late. %n%, this boy is so..."#npc$$821$1#|
10043|#&7$Sheila##br#
"%n%, have you forgotten your promise already?"#br##br#
#&53$Sheila asks with a gentle smile.##npc$$821$1#|
10044|Several nights of nightmares have deprived you of proper sleep. You feel sluggish, as though you are in a constant fog. Yesterday, you completely forgot to help deliver goods, so you'll need to apologize to the Village Chief's wife.

Talk with Sheila, the Village Chief's wife.|
10051|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You apologize to Sheila and ask if there is a way to make it up to her.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"Your apology is quite sincere. I forgive you. And I do have another task,"#br##br#
#&53$Sheila says with a kind smile.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"These boxes of jam just arrived from the port. Please help me deliver them to the merchants in the village."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sheila##br#
#&53$Sheila gives a frown only an irritated mother can give.##br##br#
"Also, ask them if they have seen my son, Joel. I have no idea where he is."#npc$$821$1#|
10052|#&7$Sheila##br#
"I've heard of rebellions, but Joel has gone too far. It's late, and he hasn't come home yet. I fear he's getting spoiled, and we can't have that! He needs to learn a lesson."#npc$$821$1#|
10053|#&7$Sheila##br#
"Have you delivered the jam? You've truly grown; it's time for you to start saving your money."#br##br#
#&53$Sheila places some gleaming coins in your palm and closes your fingers around them.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"Did any of the merchants see Joel?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shake your head and tell her that none of the merchants have seen him today. Hearing this, Sheila's irritation starts to turn to worry.##char$$821$0#|
10054|Sheila forgives you for being late and asks you to bring boxes of jam to the merchants in the village. She also wants you to see if any of the merchants know where her son Joel is.

Bring the jam to Anita, Corey, and Betsy.|
10055|#&7$Anita##br#
"This is so unusual. So you're helping Lady Sheila deliver goods today? I suppose you are indeed a real garrison member. Keep up the good work."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anita##br#
"From now on, everyone will treat you as an adult. Perhaps you'll travel the world, meeting maharajas and princesses. Or maybe you'll just live and work in this fishing port all your life. You know, either way."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anita##br#
"Just remember this: in the outside world, you can buy different potions at various drugstores. You might find some other special items there, too."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Anita if she has seen Joel.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anita##br#
"Joel didn't come to the marketplace today. It's a bit odd; he usually stops by."#npc$$821$1#|
10056|#&7$Corey##br#
"Jam! At last! My toast has been going naked!"#br##br#
#&53$Corey pops open the jar, dips in his fingers, and slurps up the jelly eagerly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Corey##br#
"Mmm! Anita was right. The jam is perfectly sweet and tart. Would you like some? I promise my fingers are clean."#br##br#
#&53$Corey follows your gaze to the newly produced weapons.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Corey##br#
"Impressive, right? These weapons all came from abroad! This one here, for instance, is the Battle Axe, a symbol of strength. And over there is the Staff, a symbol of intelligence."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Corey##br#
"I'll give you a tip, jelly kid. When you have time, just visit weapon shops in different places. You might find exceptionally good weaponry at reasonable prices!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Corey if he has seen Joel.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Corey##br#
"Joel? No, I haven't seen him today."#npc$$821$1#|
10057|#&7$Betsy##br#
"%n%, would you like to buy a piece of Beast Tusk Light Armor? We carry the armor in all sizes, and we... what is this?"#br##br#
#&53$Betsy takes the jar of jam and examines it suspiciously.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Betsy##br#
"Wait, I clearly told Anita that I don't want any jam. It's too sweet. I like my jam salty and sour!"#br##br#
#&53$Betsy huffs.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Betsy##br#
"Well, let's forget about the jam. Why don't you treat yourself to some new armor? Being a garrison member in a fishing village is not exactly a dangerous job, but from time to time, you'll need to clear out some monsters, and you'll be happy to have steel between their claws and your heart!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Betsy if she has seen Joel.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Betsy##br#
"I saw him yesterday, but not today."#npc$$821$1#|
10061|#&7$Sheila##br#
"Hasn't anyone seen Joel? Where has that boy gone?"#br##br#
#&53$Sheila glances around anxiously.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"He can't have gone too far..."#br##br#
#&53$She hangs her head, looking despondently at the lunchbox in her hand.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"I ought to go look for him. Could you bring this lunchbox to my husband, York? When you see him, ask him to find you a suitable job."#npc$$821$1#|
10062|#&7$York##br#
#&53$York frowns, pacing anxiously as he chats with Warren, the lighthouse manager.##npc$$821$1#|
10063|#&7$Warren##br#
"I must report to you, as you are the Village Chief. The sea has begun to churn; the situation grows more unstable by the day. I can only guide the ships into the port with light signals, but..."#M116010$Warren$821$0#

#&7$York##br#
"Got it. The monster population in the forest has skyrocketed, too. Things are getting rough around here."#br##br#
#&53$York looks over at you, eyeing the lunchbox.##M005010$York$1$1#

#&7$York##br#
"%n%, where is my wife, and why are you delivering my lunch?"#char$$1$0#|
10064|Sheila grows anxious about her son and decides to go looking for him. She asks you to bring the lunchbox to her husband, York, and tells you to ask York for a suitable job.

Bring the lunchbox to York near the lighthouse.|
10071|#&7$York##br#
"Sheila dotes on him. She spoils him. He can play alone once in a while, you know? Who knows, he might grow up to be a great conqueror - if he stops being so darn soft!"#br##br#
#&53$York chortles.##M005010$York$824$1#

#&7$York##br#
"As for your work... well, I really don't have much for you to do."#M005010$York$821$1#

#&7$Warren##br#
"York, you said you needed someone to replace one of Caine's... less enthusiastic workers. How could you forget so quickly?"#M116010$Warren$821$0#

#&7$York##br#
"I didn't forget. But working for Caine is no picnic. Very few are willing to work backbreaking hours at the Logging Site, and Caine's not exactly Mr. Personality."#M005010$York$821$1#

#&7$York##br#
"%n%, would you like to try working at the Logging Site? The salary's not bad."#M005010$York$821$1#|
10072|#&7$Caine##br#
"This boy Brian is a fool! He only makes work harder for me! Unless we're short workers, I'd fire him right away!"#br#
#&53$Caine grumbles to himself. It seems that working at the Logging Site is quite arduous.##npc$$826$1#|
10073|#&7$Caine##br#
"Did York ask you to come here? Excellent. I was just wondering what the Garrison Members in the village normally do during the day. They just hang about the forest. They might as well be here doing something productive for once." #npc$$821$1#


#&7$Caine##br#
"Speaking of which, have you seen Brian lately? He hasn't come to work in days!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shake your head and explain that you don't know him.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caine##br#
"Well, there's no time to lose. You should just start working right away."#npc$$821$1#|
10074|York doesn't have a job for you with him, so he sends you to the Logging Site.

Talk with Caine, the foreman at the Logging Site.|
10081|#&7$Caine##br#
"Lately, numerous Bunnyhops have migrated to the Logging Site. The naughty troublemakers make a mess all day long. Workmen complain constantly about picking up their, er, 'jelly beans.'"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"We cannot let those rascally rabbits slow us down. If the wood is not delivered to the village fast enough, construction there will be delayed."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"I've a task for you. Drive the Bunnyhops and Mischievous Bunnyhops out of the Logging Site so the lumberjacks can focus on their work!"#npc$$821$1#|
10082|#&7$Caine##br#
"We have three days to deliver to the furniture shop. We cannot be late."#br#
#&53$Caine snaps, scanning a list.##npc$$821$1#|
10083|#&7$Caine##br#
"Not bad for a newbie."#br##br#
#&53$Caine is clearly satisfied by the reduced number of Bunnyhops.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"This was originally Brian's job, but I think you ought to take his place. You're more responsible than he ever was. Go to the Garrison Captain. I will speak to him."#npc$$821$1#|
10084|Caine asks you to drive out the Bunnyhops disturbing the workmen, as they are delaying the supply of wood to the town.

Get rid of the naughty Bunnyhops and Mischievous Bunnyhops near the Logging Site.|
10091|#&7$Caine##br#
"It's about time to send the chopped wood back to the village,"#br#
#&53$Caine explains, scanning the sky.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"You must help me finish off today's work if you want your proper salary."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"You'll find a good deal of wood in the area. I need you to carry it to me."#npc$$821$1#|
10092|#&7$Caine##br#
"Lumberjacks typically pile up the chopped wood under another tree. Take a walk around the Logging Site. It shouldn't be hard to find the wood."#npc$$821$1#|
10093|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You pass the collected lumber to Caine.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caine##br#
"You move pretty fast. What about the others?"#npc$$821$1#|
10094|Caine asks you to gather the chopped wood around the Logging Site.

Gather the wood in the Logging Site, then return to him.|
10101|#&7$Caine##br#
"What are those workmen doing now? It's late, and they haven't brought the wood back yet."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"%n%, everyone says I'm too harsh. I suppose you can judge for yourself now. Only you have returned with the wood. What are all the others doing out there, picking each other's noses?"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"Take this hammer and search the site for anyone sleeping on the job. Give 'em a wake up call they won't forget!"#br#
#&53$Cairne snarls, his face flushed with fury.##npc$$826$1#|
10102|#&7$Caine##br#
"These lazy fools are becoming more and more arrogant. It's time they take a pay cut! I doubt they'll dare slack off on the job again."|
10103|#&7$Caine##br#
"See for yourself. %n%, who started working here just today, has contributed more to our project in one day than you have in your career. Shame on you!"#M110020$Caine$826$1#

#&7$Lumberjack##br#
"I was just taking a break. I didn't know I was going to fall asleep. It's not a big deal."#M102010$Lumberjack$821$0#

#&7$Caine##br#
"Not much of an excuse, you lazy fool! You only get half a day's pay today. End of discussion!" #M110020$Caine$826$1#

#&7$Lumberjack##br#
"You're such a scrooge! Everyone needs a nap now and again!"#M102010$Lumberjack$821$0#

#&7$Caine##br#
"If you argue again, I'll take away your breaks,"#br##br#
#&53$Caine growls, glaring.##M110020$Caine$821$1#

#&7$Lumberjack##br#
"Fine, fine. I know I made a mistake. I won't do it again." #M102010$Lumberjack$828$0#|
10104|Caine realizes that the lumberjacks should be returning with wood, but you are the only one who actually finishes the task. He hands you a hammer, the symbol of a foreman, and tells you to seek out the idle workers and give them a wake-up call.

Use Caine's hammer to drive home a lesson for those lazy lumberjacks.|
10111|#&7$Caine##br#
"%n%, you've impressed me. You're destined for greatness. However, maybe being a Garrison Member isn't the best use of your skills."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Caine##br#
"Thus, I'll recommend you to Doctor Cal. You can work for him. It's easier than working at the Logging Site, and you'll make more money."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nervously explain to Caine that you know nothing about medicine, and you don't want to be a burden to the doctor.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caine##br#
"Oh, c'mon. It can't be that hard! You only go to school for, what, eleven, twelve years to become a doctor? No biggie. Just look at it as a learning experience."#npc$$821$1#|
10112|#&7$Cal##br#
"Haha, each of those lazy lumberjacks comes to me with the same complaints. Seems like this Caine guy is pretty strict."#npc$$821$1#|
10113|#&7$Cal##br#
"Are you awake now? How do you feel?"#br##br#
#&53$Cal smiles at you, his face is lighting up.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You throw Cal a suspicious look. You have no idea what happened to you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"Caine sent you to me. He said while he was talking with you, you suddenly fainted. He was so startled he almost jumped out of his skin! Haha!"#br##br#
#&53$Cal chuckles as he gives you a once over.##npc$$825$1#|
10114|Caine finds your work ethic praiseworthy and recommends that you go help Doctor Cal.

Talk with Village Doctor Cal.|
10121|#&7$Cal##br#
"At the moment, I can't find any physical problems. Maybe you're overworked; that can affect your brain, you know. You've got the same symptoms as the other workmen."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You consider his reasoning, but it doesn't quite make sense. You explain to Cal that perhaps your continuous nightmares have kept you from getting a proper night's sleep.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"I heard Caine sent you here to help out. Luckily, I've got the perfect project for you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"This should be a simple task for someone like you. Here, take this; it'll get your blood flowing."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"You and the other lumberjacks need something - some sort of medicine to refresh your minds and bodies. Something to put some pep back in your step."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"I need you to prepare some antelope blood for me. You can find Floppy-Eared Antelope nearby."#npc$$821$1#|
10122|#&7$Cal##br#
"You need blood from Floppy-Eared Antelopes to make the refreshing medicine. Nothing's more invigorating than animal blood, am I right?"#npc$$821$1#|
10123|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You present Cal with the Antelope Blood you collected.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"I had no idea you would do such an efficient job!"#br#
#&53$Cal crows happily.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"I'm going to officially name you as my assistant. When the time is right, I'll teach you everything I know! I bet you're a fast learner!"#npc$$821$1#|
10124|After checking you out, Cal remarks that a mental imbalance may have caused vertigo and fatigue; the other lumberjacks had the same afflictions. He asks you to collect some ingredients so he can prepare a refreshing medicine.

Hunt Floppy-Eared Antelope near the logging site, then return with their blood.|
10131|#&7$Cal##br#
"I've almost completely ground up these herbs. We should put some Wild Forest Mushrooms into the medicine and grind them together, too..."#br##br#
#&53$Cal suddenly pauses to examine the medicine.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"I used up the mushrooms last time I prepared a medication. I haven't had time to seek them out again."#br##br#
#&53$Cal scratches his head, anxious.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"%n%, looks like I need to ask you to go gather some wild mushrooms. They typically grow near tree trunks. Take a look around the area, and I'm sure you'll find 'em."#npc$$821$1#|
10132|#&7$Cal##br#
"These mushrooms may well be Skandia's most valuable resource. A good deal of caravans come to the port just to buy them. I hear they are also excellent in risotto."#npc$$821$1#|
10133|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Cal grins when you hand him the Wild Mushrooms.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"Perfect! These are Skandia's most unique mushrooms."#br##br#
#&53$Cal examines them out one by one.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"You are truly an excellent assistant,"#br##br#
#&53$Cal comments, patting you on the back.##npc$$821$1#|
10134|Cal used up his supply of Forest Mushrooms while preparing another medication, so he asks you to go to the forest again to collect more of them.

Go and collect Wild Forest Mushrooms nearby.|
10141|#&7$Cal##br#
"Good! Put them together and give 'em a good grind. Then mix in this medicine, bottle it, and we're done! Easy, eh?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"I'll let you try this bottle of Refreshing Potion. Trust me, it'll make you feel better."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"Wait until your mind stabilizes, then please send the potion to the lumberjacks."#npc$$821$1#|
10142|#&7$Cal##br#
"Drink it up. It's the only way you'll have the energy to work tomorrow,"#br#
#&53$Cal says with a grin.##npc$$821$1#|
10143|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Something strange is happening to your body. You can feel the potion pumping through your every vein, and you also feel rather nauseous. You quickly explain your symptoms to Cal.##char$$501:75$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"What?! That medicine shouldn't have had any side effects. Let me take a closer look."#npc$$823$1#|
10144|Cal asks you to drink the Refreshing Potion; he assures you that you will feel much better afterward.

Use the Refreshing Potion.|
10151|#&7$Cal##br#
"Why do you feel dizzy? Could you be allergic to the medicine? Here, look. How many fingers am I holding up?"#npc$$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You suddenly faint.##char$$501:75$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"Hey! %n%, what happened? Maybe we ought to induce vomiting..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take deep breaths to control the dizziness. Your body begins to feel lighter as you fill your lungs with clean air.##char$$810:75$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"Something's appeared next to you. And, um, it's getting brighter..."#br##br#
#&53$Cal tries to mask his worry, but you can tell he is sweating.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You turn and see a Light Orb floating next to you. It emits a faint blue light. You have a feeling it was the cause of your dizziness.##M600010$Blue Light Orb$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You immediately ask Cal what is happening.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you speak, the Blue Light Orb reacts as though it is answering your questions and begins hovering around your body.##M600010$Blue Light Orb$823$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"This... is just a bottle of Refreshing Potion. It can't make this kind of thing happen..."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Cal##br#
"I don't understand. I've never seen anyone react this way to my medicine."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Awkward silence hangs in the air. After a moment, Cal takes a deep breath.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Cal##br#
"All I can say is, um... %n%, don't worry... You'd better go to the statue at the Statue Ruins right away. Find the Witch's Assistant, Flower. Perhaps she can give you an explanation."#npc$$821$1#|
10152|#&7$Flower##br#
"Originally, there was some sort of connection between these Runic letters. I don't know why I didn't think about that before,"#br##br#
#&53$Flower muses, her head in her hands.##npc$$821$1#|
10153|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You appear in front of Flower. The look on her face betrays an overwhelming sense of horror.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"You, too..."#br##br#
#&53$Flower murmurs to herself as she stares at the Light Orb.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Blue Light Orb##br#
#&53$It seems that the mysterious Light Orb is reacting to you and the people nearby. This perplexes you even more.##M600010$Blue Light Orb$821$0#|
10154|Cal can't explain the mysterious spirit that suddenly appears beside you. He suggests you go to the Statue at the Ruins to ask the Witch's Assistant, Flower, for help.

Go to the remains of the stone statue at Statue Ruins and talk with the Witch's Assistant.|
10161|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Flower everything that happened and beg for assistance.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"If I can help you, I'm more than willing to do so. I've seen something like this before. There was a spirit - a Light Orb - following me, but..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Hearing that the same thing had happened to Flower sparks hope in your heart. However, you notice that she is focused on the machine in your hands.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Something happened a while ago. Elena needed me to decipher the Runic letters on the statue. She said it was urgent, but she never explained why. However, her request has proven excessively difficult. The first time I translated the spell, it was stolen. Now the Fairies nearby won't let me anywhere near the Stone Statue."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"First, I need you to help me get rid of those pesky Petal Fairies and Forest Fairies. Only then can I freely search for clues about the stone statue."#npc$$821$1#|
10162|#&7$Flower##br#
"These are all old runic letters, but whoever etched them upon the stone probably didn't want others to decipher his message easily. This must be the reason..."#npc$$821$1#|
10163|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Flower that you have cleared away the Fairies.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"I'm so glad you're here to help! Otherwise, I'd never be able to decipher these runes."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Just as you are about to speak, a black shadow suddenly races over to you. Both you and Flower shriek in surprise.##M216010s75h-10$Ostrich$101$1#

#&7$Ostrich##br#
#&53$After a moment, you can see that the shadowy figure is actually an ostrich. It doesn't seem afraid to get close to you.##M216010$Ostrich$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$For a moment, you have no idea how to react.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Hey, Beebis, come!"#br##br#
#&53$Flower tries to pull the ostrich closer, but it ambles away toward you.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"This is Beebis, one of Elena's ostriches. He's a bit shy..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$Flower calls out again, but Beebis pays no attention. It continues pacing around you.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$2$1#|
10164|Flower needs to analyze the runic letters on the stone statue, but nearby mischievous fairies are in the way. You need to expel them.

"Ugh, forget it. I have far more important things to do."#br##br#
#&53$Flower sighs, giving up on Beebis. She returns to studying the runes on the Stone Statue.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You peer at the runes as Flower taps her feet impatiently.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$Beebis continues to stay by your side, watching your every move. It seems very interested in the Light Orb.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$2$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"This is useless! There is no translation book for ancient spells. I can't possibly decipher all these. Heck, these runes aren't even complete! Some of them are mostly worn off."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You find small mounds all around the place. Broken pieces of slate are buried beneath them. You report your findings to Flower.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Wow! Some fragments of the ruins must be buried under these mounds. Hurry; help me dig. The most important information is carved on these fragments."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Flower what she plans to do about the ancient spell translations. Even if you collect all of the shards, she still might not be able to decipher them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"I suppose you're right. I have two choices. I can defeat the Ruins Giant that stole the translation information... Or I can spend a few days retranslating the ancient spells in Navea."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It sounds like the first choice would be much quicker. You ask Flower where you could find the Ruins Giant.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"You want to take on that beastly thing? He dwells in the Ruins Cave not far from here, but you'd better be careful."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and prepare to set out. Beebis trots behind you eagerly.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$3001$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Beebis, come here. Don't get in %n%'s way!" #br##br#
#&53$Flower drags Beebis back.##npc$$827$1#|
10172|#&7$Flower##br#
"How annoying. The most important parts have flaked off. Who knows what was predicted here?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Beebis, stop following %n%. You're only causing trouble!"#br#
#&53$Flower shouts, frustrated.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$Beebis takes a step back, then quickly catches back up with you.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$2$0#|
10173|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand everything you've found, including the Relic Fragments, to Flower. You also give her the secret translation information.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Well, at least we found most of the fragments. Let me see. This part should go here, and that one must be placed there..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Ah, it fits together like a puzzle! I can finally decipher the message inscribed in the statue!"#br##br#
#&53$Flower claps gleefully.##npc$$825$1#|
10174|Flower needs you to help excavate the Relic Fragments from under the nearby mounds of dirt. She also asks you to head to the Ruins Cave, defeat the Ruins Giant, and bring back the stolen translation information. 

Dig up the Relic Fragments from the Mound, defeat the Ruins Giant, and retrieve the translation information.|
10181|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your heart races anxiously; you ask Flower about the message on the stone statue.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Do you really want to know?"#br##br#
#&53$Flower looks at you, eyes welling with anxiety and fear.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"It means that a hero who will save the world will be born here. But it also says... the hero could become a demon that could destroy the very fabric of our universe."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Not long ago, a teenaged boy named Brian came looking for Elena. Just like you, he also had a spirit with him."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"He firmly believed he was cursed by an evil spell, so he wanted to ask Elena for help. But the next day..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Brian's personality completely changed. He shattered everything in Elena's place and snapped her staff in two... I'm telling you this because you must stay vigilant."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"It's clear that Beebis doesn't see you as a dangerous person."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Worrying that you might end up like Brian, you tentatively ask what happened to him next.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Brian fled to the forest. The village garrison is investigating this case right now. Maybe Garrison Member Willie will have some clues."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, planning to ask Willie directly.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$When you turn to leave, Beebis grabs your sleeve with its beak and gently pulls you back.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$2$1#

#&7$Flower##br#
"Hmm, %n%, it looks like you'll have to take Beebis with you. Perhaps he can serve as your mount for now. Elena won't mind if you take him out for a trip, I'm sure!"#npc$$821$1#|
10182|#&7$Willie##br#
"Even a small, quaint fishing village like this isn't really safe,"#br#
#&53$Willie mutters sadly.##npc$$821$1#|
10183|#&7$Willie##br#
"Good lord, %n%! You scared me to death! What are you doing here?!"#npc$$823$1#|
10184|Flower mentions a young man, Brian, who was also accompanied by a spirit. He destroyed a witch's house and her wand, then went missing. You need to meet with Willie and ask him about the situation.

Talk with Garrison Member Willie in Timbria Forest.|
10191|#&7$Willie##br#
"Why are you looking for Brian, too? Do you know him?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shake your head fiercely.##br##br#
"I have an urgent issue, and I must speak to him to clear things up."#char$$821$0#

#&7$Willie##br#
"You really want to know where he is? He's as crazy as the day is long; he's been attacking residents! A couple beans short of a chili, if you know what I mean. If you want to investigate, you can talk to Larry, a traveling merchant. He's the person Brian most recently attacked."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Willie##br#
"But before meeting with him, could you help me drive the Sunbirds out of here? They keep stealing our fruit!"#npc$$821$1#|
10192|#&7$Larry##br#
"Ugh, why does stuff like this always happen to me?"#br#
#&53$he groans with a heavy sigh.##npc$$828$1#|
10193|#&7$Larry##br#
"Brian, Brian...oh, yeah, the crazy jerk who broke my wagon, right? He smacked me! With his hand!"#br##br#
#&53$Larry whines.##npc$$826$1#|
10194|Brian attacked residents near the forest and assaulted traveling merchant Larry. Willie asks you to talk with the merchant. You also need to help Willie drive away birds that had been stealing fruit.

Expel the Sunbirds from the forest, and talk with traveling merchant Larry in the middle of the forest.|
10201|#&7$Larry##br#
"What? You don't know? Well, what can I do? I need to be compensated for this!"#br##br#
#&53$Larry roars, frustrated.##br##npc$$828$1#
 
#&7$Larry##br#"I'm sorry. I know it's not your fault. I just need to calm down."#br##br#
#&53$He sighs again.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You see goods scattered about and wonder if you should help him with the investigation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Larry##br#
"You still want to assist me? Could you just help me bring those scattered boxes over here? Please?"#npc$$821$1#|
10202|#&7$Larry##br#
"Luckily, we only lost one box of food,"#br#
#&53$Larry grunts.##npc$$821$1#|
10203|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You help shove the scattered crates back to Larry's side.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Larry##br#
"Glad you're here to help. I couldn't move all this stuff on my own. I'm Larry, by the way, and I'm a traveling merchant."#br##br#
#&53$He sticks out his hand. You shake it gamely, then introduce yourself to him.##char$$821$0#|
10204|Brian destroyed the wagon when he stole the goods. You decide to help Larry gather the scattered goods and put them back where they belong. 
Bring the scattered goods back to Larry.|
10211|#&7$Larry##br#
"%n%, I'm afraid I need to ask you for another favor."#br##br#
#&53$Larry rummages through the scattered goods and fishes out a package.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Larry##br#
"I'd like to ask you to send this package to my friend Bentley on my behalf. It's just some dried food he asked me to buy for him several days ago. Though the other items were destroyed, this will prevent him from going hungry, at least."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Larry##br#
"There's something in it for you, too. This friend of mine has been hunting here for ages, so he knows this forest like the back of his hand. Perhaps he can help you find Brian."#npc$$821$1#|
10212|#&7$Bentley##br#
"Well, what really happened to Brian,"#br#
#&53$Bentley mutters, pressing down on a bleeding wound.##npc$$821$1#|
10213|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the package to Bentley and explain why you've come. He winces as he listens to you; you quickly realize he has been badly injured.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Bentley##br#
"Beebis? Why is Elena's house ostrich here with you?"#br##br#
#&53$Bentley clutches his bleeding wound, staring into Beebis's beady eyes.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain why Beebis is following you, then inquire about Bentley's injuries.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Bentley##br#
"It's Brian. I just don't know what he's up to. I just saw him dragging a child deep into the forest. I approached him; I never thought he'd attack me so viciously."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$Bentley grinds his teeth, clearly in immense pain. Beebis rests his feathered head on your shoulder as though he, too, is concerned.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$2$0#|
10214|Larry knows you are now searching for Brian, so he suggests you ask his friend Bentley for help. You easily bring Bentley dried food from Larry as a sort of peace offering.

Take the Rations to Larry, who is deep inside Timbria Forest.

10221|#&7$Bentley##br#
"This is a pretty deep wound. I'm probably going to have to do something about it, eh?"#br##br#
#&53$Bentley winces.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inspect the festering wound with concern, then ask Bentley what you can do to help him.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Bentley##br#
"A bunch of Grass Sprouts reside in the forest. The slime they produce can stop the bleeding and help the wound heal. Please collect some slime and fluid from the sprouts."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Bentley##br#
"Beebis, follow %n%."#br##br#
#&53$Bentley swallows hard, hiding his pain badly, and shoos you and Beebis away.##npc$$1$1#|
10222|#&7$Bentley##br#
"Gasp... gasp... cough, cough!"|
10223|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hurriedly hand the collected liquid to Bentley.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Bentley##br#
#&53$Bentley quickly mixes two liquids and applies the viscous solution to his laceration. The endless bleeding from the wound begins to slow. The pained look fades from Bentley's face.##npc$$828$1#|
10224|Bentley is seriously wounded. He asks you to capture some Mischievous Sprouts and Grass Sprouts and extract their blood-stanching body fluid from them. 

Capture Mischievous Sprouts and Grass Sprouts near Hushglen Hollow, and come back with their Sticky Secretions and Cooling Liquid.|
10231|#&7$Bentley##br#
"%n%, thank you. I feel much better..."#br##br#
#&53$Bentley nods weakly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bentley##br#
"You know you have a Light Orb following you, right? Or am I hallucinating?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You feel utterly depressed after hearing that from Bentley. You both gaze at the Spirit warily. Beebis cocks his head, watching the Orb carefully.##M600010$Blue Light Orb$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Bentley that you need to rid yourself of the spirit. However, you are still determined to find Brian and talk with him.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Bentley##br#
"How will that fool help? I have a good friend who might be able to actually lend a hand."#br##br#
#&53$Bentley opens a small bag hanging around his waist. From inside the bag, he removes an amulet.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bentley##br#
"I'm gonna lend you this amulet. It's a token of friendship between Elena and I. Go to Elena's house with this, and I know she'll come up with a way to help you."#npc$$821$1#|
10232|#&7$Elena##br#
"There's nothing wrong with the content deciphered by Flower. So why on earth would the creator choose a small, insignificant place like Skandia?"#npc$$821$1#|
10233|#&7$Elena##br#
"Stop! You take one step forward, and you'll be sorry!"#br##br#
#&53$Fire flashes through Elena's eyes as she prepares to cast magic, but her demeanor immediately softens when she sees the spirit next to you... and her beloved Beebis.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly explain that you need her help, handing her the amulet from Bentley.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Elena##br#
"You... you have a spirit. That boy Brian, he had one, too,"#br##br#
#&53$Elena recalls coldly.##br##br#
"At first, I wanted to help him, but his spirit transformed into a sinister black panther."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elena##br#
"He and the panther ran into the house and attacked me, then broke my staff in two..."#npc$$821$1#|
10234|Bentley considers you a reliable person, so he tells you to go to Witch Elena's place; he believes she can assist you.

Take Bentley's amulet to Elena's place to ask for help.|
10241|#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$Beebis quietly follows behind you.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$1$0#

#&7$Elena##br#
#&53$Elena stares with a suspicious expression before her gaze shifts to Bentley's token.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Elena##br#
"It's a real surprise. Beebis is always so shy, but he seems to have taken a liking to you. Maybe this proves that you pose no danger."#br##br#
#&53$Elena arches an eyebrow, giving you a once-over.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Sensing that she is softening toward you, you ask Elena if she can help you remove the spirit following you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Elena##br#
"Any friend of Bentley's is a friend of mine. However, you're going to have to help me fix my staff before I can cast any such spell."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elena##br#
"The staff lost all its energy when Brian attacked me. You must help me power it up again."#br##br#
#&53$Elena removes three brightly colored gems from a bag.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elena##br#
"This is the Water Gem, Tree Gem and Magic Gem. You should go to the wharf, Logging Site, and ruins with the corresponding gems. I will use teleportation magic to send you back to Port Skandia when you're ready. With Beebis's help, you shouldn't have much trouble."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$*After you take on the quest, Elena will teleport you to Port Skandia.#|
10242|#&7$Elena##br#
"Have all three gems recovered their power? We've no time to lose. You should get this done as quickly as possible."#npc$$821$1#|
10243|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You return to Elena and give her the three gems, each practically vibrating with energy.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Elena##br#
#&53$After Elena embeds the three gems in her staff, they begin to radiate dazzling rays of brilliant light.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elena##br#
"Ah, they've regained their power. Next, I will cast the exorcism spell on you. If it goes as planned, it will remove the Spirit that follows you."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Elena##br#
"However, if it fails, and the spirit takes you over, I will have no choice but to use my magic to defeat you. Do you understand?"#npc$$826$1#|
10244|Elena explains that she will help you remove the curse, but she needs to make a new wand first. She asks you to bring three kinds of gems - a Water Gem, Tree Gem and Magic Gem - to three different places - the wharf, the Logging Site and the ruins - to recover their power.

Use the Water Gem near the pier, the Tree Gem near the Logging Site, and the Magic Gem near the ruins.|
10251|#&7$Elena##br#
"%n%, are you ready? I have some special magic I can try on that spirit. As for the results, well, we'll just have to wait and see."#npc$$821$1#|
10252|#&7$Elena##br#
"..." #npc$$821$1$1#|
10253|#&7$Elena##br#
#&53$Elena waves her wand and recites an incantation you have never heard before.##M105011$Elena$2011$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A warm mist fills the air. Elena's magic makes you feel as though you are floating, which makes sense, because when you open your eyes, you are hovering in midair.##char$$503$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You try to relax as the wind whips around you, but you can't help but let out a small shriek of surprise.##char$$503:75$0#

#&7$Elena##br#
"%n%, are you okay? It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be any worse than a light fever. A little grogginess shouldn't be a problem for you, right?"#M105011$Elena$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You want to answer, but you can't say a word. You try to resist the pressure of the whirling air; it seems to grow hotter and hotter with every passing second.##char$$504:75$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The air is suddenly violent, as though it is trying to swallow you whole. An electric pain shoots through your body.##char$$502:78$0#

#&7$Elena##br#
"%n%?!" #M105011$Elena$311$1#

#&7$Elena##br#
#&53$Elena cries out when she sees the pain on your face and immediately stops reciting the incantation.##M105011$Elena$2012$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The light of the spell extinguishes; you collapse to the ground in pain.##char$$506$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The spirit that had haunted you ominously changes its form into a creature you have never seen before.##pet$???$52$1#|

Speak with Elena, and begin the magic spell.|

"%n%... you've got a monster on your back, eh? Are you bound by a curse, too?"#br##br#
#&53$Kane keeps one hand on his weapon as he sizes you up.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Kane's words pain you; you have to find Brian and ask him to clarify the situation. You hope Kane can tell you where Brian is.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kane##br#
"Brian took the Village Chief's son, Joel. When we tried to save the boy, a black panther attacked us. They're hiding in the cave now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Kane that the creature with you might have something to do with Brian, hoping he'll allow you into the cave to find Brian. You have to find a way to rescue Joel!##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kane##br#
"I don't know what to do. You two are both cursed by spirits, so perhaps you are bound together somehow... Hopefully, through Brian, you can save yourself."#npc$$821$1#|

"Dad, Brian... he's not... he's transformed... I was so scared..."#M001010$Joel$829$0#

#&7$York##br#
"Don't be afraid, son. Hush. Daddy's here. It will all be alright."#br##br#
#&53$York glances at you with unease. Will it really be okay?##M005010$York$821$1#|
10264|Kane saw Brian take the Village Chief's son, Joel, into a cave. He fears the boy's life is in danger, so he agrees to let you into the cave to stop Brian.

"%n%, I owe you big time... But, um, could you tell us exactly what happened?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Sheila rests a hand on your shoulder tenderly; you can't help but shed a single tear. All of the suffering and fear you have hidden deep within yourself suddenly leaps to the surface.##char$$829$0#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"I think that's enough for the day. Everyone is exhausted. You'll still have to say something eventually, but for now, let's all get some rest."#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$If what the creature says is true, you could follow the same path as Brian, and because of that, you have no choice but to leave the village.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"%n%, did you get a good night's sleep?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Sheila that you have decided to leave the village, and you plan to find a way to separate from your spirit, even if you have to travel to the ends of Earth.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"I thought you might come to that conclusion. There's nothing I can really say now that you've made up your mind."#npc$$821$1#|
10282|#&7$Sheila##br#
"It's just better this way..."#npc$$821$1#|
10283|#&7$Sheila##br#
"Have you met everyone you needed to meet? %n%, do you know where to go?"#br##br#
#&53$Sheila asks sorrowfully.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, though you truly aren't sure. Maybe it would be better to go to a big city with lots of people to ask about the issue. Perhaps you'll find someone who knows how to separate the spirit from your body.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"I don't know if this will help, but I once heard from a friend from Helonia about something called a Starlight Treasure Chest. Legend has it that an item within it can chase evil spirits away."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Upon hearing that, you brighten a bit. The Helonia Coast is located to the northwest of Port Skandia. You decide to go there and investigate.##char$$821$0#|
10284|After thinking about it overnight, you decide to leave Port Skandia and find a way to separate yourself from the spirit. After Sheila hears about your decision, she asks you bid everyone goodbye.

Say goodbye to Anita, Corey and Betsy.|
10285|#&7$Anita##br#
"You've really decided to leave?"#br##br#
#&53$Anita peers at you curiously.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anita##br#
"Well... you're just a kid. You need to take care of yourself. If somebody bullies you, you come back and let me know."#npc$$821$1#|
10286|#&7$Corey##br#
"%n%, I've heard about your situation. What have you decided to do?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shrug helplessly and inform Corey that you are considering looking for someone to help you. Somebody out there has to have a solution to your terrible dilemma.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Corey##br#
"I see that the spirit has no intention of harming anyone. Perhaps, in time, it could become your companion."#br##br#
#&53$Corey smiles encouragingly at your Eidolon.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Corey##br#
"Take it easy, and be careful. Nothing too exciting ever happens in this tiny town. The world outside this place - well, now there's an adventure!"#npc$$821$1#|
10287|#&7$Betsy##br#
"Are you really leaving today? I thought you'd stay for a few more days."#br##br#
#&53$There is an edge of sadness to Betsy's smile.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Betsy##br#
"I truly believe you will succeed. You're different from Brian. I know it in my very soul."#br##br#
#&53$Betsy nods with affirmation.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Betsy##br#
"Go ahead! Experience the brilliant journey of life and be sure to tell everyone about the wonders of Port Skandia! We could use some tourist money."#npc$$821$1#|
10291|#&7$Sheila##br#
"Once you get to the Helonia Coast look for a merchant named Luther. Tell him that you're looking for a Starlight Treasure Chest."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod. The news the Village Chief's wife gave you sparks new hope in your heart. Your journey now has a purpose.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"Did you pack all your things? You've got everything you need, right?"#br##br#
#&53$Sheila asks fretfully.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take inventory of all your equipment and suddenly notice that Beebis has followed you the whole time.##char$$2$0#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$Beebis seems tranquil, as though he is totally unaware of the tragedy that has taken place.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You affectionately ruffle Beebis's feathers; it is time to say goodbye. You have only spent a short amount of time together, but with Beebis by your side, you feel you aren't alone.##char$$822:71$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Sheila that you feel much better now, and you prepare to hit the road.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"Silly child! You're one of us: a citizen of Skandia. And Beebis is your companion now. We couldn't possibly just let you two leave without a proper goodbye!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sheila##br#
"Go quickly! Don't keep everyone waiting."#npc$$821$1#|
10292|#&7$Luther##br#
"What do you want to buy? I can help you find it more quickly."#npc$$821$1#|
10293|#&7$Luther##br#
"Welcome to Helonia. Are you here on business? Helonia's a wonderful place!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You politely introduce yourself to Luther and mention the Starlight Treasure Chest. You also explain what Sheila had said.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Sheila told you to look for me?"#br##br#
#&53$Luther scratches his head.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Well, I know about a Starlight Treasure Chest, but it's not mine. Madeline, Mayor of Helonia, has it."#npc$$1$1#|
10294|Sheila has assembled a farewell meeting for you. You don't want to keep the others waiting! 

Say goodbye to everyone and set out on your new journey to the Helonia Coast.|
10301|#&7$Luther##br#
"I understand how you feel, but the Town Mayor doesn't have time to solve your problem."#br##br#
#&53$Luther shrugs passively.##M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Panic crosses your face. You ask Luther why the mayor can't help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Not long ago, the Catseye Pirate Crew threatened the Town Mayor and demanded protection money. If she didn't pay up, they told her all of Helonia would suffer."#M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"The deadline to pay them off is approaching, and we're still missing half the goods. The Mayor is scrambling to solve this crisis."#M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Hey, if it's really urgent, go ahead and talk to her. The worst thing she can say is 'no.'"#M103030$Luther$828$1#|
10302|#&7$Luther##br#
"If you need a Starlight Treasure Chest, you should look for the Town Mayor, Madeline. I cannot do it for you."#M103030$Luther$828$1#|
10303|#&7$Luther##br#
"You don't look too good. I guess she didn't have the time to solve your problem, eh?"#M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"But I did say I'd try to help you, and I'm a man of my word. I'll think of a way to get you out of your pickle."#br##br#
#&53$Luther strokes his chin, thinking.##M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Maybe..."#br##br#
#&53$His eyes light up. You lean in eagerly.##M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"This protection money issue is really putting pressure on the Town Mayor. If you can help her out, I bet she'd be willing to help you, too."#npc$$821$1#|
10304|Pirates on the Helonia Coast run rampant. Lately, they have been demanding cash and various treasures. The Town Mayor is busy collecting these items for the bloodthirsty cads.

Talk with Helonia Mayor Madeline.|
10305|#&7$Madeline##br#
#&53$Madeline paces tautly. She glances at you, but it is clear she doesn't want to talk.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You force a friendly smile and greet Madeline, then ask about borrowing the treasure chest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I have more important matters to attend to right now, and you're not a resident of this town. Why should I give you the Starlight Treasure Chest?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"If there's nothing else I can help you with, you should probably go."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
#&53$Madeline closes her eyes for a moment, sighing deeply.##br##br#
"We're still missing half. What are we going to do? Why can't Selena understand?"#npc$$828$1#|
10311|#&7$Luther##br#
"As far as I know, the pirates are demanding, among other things, the fruit that grows on the Helonia Coast. It's quite famous. It's Selena's favorite."#br##br#
#&53$Luther blushes scarlet.##M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Who's Selena? And why does she make you so nervous?"#br##br#
#&53$%p% pipes up.##pet$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Um, Selena is the Town Mayor's daughter. We grew up together."#br##br#
#&53$Luther smoothes his hair, clearly flustered.##M103030$Luther$823$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Your pulse has quickened. That's what happens when humans feel the emotion known as 'fear.' Is this Selena a wretched monster of some kind?"#pet$$822$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"No, not at all! Selena is a wonderful, beautiful girl. I... I've actually always liked her..."#M103030$Luther$826$1#|
10312|#&7$Madeline##br#
"I haven't the energy to think about anything else. Dealing with these Pirates is no easy task."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Helonia didn't produce enough fruit this year. I don't know what to do."#npc$$828$1#|
10313|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You place the pile of collected fruit in front of Madeline.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
#&53$Madeline raises a surprised eyebrow. She cocks her head, staring at you.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$Suddenly, Beebis snatches up a piece of fruit and gulps it down.##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Hey! Stop that! That is your master's property,"#br#
#&53$Snaps %p%, moving the fruit out of Beebis's reach.##pet$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
#&53$Madeline still looks utterly puzzled.##br##br#
"Where did this fruit come from?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell her about Luther; he hopes that the fruit gathered from the Tanuki will solve Helonia's dilemma.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"That Luther is a smart one. If Selena were half as mature as he is, I wouldn't have to worry so much."#br##br#
#&53$Madeline sighs heavily.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"And, um, thank you. I apologize for my rudeness. I just have way too much on my mind."#npc$$821$1#|
10314|Luther suggests collecting some materials to help the Town Mayor. If you can manage the favor, the mayor would trust you, and conversations with her would likely go much more smoothly in the future. 

Find the fruit the Autumn Tanukis living outside Helonia stole.|
10315|#&7$Madeline##br#
"The problems seem insurmountable. Not only do we have a severe shortage, but the Tanuki outside the village keep disrupting the villagers with their incessant fighting."#npc$$821$1#|
10321|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Madeline if there is some way you can help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
#&53$Madeline sighs again and shakes her head.##br##br#
"I just have to keep calm, even in the face of the pirates. If I panic, everyone else will, too."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"My daughter Selena and I are fighting, too. We exchanged words, and she just up and left. I haven't heard from her since. I can't help but worry about her!" #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I can't think clearly lately. The Tanuki outside the town squawk and squeak constantly. They just never shut up! I'm begging you. Please get rid of them; I've had a migraine for months!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I'll consider what you said, but I must deal with the pirates first. Find Luther if you need something."#npc$$821$1#|
10322|#&7$Luther##br#
"The Tanuki outside the village are growing more rambunctious by the day. The Town Mayor is about to lose her mind. She must be under so much pressure. I wish Selena were a bit more understanding."#npc$$821$1#|
10323|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Luther that you've already driven off the Tanuki, then you tell him what the Town Mayor said.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Thank you for your hard work. %n%. The Town Mayor said she might consider your Starlight Treasure Chest request. That's a huge win for you!"#M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"When I'm done helping the Town Mayor inventory the supplies, I'll go looking for Selena. For now, I'm sure the Mayor just appreciates the quiet."#M103030$Luther$828$1#|
10324|The shrieking Tanuki are driving the mayor insane. You need to drive them away. 

Get rid of the noisy Tanuki living outside Helonia for Madeline.|
10331|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Luther why the townsfolk don't just band together to resist the Pirates.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
#&53$Luther releases a long sigh.##br##br#
"The people here just want to live in peace. If they can solve the problem by throwing money at it, that's what they'll do."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"But not everyone shares this viewpoint. If I remember correctly, the younger of the Fisherman Brothers, Braeden, doesn't want to hand over the cash or goods."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Perhaps you can find his older brother, Isaac, and speak to him. Maybe you can come up with a way to convince Braeden. We could really use Braeden's help collecting supplies."#npc$$821$1#|
10332|#&7$Braeden##br#
"Can I help you?"#npc$$821$1#|
10333|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Braeden why you have come, but he seems increasingly annoyed.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Let me tell you something. I won't be threatened. I won't give those pirates a dime!"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden seethes.##M003010$Braeden$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Braeden that you agree, but resisting will only alert the pirates to your plan.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
#&53$Braeden stares at you a moment, thinking.##M003010$Braeden$828$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"You know what? You're right. I didn't think of that. We can't just blatantly resist them."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I'll prepare the supplies for the pirates, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve."#M003010$Braeden$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, but insist that the entire town still needs to fully prepare if they hope to fight back.##char$$806$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"You know, I just met you, but I think we're gonna get along just fine."#br##br#
#&53$Braeden grins.##M003010$Braeden$825$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Count me in. I've got some ideas on how to take down the pirates. I'll prepare all the supplies before executing the plan."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#|
10334|The entire town hopes that things will return to normal after they hand over the supplies to the pirates. However, one young man, Braeden, refuses to give anything to them. You need to convince him otherwise. 

Explain to Isaac about his brother Braeden's situation and try to convince Braeden not to brashly resist the pirates. 
|
10335|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You relay Luther's words to Isaac and explain that you want to convince Braeden to hand over the goods.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"I'm worried about Braeden. His refusal to hand over the supplies might provoke the pirates."#br##br#
#&53$Isaac sighs.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"My brother won't listen to me. There will always be more fish to catch; a few trout aren't worth his life. He just doesn't understand."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Well, I guess since you're willing to convince him, it's worth a try."#npc$$821$1#|
10341|#&7$Braeden##br#
"I'll take all the fish that we've caught recently to a nearby hut. Add that to the fish stock, and we should meet the quota."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"It won't be so easy to get the fish to the pirates, though."#br##br#
#&53$Braeden bites his lip, thinking.##M003010$Braeden$823$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"The pirates' activity has forced Sun Crabs to gather near town. One of 'em is larger and stronger than the rest. The townsfolk call him Mobray the Giant Crab."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Unfortunately, the crabs are converging on the very place where I put all the fish."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Braeden that you will help him fend off the Crabs and bring back the catch.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"The hut containing the fish is in the southern section of the eastern coast. Don't underestimate those Sun Crabs, though. Their pincers can snap straight through human bone."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#|
10342|#&7$Braeden##br#
"After we get the catch back, we need to take inventory and add it to the payment. I don't want to give even one extra fish to those thieving cads."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"The fish are stored in a hut south of the eastern coast. but watch out for the blasted Sun Crabs."#npc$$821$1#|
10343|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Braeden grins widely as you present the catch to him.##char$$822$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I saw what you did on the coast!"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden crows, his eyes full of awe.##M003010$Braeden$824$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I've never seen someone with such skill. Every last Sun Crab scampered away, terrified. You even defeated Mobray!"#M003010$Braeden$825$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I had no idea you had such battle prowess. You could teach me a thing or two, partner."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#|
10344|Sun Crabs swarm the hut where the fish is stored. To retrieve the catch, you have to get rid of the Sun Crabs. 

Drive off all the Sun Crabs near the hut and bring back the catch.|
10351|#&7$Braeden##br#
"We'll prepare the supplies and carry out our plans against the Pirates simultaneously, so listen close."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I plan to lead the entire band of pirates to an open area, then use gunpowder to blast 'em to high heaven in one fell swoop."#M003010$Braeden$826$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I've already told others in town, and we've a good deal of gunpowder. We need to refine the powder to transform it into a powerful bomb."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask how you can help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"We need this bomb to do some serious damage. Will you help collect materials for the bomb's outer casing?" #M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Collect some of the nearby Hard Fruit. Once we soak and dry 'em, we can use them as shrapnel. That'll give our bomb some extra punch."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"After you collect the Hard Fruits, soak them in the sea."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I'll stay here and work on dividing up the gunpowder. We don't have a lot of time to prepare, so it's best if we divide and conquer!"#M003010$Braeden$826$1#|
10352|#&7$Braeden##br#
"Just you wait, you filthy pirates! You won't trifle with the good people of Helonia again!"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden exclaims.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"We don't have much time. You must quickly find the Hard Fruit. We can't do anything without 'em,"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden urges eagerly.##npc$$821$1#|
10353|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the sopping wet Hard Fruit to Braeden.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Okay, I'll dry out the Hard Fruit, then fill them with gunpowder. These will teach those cads a lesson they won't soon forget."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I've considered the options carefully, but the best place for our plan is at the beach right in front of us."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#|
10354|Braeden's plans are heating up. First, he needs to collect weapons. He asks you to collect Hard Fruit to use as the casings for bombs. When soaked in water, then dried, they can do a great deal of damage as shrapnel. 

Collect hard fruits on the shore and soak them.



|
10361|#&7$Braeden##br#
"If we want to set our bombs on the beach, I need you to help prepare some waterproof paint."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#
#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You anxiously ask Braeden to be more specific.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"West of Helonia, you'll find Helonia Woods. Forest Beetles live there, and their gooey bodily secretions cause water to bead up. The goo is used as a sealant on many ships."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"The mist and fog are thick around the coast. If those bombs aren't waterproof, it could compromise the whole plan."#M003010$Braeden$828$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"We've gotta use the secretions to keep the gunpowder dry. Please help me collect the secretions of the Forest Beetles. I'll do my best to finish my current task by the time you get back."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#|
10362|#&7$Braeden##br#
"I've got to think everything through and lay out the plans completely. Maybe if I present the townsfolk with concrete ideas, I can tap into their suppressed rage toward the pirates,"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden contemplates, pacing.##npc$$2$1#|
10363|#&7$Braeden##br#
"Oh! You've brought a lot of Insect Fluid! Quick, let me take a look." #br##br#
#&53$Braeden snatches the vial of Insect Fluid out of your hands before you have a chance to respond.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I'm almost done with my work here. Let me think about what to do next..."#npc$$821$1#|
10364|Braeden's plan is in motion. This time, he needs to make waterproof paint out of a bug's bodily secretions. 

Collect body fluids from the Forest Beetles, and return to Braeden.|
10371|#&7$Braeden##br#
#&53$Braeden busily tinkers with the Insect Body Fluid, using a delicate brush to seal the Hard Fruit.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It appears that Braeden has already poured the gunpowder into the Hard Fruit peels. The bombs are almost fully prepared.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I know you're anxious to help out. I could use an extra set of hands to apply this sealant."#br##br#
#&53$Braeden's lips stretch into a smirk.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Just apply the bug fluids to the peels of the Hard Fruit, and the bombshells will be complete!"#npc$$824$1#|
10372|#&7$Braeden##br#
"Make sure you don't let the paint leak onto any part of the bomb, or we'll end up with a bunch of duds."#npc$$823$1#|
10373|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Braeden flashes a big grin when you hand him the sealed bombs.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"You are quite skilled. Nice attention to detail. Good job!"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden gives you the thumbs up as he carefully looks over the bombs.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I just wish my brother could join the fight. Unfortunately, he just doesn't get it, so I have to hide my plans from him."#br##br#
#&53$Braeden bites his lip and looks into the distance with a sad expression.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Ah, but I digress! Worry not; your work will not be in vain. These bombs will make the pirates run for the hills."#npc$$1$1#|
10374|The outer shells of the latest waterproof bombs are complete. You'll need to install them quickly. 

Make waterproof bombs with the material from Braeden.

"Now onto the next step of my plan,"#br#
#&53$Braeden exclaims.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"There's no time to lose!"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden brings out a few sheets of paper and begins scrawling on them.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"This is the beginning of the next step of my plan. We should distribute these flyers to the townspeople. We've got to incite the anger in them; they hate those dastardly pirates, but they're too afraid to fight back. Appeal to the townsfolk to stand together against the pirates."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Take these flyers and distribute them. Make sure that you don't lose them; they took me a long time to print up. I just know they'll get a good reaction out of the townsfolk."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Braeden that you will distribute the flyers, but you aren't sure if the townspeople will pass on the information as he hopes.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"It shouldn't be a problem. Everyone loves some good gossip. We need as many people to fight against the pirates as possible. However, I'm worried that my older brother will try to stop us when he hears the plan."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I think I'm getting an idea. After you've handed out the flyers, seek out my brother and find out if he's wise to our plan."#npc$$821$1#|
10382|#&7$Isaac##br#
"%n%, I'm glad we can agree. We're simple people. We don't need to make enemies of the pirates. Who knows what they could do if we angered them? We're no match for them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"What are you doing with those papers? Do you need some help?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You wave him off nervously. It would probably be better to talk to Isaac after you distribute the flyers.##char$$807:0$0#|
10383|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After you finish distributing the flyers, you chat with Isaac, asking him about the pirates.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"We all know those pirates are vicious cads, but we're just normal people. We're not experts like you, %n%. We shouldn't start trouble."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Speaking of which, I really must thank you. I've heard that, thanks to you, Braeden will hand over the supplies. I couldn't persuade him no matter how hard I tried."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Earlier, when I was fishing, I found something called a 'Secret Stone.' They say such a stone could be very useful for adventurers. I want to give it to you as a way to express my gratitude, but..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Noticing Isaac's hesitation, you ask him to tell you more.##char$$821$0#|
10384|Propaganda is definitely an important part of this war. You have to distribute the flyers to incite the townspeople to take a stand at last. 

Bring the flyers to the town and distribute them to the townsfolk.

10385|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You pass a flyer to an elderly townsman.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Grandpa##br#
#&53$He raises a white eyebrow and reads the paper.##br##br#
"I fully support fighting the pirates. I once got in a tussle with them in a pub when I was younger. I wasn't afraid of them then, and I'm certainly not afraid of them now!"#npc$$821$1#|
10386|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shove a flyer into the hands of a middle-aged man.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Middle-Aged Townsman##br#
"Don't go looking for problems! I have a wife and kid at home. I'm not going to pick a fight with a pirate, you fool!"#br##br#
#&53$Clearly agitated, the man crumples the flyer into a ball.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Middle-Aged Townsman##br#
"Get out of here! Don't come near my house again. I will have no part in your foolish plan!"#br##br#
#&53$He throws the paper ball to the ground, furious.##npc$$826$1#|
10387|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand a flyer to a young man.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Helonian Man##br#
#&53$He reads it with surprise, then smiles.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Helonian Man##br#
"Finally, someone's taking some action around here! We've put up with those pirates for far too long!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Helonian Man##br#
"You can count on my help. And my friends will be on your side, too."#br##br#
#&53$The Helonian Man grins, excitement in his eyes.##npc$$824$1#|
10388|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Isaac if he needs any help and notice an infectious grin on his face.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Oh! %n%, I haven't thanked you yet! We'll convince Braeden at last!"#br##br#
#&53$Isaac pats you on the shoulder.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"As for the tasks at hand, if you could lend a hand, we'd really appreciate it!"#npc$$821$1#|
10391|#&7$Isaac##br#
"While fishing, I accidentally caught a stone in my net, and it totally shredded the mesh. I need that net! Without it, my livelihood is all but destroyed."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"I'm still not sure what to do. I could get the materials needed to make a new net in the forest, but I've heard that the pirates frequent that area and tend to attack anyone who goes in alone."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Isaac what kinds of items he needs for the net, offering to help collect them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"That would be fantastic! You can get high-quality Thin Vines from the Vine Dryads and Fern Dryads in the Helonia Woods. The vines can be woven into excellent nets."#npc$$821$1#|
10392|#&7$Isaac##br#
"My foolish brother! I wonder if he took my words to heart. He needs to focus on fishing, not provoking pirates."#npc$$828$1#|
10393|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand all the Thin Vines to Isaac.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Wow, look at all of these!"#br##br#
#&53$he exclaims, clearly pleased.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Even without the whole pirate issue, it would've taken Braeden and I much longer to collect the Thin Vines."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Thank you so much."#npc$$821$1#|
10394|Braeden asks you to help him hide his plan to counterattack the pirates from his brother. Meanwhile, Isaac asks you to gather Thin Vines. 

Go to Helonia Woods and look for Vine Dryads, then bring back Thin Vines for Isaac.|
10401|#&7$Isaac##br#
"Before I leave, I must tell my brother something."#M003030$Isaac$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are momentarily taken aback. If Isaac finds Braeden, he'll definitely learn about the counterattack plan. Casually, you ask why he needs to find his brother.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"I fear that even though Braeden collected so many Thin Vines, he doesn't have the parrots the pirates are after... and I've still got the cages."#M003030$Isaac$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Pirates love parrots. What are you gonna do?"#br##br#
#&53$Isaac shrugs.##M003030$Isaac$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"I've got to make sure he remembers, or everything he's done up to this point will be for naught."#M003030$Isaac$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You anxiously stop Isaac in his tracks and tell him you'll help Braeden catch the parrots.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"You're willing to help? Excellent! I don't think Braeden has it in him to catch the birds anyway."#M003030$Isaac$828$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Take these cages and go to Helonia Woods. Catch the parrots. We fishermen mostly focus on, you know, fishing, so the pirates' request isn't an easy one for us. And the parrots aren't exactly the friendliest birds ever..."#M003030$Isaac$821$1#|
10402|#&7$Braeden##br#
"Don't let a little mistake ruin the whole counterattack plan."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I feel like I'm forgetting something... eh, I'm sure it wasn't that important."#npc$$828$1#|
10403|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Braeden the Wild Parrots and tell him what Isaac had said.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I knew I was forgetting something! I nearly let a bunch of stupid birds ruin the whole plan!"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden groans, pulling at his hair.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I'm lucky to have your help - and my brother's too. You caught those dastardly birds a lot faster than I could've. Heck, even if I had a few days, I'm not sure I'd be able to catch 'em."#npc$$828$1#|
10404|Isaac explains that the pirates want Braeden to fetch some parrots. However, Braeden's abilities are mostly limited to fishing.  To stop Isaac from getting any closer to finding out about the plan, you volunteer to catch the parrots on Braeden's behalf. 

Go to Helonia Woods and catch some parrots for Braeden.

10411|#&7$Braeden##br#
"That was really close, but I've finally got everything I need."#br##br#
#&53$Braeden smiles, flushed.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Can you help me get these items into town? The mayor will be happy to see 'em,"#br##br#
#&53$Braeden grunts.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"I still have to go to my brother's place to get new fishing nets, and I've gotta make sure he's still in the dark about our plans. If you're ready, go ahead. I don't want to give the pirates a reason to start trouble."#npc$$821$1#|
10412|#&7$Madeline##br#
"We're missing Braeden's items. I can't believe he's not here yet!"#npc$$828$1#|
10413|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You place the box full of supplies next to the Town Mayor, explaining that these are the items Braeden is supposed to collect. Everything is accounted for within the box.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Wonderful!"#br##br#
#&53$Her expression lifts, then suddenly darkens.##npc$$828$1##&PP00301#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"The pirates... they're here. I hope things go as planned,"#br##br#
#&53$She murmurs, biting her lip.#|
10414|The items that Braeden needs are finally prepared. You have to take them to the Mayor as soon as possible. 

Take the Supply Trailer and find Madeline.

"Is that everything? Man, that's a lot of stuff... You've done pretty well. Now, step aside. Everything better be here..." #br##br#
#&53$The Pirate Corsair mutters and grunts to himself as he appraises the goods.##M122040$Pirate Corsair$821$1#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
"Heh, as I thought, not everything's here; you're trying to cheat us."#br##br#
#&53$The Pirate Corsair snickers ominously.##M122040$Pirate Corsair$825$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"What?! How is that possible? I'm certain everything's there..."#M115010$Madeline$823$0#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
"Just recently, adjutant Bluto increased the payment by 20 percent. You must have been told this."#M122040$Pirate Corsair$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"What? No, we weren't! Twenty percent... how could you do this?! We had an agreement!"#br##br#
#&53$Madeline argues agitatedly with the Pirate Corsair.##M115010$Madeline$826$0#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
"You have guts talking back like that! You must have a death wish!"#br##br#
#&53$The Pirate Corsair's voice rises in a threatening snarl as he draws his weapons.##M122042s90$Pirate Corsair$1001$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$You feel the rage inside you begin to boil over. %p% seems to feel the same way as you both step between the pirate and Madeline.##pet$$52$0#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
"You dare to interfere?"#br##br#
#&53$The Pirate Corsair shifts his gaze to you, narrowing his eyes menacingly.##M122042$Pirate Corsair$826$1#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
"I think I'll take you out first!"#br##br#
#&53$Abruptly, the Pirate Corsair charges towards you.##M122042$Pirate Corsair$101$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, watch out!"#pet$$52$0#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
#&53$The pirate slashes his blades at you as %p% cries out.##M122042$Pirate Corsair$1120$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You jump back, easily avoiding the attack.##char$$2050$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Pirate Corsair blinks, surprised, but before he can recover enough to attack again, you knock his weapons out of his hands.##char$$2020$0#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
"This...what...?! How...?!"#M122040$Pirate Corsair$823$1#

#&7$Pirate Corsair##br#
"You vile little twerp! Bluto WILL get all of what he's asked for. If you don't have it all to us by the deadline, we'll kill everyone in Helonia!"#M122040$ Pirate Corsair$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Pirate Corsair snarls with malice, then hurriedly rushes off.##clean$$1#|
10422|#&7$Madeline##br#
#&53$Madeline looks stunned.##br##br#
"We made an agreement. It wasn't supposed to be like this..."#npc$$821$1#|
10423|#&7$Madeline##br#
"%n%, thank you for saving me."#br##br#
#&53$Madeline sighs; you notice deep violet circles of exhaustion under her eyes.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I feel utterly useless. I thought I could just buy our way out of trouble. I should have known that those pirates could never be satisfied. Their avarice is a bottomless pit."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Looks like Braeden was right all along. The townsfolk have started an uprising. They're tired of handing over their hard-earned money to the pirates, and they've sworn to defeat them. It's time to stand up against those criminals. They cannot hold our town hostage any longer."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It appears that Madeline finally sees through the pirates' sinister scheme. You inform her of the plan you and Braeden have devised and explain how you plot to launch a counterattack against the pirates.##br#


Madeline##br#
"So you've finished the bombs? As Braeden said, it's essential to place them at Silverash Shores."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain that you still lack bait to lure the pirates, but once the task is complete, the most difficult part of the plan will be behind you.##char$$821$0#|
10424|The Pirates have launched their merciless attack against the Mayor. You can no longer tolerate it.

It's time to teach the Pirate Corsair a rather bloody lesson!|
10431|#&7$Madeline##br#
"%n%, I think I know how to lure in the pirates."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"They're after anything of value. If we pretend that some treasure has just washed ashore, they'll be on it like white on rice."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, but remind Madeline that the pirates have taken all of the supplies. What kind of treasures could Helonia possibly have?##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"You're right; we've given them almost everything we have. However, I know an Alchemist on the Helonia Coast. They say he can turn stones into fool's gold. You'd never know it wasn't real!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Maybe we can ask him for help and lure the pirates to the Silverash Shores with the fake gold."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask for the Alchemist's location.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"He's at Bella's Orchard, I believe. The Orchard Master there has taken him in before."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Madeline that, as town mayor, she should gather the townsfolk immediately and ready the plan. You will find the Alchemist.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"You're right. I'll gather all the townsfolk and carry out the plan. Braeden will prepare the dynamite."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Bella's Orchard is northwest of the town. Go find Vance, the Orchard Master, and he'll help you find the Alchemist."#npc$$827$1#|

"Mommy and daddy have been so sad. I hear them crying each night."#br##br#
#&53$Donny's own eyes fill with tears.##npc$$829$1#|
10434|Madeline suggests that you enlist the help of the Alchemist and use fake gold to deceive the Pirates. Thus, you travel to Bella's Orchard to find the Alchemist.  

Discover the location of the Alchemist by talking to the couple from Bella's Orchard.|

#&53$You explain to Bella why you have come.##char$$821$0#

"I can understand what the Town Mayor has gone through, but I support my husband's decision. No matter what, I will always be on his side."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"The Orchard's harvests have been poor recently. It's been a difficult season for us...one of the most difficult we've ever faced."#br##br#
#&53$Bella sighs sadly.##npc$$828$1#|
10436|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Vance the purpose of your visit, hoping he will divulge the whereabouts of the Alchemist. You desperately need the fool's gold to lure the pirates to their demise.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Vance##br#
"It appears Madeline has already made her decision...Things have changed so much at this stage. I must consider my next actions carefully."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Vance##br#
"Though I detest the pirates, I cannot tell you the location of the Alchemist. His talents are in demand by the wrong people. Villains and thieves are fully willing to resort to unscrupulous methods and threats to force him to make the gold. That's why he had to flee Helonia."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Vance##br#
"He does not wish to be disturbed by anyone again. I must respect his wishes and keep him safe. I cannot support your plan. I hope you understand...."#npc$$821$1#|
10441|#&7$Donny##br#
"Recently, Fruit Beetles have swarmed the Orchard. They scarf down our fruit without a second thought. Daddy tried a bunch of ways to drive them away, but nothing has worked."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Donny##br#
"Daddy works in the Orchard for days on end. He just doesn't have time for Mommy or me. I want to help, but Daddy doesn't allow me to get anywhere near those nasty bugs."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Donny##br#
"Since I'm not allowed to help, could you do me a favor and drive the Fruit Beetles out of the Orchard for good?"#npc$$829$1#|

"Those dastardly Beetles have nearly ruined our crop entirely. The infestation is no laughing matter."#npc$$821$1#|

"Donny asked you? How could he ask a total stranger to do something so dangerous?"#br##br#
#&53$Bella fumes.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You assure her that you are just fine and that with your skills and expertise, fending off the Fruit Beetles was an easy feat.##char$$821$0#

"I guess you already know about the situation at the Orchard. What a mess."#br##br#
#&53$She sighs.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Bella exactly what happened.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Putting the Fruit Beetles aside for a moment... A pack of tanuki have wreaked havoc on our crops. They're getting so very bold! They come to the orchard and steal whatever fruit they can find. If we don't gather it all quickly enough, it gets snatched away."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"We have to depend on my husband to drive them away. No one else nearby can help."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

"I really don't know where the tanuki come from, but when I see them stealing fruit, by the time I run over, they've scattered."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Though you got rid of the Beetles and Tanuki - at least for now - I'm still a little worried. We were never able to drive them away in the past."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"I want to discuss the plan you proposed with my husband. Perhaps I can get him to see your perspective. In the meantime, could you make a few rounds at the Orchard?#npc$$821$1#

"Ah, I've got it! We'll send %n% off to find Perry with your specialty dish!" #npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Puzzled, you ask about the dish.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Vance##br#
"When he first came to the Helonia Coast, we helped him for a while. He stayed with us on the Orchard, and he fell in love with Bella's cooking. You'd have to be made of stone not to!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"He's just wild for my specialty! Just bring him Spicy Apple Escargot and he'll know we support you."#M006020$Bella$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask how you can help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Vance##br#
"It would help tremendously if you could head to the Emeralden Mountains to the north to get some Emeralden Snail Meat, then go to the Helonia Mountain Cave in the north and help us gather back some Helonia Mountain Mushrooms. Then, just let Bella do her magic in the kitchen!"#npc$$821$1#|
10472|#&7$Bella##br#
"This dish is the only thing that can convince Perry."#br##br#
#&53$Bella smiles jovially.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"You can find the Emeralden Snails in the Emeralden Mountains north of the Orchard. You may have to travel a ways before you encounter them. Be careful; the Helonia Mountain Cave is a dangerous place."#npc$$821$1#|
10473|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the Emeralden Snail you have captured to Bella.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Bella##br#
"The ingredients in this dish are quite complex, but the freshness of the Emeralden Snail makes all the difference."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"The Mountain Mushrooms are also critical to the delicious, savory flavor of the dish."#npc$$821$1#|
10474|Vance's family decides to reveal the Alchemist's whereabouts; they ask you to bring him one of Bella's special dishes to prove that they support you. 

Go to the Emeralden Mountains and hunt some tasty Emeralden Snails. Afterward, head to the Helonia Mountain Cave to gather Mountain Mushrooms.|
10481|#&7$Bella##br#
"Now that all of the ingredients have been collected, we ought to start getting some spices and seasonings."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"This dish requires a wide variety of spices to bring out its complex flavors. I will take care of most of the spices, but I need you to collect two items from the Orchard for me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Some Chili Trees grow in the Orchard. Perry likes spicy dishes, so would you please get more Chilies for me? Also, you'll find several Old Apple Trees in the Orchard. Shake the tree a bit, and gather a few apples."#npc$$821$1#|
10482|#&7$Bella##br#
"Now that you mention it, it's been a while since I last made Spicy Apple Escargot. It's just as tasty as it sounds!"#br##br#
#&53$Bella hums to herself, content, as she prepares the seasonings.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Did you bring me the Chilies and Apples?"#npc$$821$1#|
10483|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You count out the Chilies and Apples carefully. After double checking your numbers, you give the items to Bella.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Now we have everything. I'll take it from here."#br##br#
#&53$She rolls up her sleeves with a grin. It looks like you are in for quite a show!##npc$$821$1#|
10484|Bella needs you to collect some of the crops in the Orchard so she can make her famous Spicy Apple Escargot. 

Collect some Apples and Chili Peppers from the Orchard.|
10491|#&7$Bella##br#
"Sorry to keep you waiting. You ready to get Spicy Apple Escargot-ed?!"#br##br#
#&53$Bella asks with a confident grin.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take the dish from Bella. It smells zesty and, well, very snail-like.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% comes closer to take a look, but quickly retreats.##pet$$1011$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"You haven't really had Spicy Apple Escargot until you've tried mine. Perry's gonna love this,"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
"Well, %n%, I think it's time to say goodbye for now. We support your decision, and after Perry eats this tasty meal, I'm sure he'll loosen up a bit."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bella##br#
#&53$Bella gives you a carefully wrapped package of Spicy Apple Escargot.##br##br#
"Perry should still be near the Megalith Site. Deliver this dish to him before it gets cold."#br##br#
#&53$Bella pats your shoulder warmly.##npc$$821$1#|
10492|#&7$Perry##br#
"Who are you? I've never seen you before."#npc$$821$1#|
10493|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You describe the counterattack plan against the pirates to Perry. You also ask him to make some fake gold to lure the greedy pirates.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"How do you know about that? Who told you about it? I knew I couldn't trust anyone from Helonia for long!"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"I don't want anything to do with that blasted town, and I certainly don't want to get involved with those pirates. I'm staying out of it!"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Perry that Vance and his family have asked you to come to him. You give him Bella's irresistible Spicy Apple Escargot.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"That... that smell... can it be... Bella's famous Spicy Apple Escargot!"#br##br#
#&53$Perry's hardened face immediately softens into a grin. He slurps up a snail with utter glee.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Because Vance and his wife asked you to come here, and because they've done so much for me... and because you've brought these delectable snails... I'll help you out. I'll make the gold, but I don't want any part in the rest of the plan."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You reassure Perry that other than you, the Orchard family, and the Town Mayor, no other townsfolk would know his identity.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Perry nods, then eagerly shoves more snails into his mouth, which is honestly pretty gross. You force a warm smile.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Humans are weird! They know what disgusting creatures Emeralden Snails are, but they scarf 'em down regardless!"#pet$$824$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Let's get started. I'll need your help to collect the materials to make the gold." #npc$$821$1#|
10494|Bella places the finishing touches on her Spicy Apple Escargot and asks you to deliver them to Perry while they are still hot. 

Give the Spicy Apple Fried Escargot to the wandering hunter, Perry.|
10501|#&7$Perry##br#
"We need some catalysts to quicken the process. Could you please go to the Mountain Path to the west of Windwhisper Meadow? There, you'll find a good deal of Helonia Cliff Golems and Giant Golems."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Get some powder from them; it will make the process go much faster, and we don't have much time."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"You're pretty lucky, actually. You can't find this powder just anywhere!"#npc$$821$1#|
10502|#&7$Perry##br#
"Helonia Cliff Golems and Giant Golems are extremely large. You should see them as soon as you enter the western part of the Windwhisper Meadow. Keep in mind that we need the Catalyst Powder and nothing more."#npc$$821$1#|
10503|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the Catalyst Powder to Perry.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"This will prove extremely useful. It usually takes a few days to concoct the fool's gold."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"However, now that we have our hands on Catalyst Powder, we can speed up the chemical reactions and create the faux gold faster."#npc$$821$1#|
10504|Perry needs the Catalyst Powder to speed up the production of fake gold. 

Collect Catalyst Powder from the Helonia Cliff Golems and Giant Golems.|
10511|#&7$Perry##br#
"There are many ways to make fake gold, but the best way is to refine it directly from natural elements."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"However, we don't have much time. I need to get to work."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Perry you will collect the materials for him.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Take the Iron Pickaxe with you, and dig up some Metal Ore. It may be rough on the surface, but with a little elbow grease, I'll have it gleaming like gold."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Use caution and try to collect the larger pieces whenever possible."#npc$$826$1#|
10512|#&7$Perry##br#
"Did you get the Metal Ore? You'll have to use the Iron Pickaxe to get it. Don't even think about just using your hands; you'll get nowhere fast."#npc$$821$1#|
10513|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Metal Ore to Perry. He examines it carefully.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"This stuff isn't half bad. It should be easy enough to pass it off as a precious metal."#npc$$821$1#|
10514|To lead the Pirates into the trap, you have to find Metal Ore that Perry could transform into fool's gold. 

Use the Pickaxe to dig up some Shiny Metal Ore from the rocks.|
10521|#&7$Perry##br#
"I bet you're wondering how I can make this ordinary Metal Ore look like precious metal."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"The Pirates are going to examine this ore closely. They're pretty sharp when it comes to treasure and won't be easily fooled. I need to apply a special kind of powder to the surface of the metal, like a paint."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"I'll polish the Metal Ore while you whip up a batch of the special paint."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Keep in mind that to give the paint the proper texture, you'll need Budding Flower Pollen and Honey Flower Pollen. Both can be obtained from a Budding Flower Dryads and Honey Flower Dryads, respectively."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"When you get the two materials, mix them together according to my formula. You'll get a final product of Shiny Gold Powder, which is precisely what I need."#npc$$821$1#|
10522|#&7$Perry##br#
"This formula is indeed more complicated. I will tell you again, but you must commit it to memory,"#br##br#
#&53$Perry instructs firmly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"To create Shiny Gold Powder, you need both Budding Flower Pollen and Honey Flower Pollen. You can get them from the Flower Dryads who wander near Windwhisper Meadow. Concoct the Powder by following the formula with which I've provided you."#npc$$821$1#|
10523|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After using the pollen to create Shiny Gold Powder, you hand your concoction to Perry.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Very good. I knew I could count on you to get this done. Let's take a look."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Not bad, kid! Thumbs up."#npc$$821$1#|
10524|To make the fake treasure look real, Perry needs you to get some Shiny Gold Powder and bring it back to him. 

Look for the Flower Dryads near Windwhisper Meadow. Collect their Pollen and use it to make Shiny Gold Powder.|
10531|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Perry meticulously polishes the ore and applies the gold powder with a tiny brush.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"I never thought I'd make fool's gold again. I used to do it quite frequently in Helonia. Selena must've told her mother about me."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$When you hear Perry mention Selena, the Town Mayor's daughter, you gasp, shocked. Instantly you ask him how he knows Selena; does he know where she is?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"So she left home? She seemed pretty unhappy as of late. She used to come confide in me once in a while."#br##br#
#&53$Perry gives you a helpless shrug.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"A few days ago, I saw her walking toward a house in Windwhisper Meadow. The house is located to the north, not far from here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"If you are concerned about her safety, why don't you check on the house while I finish this up?"#npc$$821$1#|
10532|#&7$Perry##br#
"Painting all of these little pieces is no easy task."#br##br#
#&53$Perry squints, carefully brushing on the gold powder.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Did you take a look at the cottage to the north? Is Selena still in there?"#npc$$821$1#|
10533|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Perry about the Pirates surrounding the cottage.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"That's awful. If they managed to kidnap Selena..."#br##br#
#&53$Perry trails off and looks away, his brow furrowed.##npc$$828$1#|
10534|Perry informs you that he saw Selena heading alone toward a cottage in the north of Windwhisper Meadow. Perhaps you could find her there.

Go to the Cottage in the north of Windwhisper Meadow.|
10541|#&7$Perry##br#
"Before Madeline's husband passed away, Madeline and her entire family lived in that cottage."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"I often see Selena going back to the cottage alone, still mourning her father. I think she finds some comfort there. Once in a while, she'd come talk to me, too."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"Now that the Pirates occupy the cottage, I'm willing to bet they've abducted Selena. There's no time to stand around pondering the possibilities. Let's catch a pirate and milk him for information."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, but %p% looks hesitant.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"..."#pet$$1$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"I know this seems rather sudden, but we cannot just walk away from this. Selena could be hurt - or even killed."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
"I have a Tranquilizer Blowdart designed to knock out small animals. One dart will knock a Pirate unconscious. After he passes out, bring 'em back in the Cloth Bag and we'll get him to tell us everything he knows."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take the Tranquilizer from Perry and ask %p% if it has something to say.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I'm just a little bit confused. It sounds like that cottage has gone vacant for a long time, so why would the girl go there?"#pet$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You sigh. Issues involving emotions are difficult for %p% to grasp, and there is no simple explanation.##char$$809:0$0#|
10542|#&7$Perry##br#
"What's wrong with Madeline? It didn't occur to her that Selena would return to that cottage? Madeline doesn't understand her daughter at all."#npc$$828$1#|
10543|#&7$Perry##br#
"Looks like this guy is totally clueless. He's snoring like an asthmatic camel. We'll find out what he knows soon enough!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Perry##br#
#&53$Perry deliberately raises his voice, trying to rouse the passed out Pirate.##npc$$821$1#|
10544|Pirates took over the Cottage in Windwhisper Meadow. Perry wants you to capture one of the Pirates, hoping he can pump him for information about Selena's whereabouts. 

Use a Tranquilizer Blowdart to knock out the Pirate, then bring the unconscious Pirate back in the Cloth Bag for further interrogation.|
10551|#&7$Perry##br#
"Hope you had sweet dreams. Now wake up!"#br##br#
#&53$Perry barks angrily.##M111010$Perry$826$1#

#&7$Catseye Porter##br#
"Boss? Huh? Who are you? What... what're you doing to me?"#M122020$Catseye Porter$823$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"We're not planning to do anything at the moment. But that could change very soon. Where is the girl from the Cottage? If you don't tell us..."#br##br#
#&53$A bone-chilling, eerie grin spreads across Perry's face.##M111010$Perry$821$1#

#&7$Catseye Porter##br#
"Please! I'll tell you everything. Just don't hurt me! I was just going along with the Adjutant Follower's orders! We were supposed to loot the Cottage. He then ordered us to take the girl to the Main Camp,"#br##br#
#&53$Catseye Porter explains, sweating profusely.##M122020$Catseye Porter$823$0#

#&7$Catseye Porter##br#
"I swear, I'm telling the truth. The Adjutant Follower is still in the Cottage. You can ask him if you don't believe me."#M122020$Catseye Porter$821$0#

#&7$Perry##br#
"%n%, did you hear that? Looks like you'll have to return to the Cottage to verify this news with the Adjutant Follower. If it's all true, let Madeline know immediately."#M111010$Perry$821$1#|
10552|#&7$Madeline##br#
"%n%, you've returned at last. I have heard about your interactions with Vance. Were you able to get the gold bait?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"We still can't find Selena. Do you know anything about my daughter's whereabouts? I'm getting worried about her."#npc$$821$1#|
10553|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Madeline the whole story.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"How can this be?! No... my poor Selena... Those dastardly Pirates kidnapped her?! I... I have to do something! But what!?"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Madeline breaks into sobs. You try to comfort her as best you can, telling her to pull herself together so you can put your plan into action and find Selena.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"You're absolutely right. This plan might help me get my daughter back. After the pirates are lured away, the Catseye Lair's guard will be down and we can go in and rescue my baby."#npc$$821$1#|
10554|You learn from the Pirate that Selena has been taken to the Black Bandit Headquarters. It's not good news, but Madeline has a right to know. 

Tell Madeline that Pirates have kidnapped Selena.|
10561|#&7$Madeline##br#
"With everyone's help, we managed to get everything we need to launch this counterattack. There are some dangerous tasks that we still must accomplish, though. I've been discussing the issue with the townspeople."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Braeden will to go to Silverash Shores to set up the bomb. You will then sneak into the camp, disguised as a townsperson, and tell the pirates that treasures have washed ashore."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and tell her you will proceed according to the plan.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"No, wait, %n%. You're the most skilled hero I know. Will you go into Catseye Lair and save my daughter while the pirates are lured ashore?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You know you'll have to take on this difficult task, but it will mean one less person transporting fake gold into the Lair.##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I'll talk to the townsfolk. Someone else will surely transport the gold."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"We must set traps on the East Sea Coast. However, before setting any traps, we have to drive away the Mollusks near the coastal line. Otherwise, they'll trigger our traps before the Pirates do."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"After you drive the Mollusks away from the beach, notify Braeden and he'll begin preparations for the next phase."#npc$$821$1#|
10562|#&7$Braeden##br#
"%n%, you've returned at last. The Town Mayor told me you planned to drive the Mollusks away from the coastal line. How did it go? Are you okay?"#npc$$821$1#|
10563|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Braeden about having driven away the Mollusks and suggest he get started on his plan. You also tell him that you plan to save the Town Mayor's daughter, reminding him that someone else will have to transport the fool's gold.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Saving a life is our highest priority, and it's true; no one except you has the skill to carry out the rescue mission successfully."#npc$$828$1#|
10564|You need to help Madeline rescue her daughter, but without you, the rebellion plan will be short one person. Madeline hopes that you can head to the beach and get rid of the Mollusks. In the meantime, she will continue preparing. 

Get rid of the Seaweed Mollusks and Sandy Mollusks on Silverash Shores.|
10571|#&7$Braeden##br#
"I can't think of anyone who would be willing to send the fake gold to the Pirates Stronghold. It's incredibly risky,"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"I'll do it,"#br##br#
#&53$Isaac suddenly pipes up, walking toward you.##M003030$Isaac$3001$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"I'll transport the fake gold. I've already talked to the Town Mayor. It'll be a piece of cake."#M003030$Isaac$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Brother? But... but... this is a dangerous operation!"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"True. But I want to help. I need to help."#br##br##&53$He nods sharply.##M003030$Isaac$823$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"%n%, will you help me once again? A group of Raging Sand Crabs lurk at the northern end of Silverash Shore. If Braeden sets up bombs there, they may attack him. I'd like you to help me get rid of these Sand Crabs."#M003030$Isaac$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"With our combined abilities, we can work together to complete this mission."#M003030$Isaac$821$0##&PP00302#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod briskly and leave the brothers to discuss details of the plan. You hope they will work together well... your life may just depend upon it.##char$$821$0#|
10572|#&7$Madeline##br#
"How could things change like this?"#npc$$821$1#|
10573|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Madeline that you've cleared the beach.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Thank you. I'm quite surprised that Isaac joined the operation. Our plan now depends on the brothers."#npc$$821$1#|
10574|Isaac agrees to take part in the plan, but he fears that Sand Crabs on the shore might attack Braeden as he carries out his task. Therefore, he asks you to drive away the Sand Crabs.  

Rid the Silverash Shores of the Raging Sand Crabs.|
10581|#&7$Madeline##br#
"%n%, you have been a great help to us during this period of hardship. If everything goes according to our plan, Braeden has already set traps near the coastal line. Take this opportunity to rest a bit."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You express concerns about Braeden to Madeline and ask if she has heard from him.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I understand your concern, but if I tell you too much, you'll never be able to rest. You desperately need a break, or you'll burn out. Take heart that everything's gone smoothly so far."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$*After accepting the quest, you will assume Braeden's identity and carry out quests using his identity.#|
10582|#&7$Madeline##br#
"Setting the traps shouldn't be a problem for Braeden..."#npc$$828$1#|
10583|#&7$Madeline##br#
I have no doubt Braeden will return safe and sound. You needn't worry about him."#M115010$Madeline$828$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Ah, see? He's returned unharmed! You are unharmed, aren't you, Braeden?"#br##br#
#&53$Madeline smiles tentatively.##M115010$Madeline$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you watch Braeden walk towards you, you breathe a sigh of relief.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"%n%, thank you for clearing the Mollusks and Sand Crabs off the beach. They would have made setting the traps much more difficult."#M003010$Braeden$821$1#|
10584|Braeden is tasked to set traps on the shore.

"%n%, the plan is now being carried out, but even if it succeeds, our town will still need more defense supplies."#br##br#
#&53$Madeline knits her brow, concerned.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"We're going to need outside reinforcements, and our facilities must be strengthened as well. I've already asked someone to do a few of the tasks, but I was hoping someone else could help fill any blanks for me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Could you ask Luther to come over? He thinks more clearly than I do and often has good suggestions. Things will run more smoothly with his help." #npc$$825$1#|

"Ah, Luther. He's stubborn as a mule. There's nothing I can do to stop him. Let him do what he wants and I will include his plan in our grand scheme."#npc$$821$1#|
10594|Madeline wants you to ask Luther to help with further defense work in the town. Luther is a level-headed and reliable young man, and Madeline trusts him. 

Meet Luther, and ask him to assist Madeline.|
10595|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You go to speak to Luther, but notice that he is hurriedly packing up his backpack.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"%n%, I'm glad you're here. I was gonna leave a note, but it's easier if I just tell you what's happening."#br##br#
#&53$Luther sighs sadly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Surprised, you ask Luther where he is going.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Since I heard that Selena went missing, I've been searching for her. I never considered that pirates could have kidnapped her."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Since I learned about the abduction, I've spent every waking moment thinking about how to rescue Selena. I cannot imagine the horrors she's living right now."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I can't just sit around, twiddling my thumbs. When Isaac lures the Pirates out, I'll use the opportunity to sneak into the Catseye Lair to look for Selena."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"It is my responsibility to look after Selena, and I've failed her. I couldn't bear to talk of my failures with Madeline. Could you tell her my decision?"#npc$$821$1#|
10601|#&7$Madeline##br#
"According to the plan, Isaac should be back soon."#br##br#
#&53$A grim look crosses Madeline's face.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Madeline about Isaac's condition; has any new information been reported?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Isaac's plan to deliver phony treasures to the Pirates Camp has been underway for a little while now. From what we last heard, he should be back soon. I'm a bit concerned, as I haven't seen any sign of him since."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Madeline about everything that has happened so you can determine a way to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"You're right. You're the only one who can help now."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$*After accepting the quest, you will assume Isaac's identity and carry out quests using his identity.#|
10602|#&7$Madeline##br#
"I am really concerned about Isaac's condition. The last time he contacted me was not long after he set out..."#npc$$821$1#|
10603|#&7$Madeline##br#
"Will Isaac be okay? Since he was a little boy, he has been so docile and tender. And now, this sweet young man volunteers to head into the Pirate Camp? It really worries me."#M115010$Madeline$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You spot Isaac from afar. You wave to him, gesturing for him to come closer.##char$$801:71$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Madeline, %n%, I just got back. I was going to visit Braeden. Is he okay? Are his wounds deep?"#br##br#
#&53$Isaac's thoughts are on his brother.##M003030$Isaac$828$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"After receiving medical attention for the lacerations, Braeden is just fine. It takes time for wounds to heal, so it's better for him to be at home resting for the time being."#M115010$Madeline$825$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Very good. As for me, I delivered the fake treasure, and darned if I don't feel great about putting one over on those Pirates!"#M003030$Isaac$826$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"So the plan worked?"#M115010$Madeline$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"It went more smoothly than I could have imagined. The Pirates are too foolish or too greedy to see the consequences of their actions."#M003030$Isaac$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Madeline, I took the route of the coastal line to come here. Along the way, I witnessed the Pirates searching the beach. They scattered, utterly panicked, when the bomb went off."#M003030$Isaac$821$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I think that's your cue, %n%."#br##br#
#&53$Madeline and Isaac look at you.##M115010$Madeline$821$1#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"%n%, we need you to finish this."#M003030$Isaac$821$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Excuse me for a moment. I need to check on my brother."#br##br#
#&53$Isaac nods firmly to you before stepping away.##M003030$Isaac$823$0#|
10604|Isaac plans to bring fake treasures to the Pirate Camp to lure the Pirates away from their camp. They will then walk straight into Braeden's traps. 

Disguise yourself as Isaac to pull a cart full of fool's gold through the Pirate Camp.|
10607|I found some treasure on the shore!|
10608|You disguise yourself as Isaac to carry out the quest. (Lv19. Spreading False Information)|
10609|Now is not the time for you to disguise yourself as Isaac. 
(You must accept quest: Lv19 Spreading False Information.)|
10611|#&7$Madeline##br#
#&53$Madeline watches Isaac leave, her brow furrowed with anxiety.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"I'm worried about Luther. Since he was a little boy, he's adored Selena. He cares for Selena with all his heart; everything he does is for her."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"He volunteered to sneak into the Pirate Lair. I know his heart is true; he's risking life and limb to save her. If she returns safe and sound with Luther, I think I could entrust him with her... forever."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"You should head into the Lair to meet with Luther, but watch out for Catseye Trainers and their nasty parrots. They're very perceptive, and I fear they could blow Luther's cover."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Before you and Luther meet up, knock out the Catseye Trainers and the Catseye Parrots or you risk having your identity revealed to the Pirates."#npc$$821$1#|
10612|#&7$Luther##br#
"Shh! %n%, keep your voice down. Several Trainers passed through with their blasted birds and they almost revealed my true identity."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"We have to figure out a way to get rid of them or those blabbermouth parrots will expose us."#npc$$821$1#|
10613|#&7$Luther##br#
"%n%, here, here!"#br##br#
#&53$A man who looks like a pirate stops you in your tracks.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$When you look closer, you realize it is Luther, dressed impeccably as a Pirate.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Did I scare you? Disguising myself with different clothes and wigs comes naturally to me. How'd your part of the plan go?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform him that the plan has been going well thus far and you've taken out Catseye Trainers and Parrots on your way.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Not long ago, I saw a bunch of Pirates heading back to their Lair from the beach. Most were wounded, but they didn't even bandage their cuts and bruises. On the contrary, they waited to get to the Lair for any sort of treatment. Odd, eh?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You agree with Luther. Something is fishy. However, it seems the Lair is not under heavy surveillance, so it is a good opportunity to sneak in.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"This deserves further investigation. Let's assign tasks. Let me think..."#br##br#
#&53$Luther mulls it over.##npc$$821$1#|
10614|Madeline wants you to go into the Pirate Lair to support Luther, but she fears your arrival might arouse suspicion. Thus, she asks you to take out the Catseye Trainers and Catseye Parrots first. 

Before meeting up with Luther, stun the Catseye Trainers and Catseye Parrots.|
10621|#&7$Luther##br#
"We need to collect some information. If we hope to rescue Selena sooner rather than later, we've got to split up."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Here's my plan. Let me see what I can learn from the Pirates. I'll try to get information on Selena's whereabouts, but I'll also see what other dirt I can dig up."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Meanwhile, you should come up with a rough map of the camp. If you discover any precious belongings the Pirates plundered, mark their locations on the map. Hopefully, we can snatch all the valuables back and return them to their rightful owners."#npc$$821$1#|
10622|#&7$Luther##br#
"Don't worry about me. I'm a merchant with the gift of gab. I can talk anyone into buying anything, so prying some information out of the Pirates should be easy as pie."#br##br#
#&53$Luther grins with confidence.##npc$$825$1#|
10623|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the map to Luther and share what you have learned about the area.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"They're loading goods into the boxes?"#br##br#
#&53$Luther scowls. He hasn't learned about that, apparently.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I haven't located Selena, and time is running out. We have to act fast."#npc$$821$1#|
10624|Luther wants you to draw up a map of the Pirate Lair. 

Fill out the Blank Map Paper with a complete map of the Pirate Lair.|
10631|#&7$Luther##br#
"After we save Selena, we have to destroy the Pirate Lair. I've got a few bombs leftover from Braeden. We just need to place them strategically near their most important areas."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I retrieved a piece of interesting information from the Pirates. To claim sovereignty here, they've put up banners from the Catseye Pirate Crew in front of their most important buildings."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"They've done us the favor of marking all of their facilities for us!"#br##br#
#&53$Luther grins.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"You scouted the Lair, so you're probably more familiar with it than I am. Bring some Charcoal Pencils with you when you go to the Lair. Draw a mark on the banners in front of the important areas."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Catseye Conjurers will use magic to prevent the Lair from being raided, so we need to find a way to get rid of them and take their staves."#npc$$821$1#|
10632|#&7$Luther##br#
"I have to move faster, too. I've got to find Selena before it's too late."#br##br#
#&53$Luther wrings his hands together.##npc$$828$1#|
10633|#&7$Luther##br#
#&53$Luther snatches the staff from your hand and throws it aside.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$One by one, you point out each location on the map to Luther.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Ah, I see!"#npc$$821$1#|
10634|Luther plans to place bombs around the camp, so he asks you to mark the most important locations on your map. Said areas are indicated by Pirate Flags. However, to avoid the detection magic of the Catseye Conjurers, he asks you to first steal their Staffs. 

Steal the Conjurer's Staff and use the Charcoal Pencil to mark important locations, indicated by Pirate Flags, on the Map.|
10641|#&7$Luther##br#
"%n%, I am honored to execute this plan with you. Our next step is the key to the entire scheme."#br##br#
#&53$Luther cracks his knuckles.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"First, I'll find Selena. Once I have her by my side, we'll plant the bombs together, then leave this horrible place."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I won't be able to place bombs right under a bunch of Pirates' noses, so I need you to distract them for me."#br##br#
#&53$Luther scratches his head as he thinks.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I will also need you to launch an attack on the Pirates to cause a commotion. That'll give Selena and I time to set up the bombs."#npc$$821$1#|
10642|#&7$Luther##br#
"Set out when you're ready. I'll figure out the best time to go in and place the bombs."#br##br#
#&53$Luther nods decisively.##npc$$821$1#|
10643|#&7$%n%##br#
You rush back to the meeting point and realize Luther doesn't seem as though he is in a rush.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Oh, Selena."#br##br#
#&53$Luther sighs, his shoulders sagging.##npc$$821$1#|
10644|Luther wants you to launch an attack on the Pirate Lair to create a distraction. He will then take advantage of the chaos to set bombs at the locations marked on the map. 

Launch an attack on the Catseye Defenders and Catseye Pirates.|
10651|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Luther's eyes are cast down, his shoulders slumped.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"%n%, I discovered the whereabouts of the Pirate Leader, and I found Selena."#br##br#
#&53$Luther seems drained of energy.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I... I can't. In the future, maybe you'll understand."#br##br#
#&53$He avoids looking directly at you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I'm relying on you to finish this mission. I just don't know how to feel anymore. I'm exhausted. I... I need to go back to Helonia."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Luther about Selena's condition, then inquire about how much time is left until the bomb goes off.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I didn't set up the bombs. Bring this order to the Catseye Herald and you'll find the truth."#npc$$821$1#|
10652|#&7$Selena##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
10653|#&7$Selena##br#
"Stop! Don't hurt Mac!"#br##br#
#&53$Selena shouts angrily.##M004040$Selena$826$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"Mac, are you okay?"#M004040$Selena$821$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"I'm fine. Don't worry. It seems this adventurer has come from town. I won't let anyone take you from me,"#br#
#&53$Mac growls.##M145010$Mac$823$0#

#&7$Mac##br#
"Selena, you and the others get on board first. Leave the rest to me. I won't let anything happen to you."#M145011$Mac$2$0#|
10654|Luther suddenly backtracks on the attack plan and leaves the Pirate Lair dejectedly. Before he does, he halfheartedly tells you the location of the Pirate Leader. 

Find the Catseye Herald and deliver the Orders to him to draw out the Pirate Leader.|
10655|#&7$Catseye Herald##br#
"Secret order? I've never heard of any such thing. Show it to me."#npc$$821$1##br#


#&53$*Choose "Give the Secret Order to Catseye Herald" from the Dialogue options.#|

10661|#&7$Selena##br#
"I beg you, don't hurt Mac. Can't you understand? I wasn't kidnapped!"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"No one forced me to come here. I came of my own volition. No one here has hurt me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"I am in love with Mac. I want to sail the seas with him. I want to be his navigation officer. I just want to pursue my dreams, to let salty ocean air sting my nose, to live a life of adventure. Is that so much to ask?"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
#&53$Selena holds out a key.##br##br#
"This is the key to the Treasure Vault. All of the treasure collected from our town is locked inside. Mac plans to return all the plundered items back to the townsfolk."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"If you still don't believe me, ask Mac himself!"#npc$$821$1#|
10662|#&7$Mac##br#
#&53$Mac grips his weapon tightly, staring you down.##M145010$Mac$1001$1#|
10663|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Mac confirms what Selena has told you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mac##br#
#&53$Mac relaxes a bit.##br##br#
"What she told you is true. We are desperately in love. I never asked her to leave her family. She offered."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"My men like her quite a bit and they regard her as part of the crew. She's beloved among us. No one would dare harm a hair on her head."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"I have given the key to the Treasure Vault to Selena. The treasures belong to the townsfolk of Helonia, so I will return it all to them."#npc$$821$1#|
10664|Selena stops you and makes it clear that she came to the Pirate Lair of her own free will. She tells you to ask Mac to confirm her story. 

Ask Pirate Leader Mac about the whole thing.|

#&7$Bluto##br#
"Mac, think this over! You can't be stupid about this. Not all of us want to see the crew disbanded."#br##br#
#&53$Bluto steps out from behind Mac and Selena, tense and grim-faced.##M126031$Bluto$3001$0#

#&7$Mac##br#
"Bluto, I'm in charge here, and the decision has already been made. Now is not the time to be talking about this."#br##br#
#&53$Mac stands firm, narrowing his eyes at Bluto.##M145010$Mac$826$1#

#&7$Bluto##br#
"Heh, I don't care about your decisions and I'm not here to talk. I'm here to take what is ours - the key to the treasure vault."#M126030$Bluto$821$0#

#&7$Mac##br#
"You dare...!" #M145010$Mac$1$1#

#&7$Bluto##br#
"If you don't give me that key, I have enough followers to help me take more from Helonia. One way or another, I will get what is owed to me."#M126030$Bluto$826$0#

#&7$Mac##br#
"So you were the one that sent part of our crew to harass the town! Bluto, you traitor!"#M145010$Mac$826$1#

#&7$Bluto##br#
"Just shut up and give me the key!"#br##br#
#&53$Bluto glares at Selena.##M126031$Bluto$821$0#

#&7$Selena##br#
"You're stupid if you think I'll just hand it over to you!"#M004040$Selena$826$1#

#&7$Bluto##br#
"Then I'll just have to take it by force!"#M126031$Bluto$101$0#

#&7$Bluto##br#
#&53$With surprising speed and agility, Bluto brandishes his axe as he rushes towards Selena, raising his weapon to strike...##M126031$Bluto$2011$0#

"So you're the one who wrecked my plans over and over again! You will pay for this!"#M126031$Bluto$1001$0#

"It may not be an ideal ending, but at least she's safe and happy. Thank you, %n%, for everything... Remember when you asked me to loan you the Starlight Treasure Chest? Give me a moment."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Donny##br#
"%n%, don't go!"#br##br#
#&53$Donny, the young boy from Bella's Orchard, rushes in, breathless.##M001020$Donny$101$1#

#&7$Vance##br#
"No matter what I say, this kid insists on coming here to say goodbye to you. Bella is at home, watching over things."#br##br#
#&53$Orchard Master Vance enters with a warm smile.##M005030$Vance$3001$1#

#&7$Donny##br#
"%n% is so awesome, making all those pirates go away! When I grow up , I want to be just like %n%!"#M001020$Donny$824$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"You have some big shoes to fill, Donny. If you want to become as brave and strong as %n%, you'll have to work and train hard every day."#br##br#
#&53$No one reacts as the fisherman brothers enter the scene.##M003010$Braeden$3001$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"Well, %n%, it's about time I express my gratitude to you, so thanks for giving me back my courage."#br##br#
#&53$Isaac poorly maintains a stoic attitude.##M003030$Isaac$829$1#

#&7$Braeden##br#
"Brother, because of your courage, we all agree that you should be the one to represent the town in thanking %n%, but here you are, getting all emotional!"#M003010$Braeden$826$0#

#&7$Isaac##br#
"A man is capable of feeling this moved, you know! Anyway, %n%, on behalf of Helonia, thank you for all that you've done."#M003030$Isaac$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After being so graciously thanked, you wave to the townsfolk around you in gratitude, but your mind is on the Starlight Treasure Chest and how you could unlock it. At least their kindness keeps you in a good mood.##char$$807: 82$0#

#&7$Madeline##br#
"Oh, %n%, about the key to the Starlight Treasure Chest...It has been passed down from generation to generation among the Lunarin chiefs. I suggest you pay Lunarin chief Omar a visit."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, very eager to get to Crescent Hill. Perhaps there you can finally separate yourself from your Eidolon. Then you catch yourself, guiltily stealing a glance at %p%.##char$$806: 0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I can sense your thoughts sometimes. Don't worry, I... I understand."#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I know that without a strong will, a human with an Eidolon may be consumed by its power. I know you don't want to become a zombie, so you must separate yourself from me before that happens."#pet$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You open your mouth to speak, but %p% interrupts you.##char$$809: 0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It's time to go."#pet$$101$1#|
10692|#&7$Omar##br#
"If you've nothing important to attend to, please leave the village as soon as possible."#npc$$821$1#|
10693|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you pass by, you can't help but notice a young woman sighing deeply. She seems so preoccupied with her worries that she hardly notices you approach.##char$$101$0#

#&7$Sue##br#
"All these years we've lived in peace... Why'd everything have to pick NOW to futz up? If things go on like this, can we even perform the ceremony?" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You couldn't help asking her if she's feeling okay.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sue##br#
"Buh- What? Did you hear all that? You look like some kind of traveler, am I right?" #br##br#
"I guess that's why you don't know - we're having troubles with this year's ceremony. It's -THE- event in Lunarin Village." #npc$$821$1#|
10694|Madeline gave you the Starlight Treasure Chest, but the key is held by Omar, the village chief of Lunarin. If you want to open the Treasure Chest, you'll need to borrow the key from Omar. 

Bring the Starlight Treasure Chest to Omar and ask to borrow the key.|
10695|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You find Lunarin chief Omar and explain to him about your need to borrow the key to the Starlight Treasure Chest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"The key to the Starlight Treasure Chest? How does someone like you know about it?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar eyes you suspiciously and impatiently.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Right now we're preparing for the ceremony, which takes precedence over everything else. An outsider like you will never understand." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"The ceremony will start very soon, but we're still far from finished with preparations. I don't have the time to hear your story."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your heart sinks at Omar's unwelcoming tone; you realize that borrowing the key from Omar will be harder than you thought. All you can do now is hang around in the village and look for other solutions.##char$$828:0$0#|
10701|#&7$Sue##br#
#&53$Sue paces, completely oblivious to your presence. She frowns, her brow furrowing.##br##br#
"If this keeps up, I'll never have all those flowers in time for the ceremony."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You can't help but ask her what happened.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sue##br#
"You're from out of town, so I'm not surprised you don't know, but recently, the wildlife around the village has become really aggressive. Several people have already been hurt."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"When I tried to pick flowers for the ceremony near the village entrance, the Lunar Flower Dryads attacked me in minutes. How am I supposed to prepare for the ceremony when those nasty little buggers keep trying to bite me in the legs?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"If you're planning on heading out that way, you'd better be careful."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Now that you've heard this, you feel compelled to help the people of Lunarin. Who knows - maybe you'll win their favor by cutting down those Lunar Flower Dryads.##char$$821$0#|
10702|#&7$Sue##br#
"The fields on the outskirts of Lunarin are a beautiful, verdant garden, but those nasty Flower Dryads have all but taken it over."#npc$$821$1#|
10703|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain that you've taken the weed whacker to those pesky Lunar Flower Dryads.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sue##br#
#&53$Sue's eyes widen as something falls into place in her brain.##br##br#
"I thought you were just another tourist here to see the ceremony - I didn't know you were a real warrior! This is great!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"Did you come up from the Helonia Coast? I like it there, though I haven't been down to visit in a while."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"Honestly, I was planning to leave the village to study abroad, but so much has happened recently that I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Right now, I'd be glad if the ceremony went off without a hitch."#npc$$821$1#|
10704|Sue explains that the creatures outside of the village recently became aggressive and violent. They've made it nearly impossible for her to gather flowers for the ceremony. You decide to help her. 

Get rid of the Lunar Flower Dryads outside of Lunarin.|
10711|#&7$Sue##br#
"The Crescent Ceremony is Lunarin's most well-known annual event. It's just around the corner now, but the preparations are a real mess."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"Not long ago, Lunarin suffered an attack. My grandpa, Anthony, is still busy fixing all the equipment and facilities that were damaged in the ambush. Meanwhile, my mom's powering ahead full-bore to make sure the ceremony happens, in spite of our recent misfortune."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"You seem strong, and pretty skilled. I think we could use your help. Could you drop by my mom's place and my grandpa's to see how they're doing? Then, let Halton know how things are going; he's in charge of all the prep-work for the ceremony."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"Why did you come to Cresent Hill anyway, if not to see the ceremony? Did you need something from us? Maybe you could ask Halton for help. He's the grandson of the Village Chief, you know."#npc$$821$1#|
10712|#&7$Halton##br#
"I don't know how Anthony's repairs are going. I ought to send someone to help, but right now, we're just so short-handed."#npc$$821$1#|
10713|#&7$Halton##br#
"Ah, you must be %n%. Omar, the Village Chief, is my grandfather. I apologize for any brusqueness he might have shown you; he's under a lot of pressure right now."#npc$$825$1##&PP00401#

#&7$Halton##br#
"The Crescent Ceremony is a beautiful event, but these days, many people no longer value tradition. Some even consider the ceremony more a yearly nuisance than a yearly blessing."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Because the public no longer embraces the ceremony as they once did, my grandfather is becoming more and more stubborn and, frankly, xenophobic. He claims that out-of-towners are bad influences."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"I've heard that you came to Crescent Hill to borrow the key to unlock the Starlight Treasure Chest. Grandfather may not care for strangers, but if I have a talk with him, he may at least let you borrow the key."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"So here's what I'm thinking: You help our town make a beautiful ceremony, and I'll get gramps to let go of that key for an hour or two. You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours!"#npc$$821$1#|
10714|Sue hopes that you can clear the obstacles standing in the way of the ceremony and tells you to look for Halton, who is overseeing the preparations. Meanwhile, Halton, the Village Chief's grandson, thinks he can help you obtain the key to the Starlight Treasure Chest. You need to entrust him with the Starlight Treasure Chest to see what will happen. 

Listen to Anthony and Nala's problems, then go find Halton.|
10715|#&7$Nala##br#
"If you're here to lend a hand, I'm happy to take it! The ceremony is quite important, but we're in a bit of a pickle this year."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"Lunarin is well known for its vivid, fragrant blossoms. The flowers, which we also provide for Navea, are used in great numbers in the Crescent Ceremony."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"The Crescent Ceremony is a festival every year in which we honor the heroes who founded this beautiful town. In the Ritual of Blessings, we sing their praises and ask them to look after us another year."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"However, our flower fields have suddenly been inundated by Flowertraps. They make picking blossoms nearly impossible. As the day of the ceremony approaches, I fear we won't be fully prepared."#npc$$828$1#|
10716|#&7$Anthony##br#
"Each year, my apprentices and I set up the wooden structure for the Crescent Ceremony. It's a complicated process, so we always try to get started on it early."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"We were almost finished preparing for the Ceremony, but a few days ago, a band of Gnomes from the southwest raided our village, wreaking havoc on everything we hold dear."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"Those beastly creatures destroyed a number of ceremonial items and even stole the Ceremonial Vessel."#npc$$821$1#|
10721|#&7$Nala##br#
"Not only have the creatures become violent, but the Birdbrains - typically as dimwitted a creature as you'll ever see - have grown more aggressive, too. If you get close to them, they'll swarm you in a flock."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"We use plumage and flowers in our Crescent Ceremony decorations, but if we can't get close to the Birdbrains, we'll never collect enough feathers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"Sue told me that you chased away the Flower Dryads, so I doubt wrangling a few Birdbrains will be too rough for you. You'll find those foolish fowl frolicking to the northwest of Lunarin."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"Remember to choose only perfect feathers without any split ends; we want the very best for our ceremony."#npc$$821$1#|
10722|#&7$Nala##br#
"We usually just pluck a few feathers directly from each Birdbrain. They roam around to the northwest of the village."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"Look for feathers with a glowing sheen, and avoid the ones with split ends. Only the most perfect plumes are fit for use in the ceremony."#npc$$821$1#|
10723|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the feathers you collected to Nala.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nala##br#
"Perfect! Look at the sheen on these! You really know your plumes from your pinions. With your help, I have my fingers crossed that we can pull of this ceremony without any more complications."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nala##br#
"Now, I'll start weaving the feathers and flowers together with these thin ropes. We'll just have to hope that Halton can retrieve the Ceremonial Vessel before the date of the ceremony."#npc$$1$1#|
10724|Nala explains that the village doesn't have enough feathers to use as decorations for the ceremony. She asks for your help in acquiring more.

Go northwest of Lunarin and obtain Shiny Feathers from Birdbrains or Colorful Birdbrains.|
10731|#&7$Anthony##br#
"%n%, Sue told me you're helping prepare for the ceremony, and gol-dangit, I need all the help I can get."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"There's a type of plant known 'round these parts as Lunar Grass that grows to the northwest of Lunarin. If you grind up the Lunar Grass, you'll get a sticky paste that's almost like glue."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"We often use the paste to patch up broken items, and this'll be much quicker than rebuilding the damaged things from scratch. I need you to go gather some of that grass, then give me the Viscous Juice after you've ground it up." #npc$$821$1#|
10732|#&7$Anthony##br#
"Lunar Grass grows to the northwest of Lunarin. Remember to grind it up nice and good - it's the paste I need, not the grass itself."#npc$$821$1#|
10733|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the thick, foul smelling Viscous Juice to Anthony.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"I feared some of these things would be beyond repair, but the damage is actually fairly minor. With this paste, we can patch 'em up good as new."#npc$$821$1#|
10734|Anthony asks you to collect some Lunar Grass, grind it into juice, and give it to him. 

Go northwest of Lunarin, collect the Lunar Grass, and grind it into Viscous Juice.|
10741|#&7$Anthony##br#
"I heard about how you dealt with those Flower Dryads and the Birdbrain flock. You're the real deal, aren'tcha?"#br##br#
#&53$Anthony gives you a once over, nodding slowly.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"Now I'm thinkin', who'd win if you and ol' Potter had a go at it?  You ought to challenge him! Wouldn't that be a sight, heh!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shake your head, not really sure what Anthony is thinking. What if innocent villagers got hurt What if more things got broken? Things do seem to break a lot when you're around...##char$$807:80$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Hah! Don't underestimate me, or the town doc'll spend a week puttin' you back together! So, this is the traveler, Anthony?"#br##br#
#&53$Potter sizes you up. You have no idea where he came from.##M110010$Potter$3001$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You apologize to Potter and point to %p%. You explain that your Eidolon thinks and acts on its own, so a fight would be unpredictable.##char$$828:71$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Taaaaar-nation, I need some exercise!"#br##br#
#&53$Potter begins shadowboxing, throwing swift punches into the air.##M110010$Potter$824$1#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"You let me know when you're ready, %n%. Ah, I'll bet that Halton boy would pay to see this."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I understand. Just don't hurt him for real, alright?"#br##br#
#&53$%p% looks at you, awaiting your response.##pet$$824$0#

#&53$*If you accept this quest, Potter will immediately attack you.#|
10742|#&7$Halton##br#
"You...want to take on Potter? Well now, you've got my interest. Potter's the best bare-knuckle brawler in Lunarin."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"But I just can't shake it...what's Anthony up to with this match? Is he planning something?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"It's just a simple match-up. Don't worry too much about it. Just let Anthony know when you're ready."#npc$$821$1#|
10743|#&7$Potter##br#
"Hooooo-whee, Halton! You done saw that, right? Your challenger ain't half bad. My bones feel rattled like sticks in a storm."#br##br#
#&53$Potter rushes over to Halton.##M110010$Potter$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly apologize to Potter; hoping you didn't cause any lasting damage.##char$$809:75$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Potter? He'll be fine. We're talking about a man who boxes Birdbrains for a morning warmup."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Shucks, Halton, ya can't even wait for me to leave before you lay it on thick with the praise? I think I'm gonna blush."#M110010$Potter$823$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Well, %n%, you scored a decisive win. Not bad...not bad at all."#br##br#
#&53$Halton raises an eyebrow as he appraises you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"It was Anthony's idea for you to battle Potter. You must've given him a good impression, but he worried Potter wouldn't take up the fight. Looks like you both had a good time, though."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Well, Anthony was right on the money. If anyone can help this here town, %n% can. Halton will fill you in on the details."#M110010$Potter$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"The Village Chief wants to jaw at me again 'bout a few things, so I'll have to excuse myself. Pleased to make your acquaintance, %n% - hopefully we can slug it out again sometime, in front of a big ol' crowd!"#br##br#
#&53$Potter shakes your hand in a firm, country shake and ambles off into the distance.##M110010$Potter$822$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As Potter leaves, you ask Halton what kind of problem the village has that needs 'solving' by someone stronger than that.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"I'm sure Sue told you, but as things stand, we can't hold our Crescent Ceremony - not while the local fauna is on a rampage. We have no idea what's changed them so." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"My number-one headache, though, is those Gnomes who busted up our village a couple days ago. Adding injury to insult, they swiped the village's Ceremonial Vessel, a necessary piece in the ceremony."#npc$$828$1#|
10744|Anthony is curious to see if you can best Potter in battle. He wants you two to duke it out.

Defeat Potter after speaking with Anthony, then report back to Halton.|
10748|Get ready to battle Potter (Lv21. Strongman Competition).|
10750|Now is not the time to battle Potter. (Take on the "Strongman Competition" Quest.)|
10751|#&7$Halton##br#
"Crescent Hill is filled with energy, and the Ceremonial Vessel balances the energy from the forest. After the Ceremonial Vessel was stolen, the resulting imbalance of power affected the forest's creatures."#npc$$821$1##&PP00402#

#&7$Halton##br#
"The unbalanced, pent up energy can morph into physical beings. Not only are these balls of pure energy ferocious themselves, they also affect the nearby animals. The Flowertraps in the Crescent Flower Field are an example of the negative energy aggregations."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask how you can help resolve the situation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"I could definitely use your help. Getting rid of the Flowertraps requires some preparation. Please go near the Flower Field in the south and bring back the Glands from the Flower Beetles."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"We also need some Arcane Flowers. The pollen from Arcane Flowers enhances the fragrance of the Glands, but these precious blooms only grow in the area where Lunarin used to stand."#npc$$821$1#|
10752|#&7$Halton##br#
"The Glands from the Flower Beetles in Crescent Flower Field release a very unique odor. It'll be the sweet smell of success!"#npc$$821$1#|
10753|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the Glands and Arcane Flowers to Halton.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ostrich##br#
#&53$An ostrich comes forward, cocking its head, entranced by the sweet smell wafting from the glands and blooms. You quickly snatch the items out of the ostrich's reach.##M216010s75h-10$Ostrich$2$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"They don't smell too strongly now, but when I infuse the glands with the pollen and apply heat, the smell will intensify."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Now we can proceed to the next step."#br##br#
#&53$Halton cracks his knuckles eagerly.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"After the Glands of the Flower Beetles have been properly processed, we can use their distinct odor to draw out the most incredibly powerful King of the Flowertraps."#npc$$821$1#|
10754|Halton requests that you get the Glands from the Flower Beetles as well as Arcane Flowers. 

Go to Crescent Forest, and defeat the Flower Beetles to gather their Glands. Afterward, go to the old site of Lunarin and pick Arcane Flowers.|
10761|#&7$Halton##br#
"The King of the Flowertraps is very powerful. Even Potter can't defeat it. If you want to take it down, you'll need to strip it of its power first."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Unlike Flowertraps, Sprite Scale Dust has positive energy. If you can tame the Sprites and get them to help you, you can weaken the power of the King of Flowertraps."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"However, it's difficult for normal people to get close to the Sprites. If you try to approach them, they flit away. But I'm sure you've got a trick up your sleeve, right?"#br##br#
#&53$Halton says, a note of desperation in his voice.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You are looking at an Envoy of Gaia, who can control the Power of Gaia that flows through all living things, so the Sprites won't be able to detect %n%!"#br##br#
#&53$%p% pipes up cheerily.##pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Despite %p%'s vote of confidence, you insist that you will do your best, but can make no guarantees.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Very well, %n%. Take this sealed Bag and find the Sprites. First, create a distraction. Then, when the Sprites are at their weakest, catch one and bring it back."#npc$$821$1#|
10762|#&7$Halton##br#
"The Crescent Sprites and Flower Field Sprites are in Crescent Forest. Try to get close to them and use this bag to capture one."#npc$$821$1#|
10763|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the captured Sprite to Halton.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Excellent. Everything's going according to plan. We've finished our preparations, so now we just need to go to the Flower Field and defeat the King of the Flowertraps."#npc$$821$1#|
10764|Halton explains that to defeat the King of the Flowertraps, you have to use a Sprite to weaken its power. 

Go to the Crescent Forest and fight the Crescent Sprites and Flower Field Sprites until they are weak enough to be captured with the bag.|
10771|#&7$Halton##br#
"Though you captured a Sprite successfully, if we let it out, it will escape immediately."#br##br#
#&53$Without another word, Halton reaches over and plucks a single hair from your head.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You gasp in shock and demand to know what the big idea is.##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"I'm sorry, but legend has it that if you want a Sprite to calm down, you must let it get used to your scent."#br##br#
#&53$Halton shrugs apologetically, then puts your hair inside the bag with the captured Sprite.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You suppose that makes sense, though you suddenly have a wicked headache. You ask how to use the Sprite to defeat the King of the Flowertraps.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Take the Gland to the Flower Field. Meanwhile, the Sprite will get used to your scent. I'll send someone to meet you - and help you deal with the King of the Flowertraps."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"And, hey, since you're heading to the Flower Field, could you take out the Flowertraps along the way? Otherwise, when the time comes to face the King of the Flowertraps, you'll have to deal with those beastly blossoms, too."#npc$$821$1#|
10772|#&7$Jessie##br#
"Flowertraps have popped up all over the Flower Field. If we don't thin them out, things will get ugly when it comes time to deal with the King of the Flowertraps."#npc$$821$1#|
10773|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Glands and Bag containing the Sprite to Jessie, explaining that you have eliminated a good deal of Flowertraps on the way to the field.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jessie##br#
"Everyone in Lunarin is talking about you. I'm glad to finally meet you in the flesh; I was worried you were a figment of their hopeful imagination! %n%, I will help you deal with the King of the Flowertraps." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jessie##br#
"Only a few people here understand the severity of the situation. Even Potter is no match for the King of the Flowertraps..." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Jessie##br#
#&53$Jessie begins to open the bag containing the Sprite.##npc$$311$1#|
10774|Halton asks you to defeat the Flowertraps in the Flower Field so they won't bother you when you face off against the King of the Flowertraps. 

Go to the Flower Field and defeat the Giant Flowertraps and Evil Flowertraps.|
10781|#&7$Tamed Sprite##br#
#&53$The Sprite escapes as soon as Jessie opens the bag.##M018020$Tamed Sprite$52$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You fear it might take off, but when you stick out your hand, it moves over to you.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Jessie##br#
"Excellent! You've bonded with it; it isn't afraid of you at all!"#br#
#&53$Jessie can barely contain his enthusiasm.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Jessie##br#
"With the help of the Sprite, you can weaken the negative energy coming from the King of the Flowertraps. Ah, I almost forgot. We need to use the Glands to lure him out."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jessie##br#
"The King of the Flowertraps hates the smell of Flower Beetle Glands, but the Sprites love it!"#br##br#
#&53$Jessie pulls out a match from his backpack. He lights the Gland ablaze and blows out the match.##npc$$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You carefully take the Gland from Jessie and immediately smell a stench similar to old headcheese.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tamed Sprite##br#
#&53$The Tamed Sprite rocks back and forth happily. It seems to love the scent.##M018020$Tamed Sprite$2$1#

#&7$Jessie##br#
"The King of the Flowertraps hides deep inside the Flower Field. Even though you have the Sprite with you, you can't let your guard down. Use the Gland's smell to draw out the King of the Flowertraps, then slay the beast!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Jessie##br#
"Hopefully, we can bring good news to the Village Chief."#npc$$821$1#|
10782|#&7$Omar##br#
"You want to defeat the King of the Flowertraps? It is very powerful. You can't possibly handle him. Don't overexert yourself."#npc$$821$1#|
10783|#&7$Omar##br#
"Who asked an outsider to take on such a dangerous task? What would we do if the stranger got injured? Halton should have known better. And Anthony and Potter aren't thinking things through..."#br##br#
#&53$The Village Chief paces angrily.##npc$$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tap the Village Chief's shoulder. He turns, surprised to see you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"You, you're still in the village? Well, fine. Stay here. Don't go running off. This is not a tourist attraction. There are dangers everywhere!"#br##br#
#&53$Omar grunts.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Omar that you've already defeated the King of the Flowertraps. As you speak, you point the Sprite towards the Flower Field.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tamed Sprite##br#
#&53$The Sprite seems sad to leave. It moves off toward the Flower Field, but looks back over its shoulder at you, a melancholy expression on its face.##M018020$Tamed Sprite$101$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Well done, little Sprite."#br##br#
#&53$Omar watches the Sprite leave. He tries to remain stoic, but a contented grin flits across his weathered face.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Uh, yes, well, I'm very grateful for your help, but I do wish you'd use a less harsh method."#br##br#
#&53$His words seem insincere, but he can't wipe the smile from his face.##npc$$826$1#|
10784|Jessie releases the Sprite so it can help you defeat the King of the Flowertraps. 

Use the Sprite to defeat the King of the Flowertraps.|
10791|#&7$Omar##br#
"No matter what, you worked hard to protect our ceremony. If I didn't lend this key to you, the villagers would think me unreasonable."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"However, though the issue with the King of the Flowertraps has been solved, we still can't complete the ceremony. I'll give you the key - on one condition."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Help us retrieve our stolen Ceremonial Vessels so that we may complete the Crescent Ceremony, and I will lend you the key."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod firmly, agreeing to the deal.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I'm starting to like you more and more, stranger. Go to Anthony and bring back a container large enough to fit a person inside. It sounds odd, but it's all part of our genius plan."#npc$$821$1#|
10792|#&7$Omar##br#
"Anthony is in charge of many of the village's larger possessions. Go to him, and get a container big enough to hold a person, and we can proceed to the next step of the plan."#npc$$821$1#|
10793|#&7$Omar##br#
"Is that key really that important? It's been passed down in the village for generations, but no one knows exactly what it unlocks."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Large Urn to Omar.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I already sent Potter to observe the gnomes. You just need to go cause a commotion outside the Mistwalker Tribe and Halton can hide inside the Urn, then infiltrate the camp."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Don't worry about Halton. We just need you to create a distraction. He'll take advantage of the commotion and find the Ceremonial Vessels."#npc$$821$1#|
10794|Omar has already drawn up a new battle plan. He requests that you go to Anthony and obtain a Large Urn. When you bring back the urn, he'll fill you in on the details. 

Obtain a Large Urn from Anthony.|
10795|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain why you have come to Anthony.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"Ah, yes, the Village Chief already told me the details. I've a Large Urn here that is normally used to store water. It should work perfectly. Take the Urn to the Village Chief."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You pick up the Urn and get a good grip. %p% leans in toward you.##char$$1301$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"That Village Chief, Omar, seems to look to you as a part of the plan. If he needs help, why doesn't he just come out and ask?"#pet$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell %p% that the Village Chief is likely embarrassed. You implore %p% not to ask such questions in front of the Village Chief.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I understand. I guess it's a human thing."#pet$$821$1#|
10801|#&7$Omar##br#
"Now we'll proceed with the plan. You need to create a massive distraction."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Go to the north of the Mistwalker Tribe and cause a ruckus. Make sure the Tribal Patrolmen cannot control the chaos. Remember to put the Large Urn, the one Halton is hiding in, near the gate. Afterward, meet up with Potter."#npc$$821$1#|
10802|#&7$Potter##br#
"Those Gnomes are dumber than a sack of hammers. If you make a big scene north of the Mistwalker camp, they wouldn't notice the Urn even if it grew legs and walked up there itself."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Just set that there Urn near the gate. Those Gnomes love anything shiny, so they'll hoist it on back to their camp"#br##br#
#&53$Potter points at the Gnomes wandering around outside the camp.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Hell, even if he does get found out, Halton's a smart kid. I'm sure he can get the drop on a couple'a Gnomes."#npc$$821$1#|
10803|#&7$Potter##br#
"Ha! You see that? Lookit those Gnomes, runnin' around like chickens!"#br##br#
#&53$Potter doubles over with laughter.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Worked like a charm, it did! They never suspected the Urn. So, with Halton inside the camp, it looks like it's time for the next phase."#npc$$821$1#|
10804|Omar asks you to cause a commotion. Place the Large Urn containing Halton near the gate, and meet with Potter. 

Defeat the Tribal Patrolmen in the north of the camp, and place the Large Urn, with Halton crouched inside, near the gate.|
10811|#&7$Potter##br#
"What ya need to do now is buy Halton some time to search the camp. That means you've gotta raise a ruckus again - you seem good at that, anyhow."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"If their eyes are on you, they ain't gonna be on Halton. Just go in there swingin' and don't stop for a while. That oughtta give 'em a real show."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Now, for  maximum chaos, you'll wanna be smackin' down those Tribal Warriors and Tribal Elders. Hoooo boy, they'll be after you good!"#npc$$821$1#|
10812|#&7$Potter##br#
"The better you can tie up those Tribal Warriors and Tribal Elders, the more likely it is Halton'll find what he's lookin' for."#npc$$821$1#|
10813|#&7$Potter##br#
"You sure churned up a storm in there! Halton should have all the time he needs to swipe back those Ceremonial Vessels."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"I guess you're as amazing as they say you are. I can handle these Gnomes, but taking on so many at once would leave me gasping for breath."#npc$$821$1#|
10814|To provide cover for Halton's search, Potter asks you to distract the Gnomes inside the tribal camp. 

Defeat the Mistwalker Tribal Warriors and Tribal Elders.|
10821|#&7$Potter##br#
"It's Halton's show from this point out. You gave him the perfect setup, so now he's gotta take the reins. Here's hoping he can get those Ceremonial Vessels back."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Potter that you briefly saw a robot amongst the tribe.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"The Gnomes are probably using those contraptions to bolster their security. Let's just hope Halton can get through there without being detected by 'em."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$* After accepting this Quest, you will assume the identity of Halton and sneak into the Mistwalker Tribe to look for the Ceremonial Vessel.#|
10822|#&7$Potter##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
10823|#&7$Halton##br#
"Potter, I have returned!"#M003040$Halton$3001$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Well well, the intrepid infiltrator returns! Did ya find the Ceremonial Vessels? Need any medical treatment?"#br#
#&53$Potter asks, eager to hear about the mission.##M110010$Potter$822$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"You worry too much, Potter. I'm stronger than you think. Not a scratch on me, in fact!"#br##br#
#&53$Halton hands a few items he found to Potter.##M003040$Halton$828$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"I found the boxes that contain the Ceremonial Vessels, but some of them seem awfully light."#M003040$Halton$821$0#|
10824|It is up to Halton to find out where the Gnomes have hidden the Ceremonial Vessels. 

Find the Ceremonial Vessels concealed within the suspicious wooden box. 
|
10831|#&7$Potter##br#
"Hold on juuust a flower-pickin' minute - something's missing here!"#br##br#
#&53$Potter fishes around, but can't find the Ceremonial Stones.##M110010$Potter$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Well, while I was looking for the Ceremonial Vessels, I came upon a few robots. They seemed more powerful than I'd expect, given the Gnomes' mechanical abilities. I think perhaps the Ceremonial Stones are being used to strengthen those automatons." #M003040$Halton$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Halton, you go on back to the village with those Ceremonial Vessels. I'm seein' that a few pages of the Ceremonial Tome describing the worship ritual have been torn out, and we ain't leaving without that fistful of pages, or the stones."#M110010$Potter$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Understood. I'll leave these items here with you and %n%."#M003040$Halton$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"%n%, you can likely find the Ceremonial Stones within the Steamer Robots themselves. We have to get them back!"#br##br#
#&53$Halton smashes his fist into an open palm to punctuate his thought.##M003040$Halton$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"I was worried when the Gnomes still had the Ceremonial Vessels. If we attacked the Mistwalkers head on, we could've damaged the Vessels. But now..."#M110010$Potter$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"%n%, we need you to head into the camp and turn those Steamer Robots into scrap. Pry the Ceremonial Stones outta their wreckage, and bring 'em back!"#M110010$Potter$824$1#|
10832|#&7$Potter##br#
"If'n my guess is right, they've put our Ceremonial Stones inside their robots, so the path is clear: scrap those bots, and take back the stones."#npc$$821$1#|
10833|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You gingerly hand the Ceremonial Stones to Potter.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
#&53$Potter carefully examines the stones.##br##br#
"Doesn't look like they lost much'a their energy. Just a li'l mystical rechargin' and they should be good as new."#npc$$821$1#|
10834|Potter realizes that the Ceremonial Stones from some of the Ceremonial Vessels are missing. To prevent the Robots from exhausting the Stones' energy, he needs you to retrieve them. 

Extract the Ceremonial Stone Cores from the Steamer Robots. 

|
10841|#&7$Potter##br#
"%n%, while you were searchin' for the Ceremonial Stones, I saw the Gnomes' bossman, Rondel, comin' back to the camp." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"I'm thinkin' those missing pages from the Ceremonial Tome might have some magic like what the Gnomes used'ta use. I've got no doubt that if those pages are here, the Elder has 'em." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"I'm bettin' if you take down Elder Rondel, he'll have plenty of information we'd find quite enlightenin'. Then all you'd need to do is tell the Village Chief whatever Rondel spills to you." #npc$$821$1#|
10842|#&7$Omar##br#
"What did Potter have to report? Did he manage any clues about the torn pages from the Ceremonial Tome?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Halton told me that some idiot Gnomes have installed our Ceremonial Stones on their robots to provide power. Our stones, for their trashy machines! We have always lived in peace with the Gnomes here on Crescent Hill. Why did they all of a sudden decide to take the Ceremonial Stones? I don't understand it..." #npc$$821$1#|
10843|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You regretfully inform him that you found no traces of the Ceremonial Tome's missing pages, but you found a letter with half of its wax seal torn.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Wait, you what...? Let me look at that."#br##br#
#&53$Omar snatches the paper from your hands, squinting at the details of the envelope before opening it.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"This...this is a plan, I think! A list of instructions which the Gnomes must be following. Look, it starts with attacking the village and stealing Ceremonial Tome.'"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Who gave the Gnomes these instructions? Is someone controlling them? Maybe that's why they've taken our ritual items. It does make more sense..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"This situation has gotten a lot more serious. If we can use the broken seal to identify the writer, we can figure out who is calling the shots in this scheme."#npc$$821$1#|
10844|Potter thinks that Grand Mistwalker Elder Rondel has the missing pages, so he asks you to defeat him and search his body for clues on their whereabouts.|
10851|#&7$Omar##br#
"Talk about luck! There just happens to be a Scholar from Navea currently staying at the Clark Farm. She may be able to determine who sent this letter."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"As for the contents of the torn pages from the Ceremonial Tome, maybe she can decipher that as well." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"How about you go to the Clark Farm and look for the scholar. I believe her name is Rosie... I'll use this time to prepare that key."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, gathering the Ceremonial Tome and letter from Omar's hands. You turn to head out when Omar calls out to you.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Wait! I almost forgot: when Rosie was last in Lunarin, she asked Halton to post the Church's requests list, but I don't know if he managed to do it."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Before you see Rosie, check the village's Bulletin Board. If you see requests from any of the Church's scholars, let Rosie know. Want to keep up a good impression, after all."#npc$$821$1#|
10852|#&7$Rosie##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
10853|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Awkwardly, you clear your throat and tell Rosie that the requests from the Church have been posted on Lunarin's board with other adventurers already answering the call.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Oh thank you, I'm glad that our requests have received some response."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Feeling a little encouraged, you quickly introduce yourself, then delve into the details of Omar's request. As you do, you hand her the Ceremonial Tome and the letter.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Oh, I see now. You're the one who defeated the King of the Flowertraps and retrieved the Ceremonial Tome." #$$821$1##br#
#&53$Rosie carefully spreads out the items before her as she talks.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"I didn't expect someone with such a reputation to be so young."#br##br#
#&53$Rosie studies you and %p% with a stoic, analytical gaze.##npc$$823$1#|
10854|Omar thinks you should ask Rosie, the Scholar from Navea, about the missing pages of the Ceremonial Tome and the envelope's seal. But before this, you must first visit Mirabelle's Bulletin Board in Lunarin to check if Rosie's announcement has been posted. 

After checking Mirabelle's Bulletin Board in Lunarin, take the missing pages of the Ceremonial Tome and the Mysterious Letter to Rosie at Clark Farm.
|
10855|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You glance through Mirabelle's Bulletin Board for any requests from the Church's scholars.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After careful scrutinization, you determine that no such announcements have been posted. Perhaps Halton forgot to put them up?##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"%n%, I thought you left already. Aren't you supposed to deliver those clues to the Clark Farm?"#br##br#
#&53$Halton approaches you, frowning slightly with his eyebrows raised in surprise.##M003040$Halton$3001$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Heh, speaking of duties, you ask Halton about the Church's requests.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Oh, that's what this is all about. Don't waste your time on it. I posted Rosie's request a while ago. It hadn't been up for more than a couple of days before some traveler tore it off the board. So, not only did I post the request, but someone's already taking care of it."#M003040$Halton$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod. Looking at the board has gotten you curious about it. You decide to ask Halton about it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Every town and city, even Navea, has one of these Bulletin Boards somewhere. Typically, someone will post an ad requesting something to be done. Adventurers like to answer these ads as a way to make extra cash." #M003040$Halton$821$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Did you see anything interesting on there, %n%? You can always return to this board later to take a closer look. I'm sure there's lots of work here for someone of your skill."#M003040$Halton$821$1#|
10861|#&7$Rosie##br#
"It shouldn't take me long to study this Tome before I can tell you what's missing. Identifying this wax seal, on the other hand, will be much more of a tedious task."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"The Seal has been worn down almost smooth. From what I can gather so far, I can think of at least five tribes that may use markings like these on their seals. I'll need time to reduce this number." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Hmm... I want to try to recreate this seal. To do that, though, I'll need some Soft Shell Powder."#br##br#
#&53$Rosie runs her fingers over the broken wax seal, brow furrowed in deep thought.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Hey Clark? Is it possible to get some soft beetle shells? Or some powder?"#br##br#
#&53$Rosie suddenly lifts her voice, raising her head to look for the owner of the farm.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"Shells, you say? Oh, we don't have those here... but you can catch some Heliotrope Beetles southwest of here. They don't have any natural predators, so their shells are quite soft..."#M005020$Clark$821$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"That'll work. Now, I just need to obtain them."#br##br#
#&53$Rosie turns to pin you with an expectant look.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You look at %p%, then back at Rosie, throwing your shoulders back and nodding your head stiffly. You are ready for the job.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Ah, good. In case you didn't hear, go southwest of Clark Farm in search of Heliotrope Beetles and obtain their shells. If possible, I'd also like for you to grind them up into a fine powder before giving them to me."#npc$$821$1#|
10862|#&7$Rosie##br#
"You'll find Heliotrope Shells, on, as you might guess, Heliotrope Beetles. They skitter about southwest of Clark Farm. Remember to grind them into powder after you get them."#npc$$821$1#|
10863|#&7$Rosie##br#
"While conducting archaeological research, you often run into this situation. I've seen it time and time again."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Powder to Rosie.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Heliotrope Powder isn't ideal in this situation, but with the state of this seal, it should be more than enough."#npc$$821$1#|
10864|Rosie wants to recreate the totem on the Wax Seal, so she asks you to obtain some materials. 

Go to the southwest of Clark Farm, obtain the Soft Shells from the Heliotrope Beetles, and grind them into a fine powder.|
10871|#&7$Rosie##br#
"Next, I'll need some pure water to mix with the powder. If there are any impurities in the water, it'll come back to bite us when we're recreating the seal."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Go to the southwest of Clark Farm and get a bucket of water from the shoal there. The water there will work best for our purposes."#npc$$821$1#|
10872|#&7$Rosie##br#
"The shoal southwest of Clark Farm has the cleanest water for miles. Remember not to let any impurities enter the water."#npc$$821$1#|
10873|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the bucket full of water to Rosie.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Now we just need to mix it up, put the Wax Seal inside, and wait for it to get clean,"#br##br#
#&53$Rosie instructs primly, narrating each step of the process.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"%n%, what brings you to the village? We don't get a lot of outsiders here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain that you've come to Lunarin because you want to borrow the key to the Starlight Treasure Chest from Village Chief Omar.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"The key to the Starlight Treasure Chest?"#br##br#
#&53$Rosie lowers her head. You can practically see the gears turning in her head as she continues her task.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Recreating the seal requires some time. Why don't you come back in a bit?"#npc$$821$1#|
10874|Rosie needs pure water to mix with the powder, so she asks you to fetch some.

Go to the shoal southwest of Clark Farm and draw some pure water.|
10881|#&7$Clark##br#
"I'm sorry to bother you while you're so busy, but I desperately need some help."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"We rarely get guests, especially such important ones. I'd like to make a good impression on them, but with all these annoying Beetles flitting about, I fear their research will be interrupted."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"Could you get rid of the Grassy Beetles in the southwest of Clark Farm? If you see any Beetle Eggs, squash 'em. The filthy insects multiply at an alarming rate."#npc$$821$1#|
10882|#&7$Clark##br#
"There are Grassy Beetles and Beetle Eggs southwest of Clark Farm. Please exterminate the bugs and dispose of their eggs."#npc$$821$1#|
10883|#&7$Clark##br#
"Rosie and her researchers are investigating the Alabastren Temple Ruins. The place has been abandoned for centuries, but in ancient times, Lunarin ceremonies were held there."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"However, the Church suddenly decided to close down the Alabastren Temple, so it's been vacant ever since. People rarely go near it anymore."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain that you eliminated a good deal of Grassy Beetles, but they seem to bounce back quite quickly.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Clark##br#
"I'm ashamed to say that I've been so busy talking to Rosie and her people that I've neglected the farm work. I need to make up for that now."#br##br#
#&53$Clark sighs, his cheeks flushed.##npc$$821$1#|
10884|Clark fears that the Beetles near the farm will interrupt the scholars' research, so he asks you to help get rid of them.

"I've actually already made up some pesticide. I just haven't had a chance to get out there and spray. The farm has suffered because of it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"%n%, please go around the farm and spray this Pesticide. It should keep the pests at bay for a while."#npc$$821$1#|
10892|#&7$Clark##br#
"Just spray the Pesticide around the farm and those pests won't dare come near."#npc$$821$1#|
10893|#&7$Clark##br#
"Thank you very much. What's in the Pesticide, you ask? Don't worry about it. We only use natural ingredients that won't hurt the environment."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"This particular Pesticide can stop a certain type of bug from getting close. I can't let those insects destroy the farm I've worked so hard to build."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clark##br#
"Now the scholars can focus on their research, and I'll make a good impression on the Church."#npc$$821$1#|

"This Stolen Ceremonial Tome was originally the Church's book of spells. Blessings are written within it, but there are more than a few curses hidden inside, too."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Whoever tore out the pages was probably looking for the curses. I need to know what kind of curses are inside the book."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"Breaking the curse's seal requires some more materials, so I'll need your help to get them. Please go to Altar of the Moon and gather the Scale Dust from the wings of the Sprites."#npc$$821$1#|
10902|#&7$Rosie##br#
"If you get the Scale Dust from the wings of the Sprites near the Altar of the Moon, I can use it to read the curses written in the tome."#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$You hand the Scale Dust to Rosie.##char$$821$0#

10911|#&7$Rosie##br#
"While I decode these lost curses, you should make a trip to Navea."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"After you report your actions to the Church, there is a Templar who wants to meet you. Her name is Anya, and she dwells in the outskirts of Navea."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You naturally feel a bit hesitant. You've come to the Crescent Forest to borrow the key to open the Starlight Treasure Chest. Why do tasks keep getting in the way of your goal?##char$$828$0#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"I still need some time to decipher the curses in the tome. I'll keep working on that. If I come up with anything, I'll tell Omar immediately."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"I might be done by the time you get back."#br##br#
#&53$She smiles hopefully.##npc$$821$1#|
10912|#&7$Anya##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
10913|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A confident female templar stands before you, her bright red hair whipping in the wind. She must be the one Rosie mentioned: Templar Anya.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Are you %n%? I see. You're younger than I expected."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Anya gives you a once over, raising an eyebrow. You notice that, for just a moment, she seems surprised by %p%. She quickly hides her shock under Templar stoicism.##char$$821$0#|
10914|Rosie needs some time to decipher the curses, so she asks you to make a trip to Navea to discuss something with a Templar. 

Go to Navea in the northwest and look for Templar Anya.|
10921|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You politely prepare to introduce yourself to Anya, hoping to dissolve her judging gaze.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
#&53$Anya, however, interrupts you as soon as you open your mouth.##br##br#
"Forget the pleasantries. I know who you are. Go get some Forest Flowertrap Tendrils for me."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Stunned, you aren't sure how to respond to this demand.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The Forest Flowertraps grow outside Navea. Just pull the Tendrils off of them. Don't ask why. Just do it. We'll talk more when you finish."#npc$$821$1#|
10922|#&7$Anya##br#
"The Forest Flowertraps blossom outside Navea. Go snatch their Tendrils, then we'll talk."#br##br#
#&53$Anya turns away curtly.##npc$$821$1#|
10923|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You pass the Forest Flowertrap Tendrils to Anya.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I see."#br##br#
#&53$She examines them carefully.##npc$$821$1#|
10924|Anya wants you obtain the Tendrils from the Forest Flowertraps. 

Go outside Navea and obtain the Tendrils from the Forest Flowertraps.|
10931|#&7$Anya##br#
"Now I need you to get me the Splendid Essence of the Navea Birdbrain."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are stumped and more than a little annoyed; you have no idea what Anya is up to.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The Spring Water around Navea possesses a special energy. This energy is condensed within the bodies of the Birdbrains found outside Navea,"#br#
#&53$Anya snaps, pacing.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The Condensed Essence of the river water should be inside the bodies of the Birdbrains. Combine a few Condensed Essences to make the Splendid Essence, then give it to me."#npc$$821$1#|
10932|#&7$Anya##br#
"The Navea Birdbrains and Waterborne Birdbrains roost outside Navea. After you get the Condensed Essences, remember to combine them to form Splendid Essence."#npc$$821$1#|
10933|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Anya snatches the Splendid Essence from you. You ask her why she needs the Tendrils.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"You'll see soon enough,"#br##br#
#&53$Anya says dismissively.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
#&53$She pulls out the Flowertrap Tendrils and slashes a hole in one with a sharp knife. A light green liquid immediately oozes from the tendril.##npc$$51$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
#&53$Anya murmurs an incantation you've never heard before; a faint halo of light emanates from the hole in the tendril. You remain suspicious of Anya's motives. Suddenly, the light converges on %p%.##npc$$311$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$The light quickly envelopes %p%. %p% closes its eyes and begins to hover in midair.##pet$$502$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your heart begins to race. You scream at Anya to stop as you watch %p% float higher and higher.##char$$823:79$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Don't worry. I just need to get a handle on how much you can control the Eidolon. It won't hurt... much,"#br##br#
#&53$Anya drones with a twisted smile.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$After a moment, %p% floats down to earth. It begins to squirm slightly, stretching.##br##br#
"Don't worry. I'm okay."#pet$$1001$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$%p% seems unaffected, but Anya's actions infuriate you. Furthermore, her mention of "Eidolon" scares you a bit.##char$$827:0$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I'm sorry. I suppose I've been quite rude. When we meet people who can control an Eidolon, we must immediately know which side they've chosen."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"If they've already succumbed to evil, well..."#br##br#
#&53$Anya trails off.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You suddenly remember Brian and the Bloodthirsty Panther in the Harbor. Brian was incredibly dangerous and unpredictable, so you suppose you can understand Anya's perspective.##char$$828:75$0#|
10934|Anya wants you to obtain the Essences inside the Birdbrains and combine them into a Splendid Essence to give to her. 

Go outside Navea and obtain the Condensed Essences from the Navea Birdbrains and Waterborne Birdbrains, then combine them to create Splendid Essence.|
10941|#&7$Anya##br#
"I just used the Flowertrap Tendrils as a means to conduct a simple test. I can confirm that you won't pose any threat to people at the moment."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are eager to get rid of the Eidolon, not wanting to be anything like Brian. However, when Anya says you are safe, you feel somewhat relieved.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Ever since Rosie found out that you defeated the King of Flowertraps, she started to suspect that you were an Envoy of Gaia. Which would explain the Eidolon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"You're so young, and you haven't gone through any rigorous training yet. That you came here for the key to the Starlight Treasure Chest; and why you want it, says that you haven't given in to the temptation of power. Yet."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The Splendid Essence that you just collected was used to test the purity of the Eidolon. The color of the essence changes, depending on the spiritual state of the one who collected it. That's how the Grand Bishop judges you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Grand Bishop? You arch an eyebrow. Anya notices your surprise.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"What I mean, %n%, is that the Grand Bishop wants to see you. I'll just bet you have some questions for him, too."#npc$$821$1#|
10942|#&7$Grand Bishop##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
10943|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You gingerly hand the Splendid Essence to the Grand Bishop.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"You've come at last."#br##br#
#&53$The Grand Bishop examines the Splendid Essence. His tranquil smile eases your anxiety.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
#&53$The Grand Bishop peers at the Essence, then glances at %p%. He begins to recite a strange spell, and the Essence glows more and more brightly with each word.##npc$$311$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% watches silently.##pet$$1$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"This essence tells me that your Eidolon is very powerful indeed. I can't tell if it will be a danger in the future, but it will continue to change."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After hearing this, you tell the Grand Bishop what had happened to Brian in Skandia. A Bloodthirsty Panther had swallowed him, turning him into a savage beast.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I regret to hear that. He couldn't resist the desire for power, and the Eidolon devoured him."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Grand Bishop##br#
"Those who have power awakened in them by the Cube of Gaia can manipulate the imperceptible powers that pulse through this world, and control them as well."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You haven't heard about the Cube of Gaia for a while. You've always thought it existed only in myths and legends. You never dreamed it could be real.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Grand Bishop##br#
"%n%, you are the Envoy of Gaia who can control Gaia's power, a legend summoned by the Cube of Gaia." #npc$$821$1#|
10944|Anya explains that the Essence can determine the state of your inner spirit. She asks you to take the Essence to the Grand Bishop.

Take the Splendid Essence to Navea and request an audience with the Grand Bishop.|
10951|#&7$Anya##br#
"Not long after you left, there was a commotion in the east right where we set up the Boulder Keepers."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The Church once placed these keepers around the Alabastren Temple. They were meant to keep people from entering. However, those guards have become restless. I fear something big must've happened inside the temple."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Please go to the east and make the rounds at Alabastren Temple to find out what happened. If my suspicions are correct, you may also need to make a trip to the Altar of the Moon."#npc$$825$1#|
10952|#&7$Anya##br#
"Head east of here and you'll see the ruins of the Alabastren Temple."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The Church sealed the temple long ago. If someone wanted to break that seal, it and the Altar of the Moon in the south would suffer."#npc$$821$1#|
10953|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report the results of your patrol to Anya. Gnomes completely surround the Alabastren Temple Ruins and the Altar of the Moon is disturbingly abandoned.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I never would have guessed that the Gnomes would activate the defense mechanism."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"As you observed, the Altar of the Moon is empty. The Crescent Gem that was originally offered at the altar is crucial if we want to break the seal on the Alabastren Temple."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Apparently, the Mistwalker Tribe plans to invade the Alabastren Temple. We have to report this to the Church."#npc$$827$1#|
10954|An inexplicable commotion has erupted at Alabastren Temple. Anya asks you to investigate the situation. 

Go to the east of Navea and patrol the outside of the Alabastren Temple and the Altar of the Moon.|

"%n%, get rid of those guards. They've begun to rebel, and they are no longer of use to the Church. I'll notify the Church about this."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You voice your fear that the Gnomes might invade the Ruins.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I'm not too worried about that. If you just have the Crescent Gem, but not the spell that breaks the seal, you can't remove the temple's seal. You need both components."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"First, get rid of the Alabastren Temple Guards, then report the situation to the Lunarin Village Chief. Also, ensure that the villagers stay away from the Alabastren Temple Ruins."#npc$$821$1#|
10962|#&7$Omar##br#
"I heard there was a commotion in the east of the city. I wonder what happened to the Guards at the Alabastren Temple Ruins. If they get out of control, we've no choice but to destroy them."#npc$$821$1#|
10963|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the Village Chief about the runaway Guards.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"What? How could this happen? The Crescent Gem has been stolen, too."#br##br#
#&53$Omar wrings his hands in worry. You notice Rosie standing alongside him.##M007020$Omar$828$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"This is bad news, %n%. You might not know this, but the text written on the torn out pages of the Stolen Ceremonial Tome contained a spell capable of opening the temple."#M115020$Rosie$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"I've recreated the wax seal. It is the totem of the Ventos Prairie Makar Tribe."#M115020$Rosie$821$1#

#&7$Rosie##br#
"That means that the Makar might have commanded the Gnomes to steal the Ceremonial Tome, the Ceremonial Vessel, and even the Crescent Gem. They desperately want to get into the Alabastren Temple."#M115020$Rosie$821$1#|
10964|To prevent innocent passersby from getting hurt, Anya asks you to get rid of the rebellious Guards, then report to the Village Chief.

"This just keeps getting worse. The Key to the Starlight Treasure Chest is in the Altar of the Moon. We can't get the Key without the Crescent Gem,"#br#
#&53$Omar stammers, a sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Even though the wax seal comes from the Makar, we can't take any chances. They've never made trouble here before."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"According to Makar tradition, if you surrender to an enemy, you must wear his Braided Rope."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"If the Gnomes are really working for the Makar, they should have Makar Colored Braided Ropes tied somewhere on their bodies. Go to the Temple Ruins, get a good look at the Mistwalker Bandits, and check if they have the ropes."#npc$$821$1#|
10972|#&7$Omar##br#
"Please go to the Alabastren Temple Ruins and search for the Mistwalker Bandits. See if they have Colored Braided Ropes anywhere on their bodies."#npc$$821$1#|
10973|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You show Omar the Braided Ropes.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I guess the Makar really are in charge. Rosie is very knowledgeable, so I'm sure she's right about the totem. The Makar involvement makes everything much more complicated."#npc$$821$1#|
10974|To see if the Makar have control over the bandits, Omar asks you to check the Bandits outside the Ruins.

10981|#&7$Anthony##br#
"I've sent my assistant, who specializes in machinery, to investigate the current situation at the Alabastren Temple. After all, the Gnomes are also very adept at mechanics. They've likely set traps to keep us away."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain that Anya has already reported back to the Church. You suggest that you should wait for the Church's army.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"It'll take too long for the army to assemble. And besides, aren't you in a hurry to get the Key due to your little spirit problem? The Village Chief's probably worried sick about you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anthony##br#
"My assistant is smart, but he can't fight his way out of a paper bag. While he investigates, please take out the Mistwalker Bandits at the Alabastren Temple Ruins."#npc$$821$1#|
10982|#&7$Anthony##br#
"Please get rid of the Mistwalker Bandits outside the Alabastren Temple Ruins. That way, my assistant can investigate without any distractions."#npc$$821$1#|
10983|#&7$Anthony##br#
"Thank you very much. Our village is normally a tranquil, safe place. I wonder why so many terrible things are happening at the same time?"#npc$$821$1#|

"These Gnomes are clever, skilled, and adept at battle. If you don't get rid of them first, it will be very difficult to take any other actions."#npc$$1$1#

"You ought to concentrate on dealing with the Invaders first. When you finish with that, meet up with Paolo, my assistant."#npc$$821$1#|
10992|#&7$Paolo##br#
"Now's not the time for introductions. I need you to take care of those Mistwalker Invaders first. I'd do it but, well... you're a fighter, I'm a thinker."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#|

"Though we Dwarves are short, we are excellent at building machines, and we're quite swift. This investigation is easy for someone like me."#M050011$Paolo$825$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"However, if we encounter any resistance, we're in trouble. One bash in the head, and we're toast. That's why we've asked you to take care of the fighting. I saw you handle the Mistwalker Invaders like a champ. I think we'll make a good team. You've got the brawn, and I've got the brains. And looks."#M050011$Paolo$828$1#

11014|Paolo needs to know the source of the Robots' energy to figure out the next part of his plan. 

Use the Detector at the Alabastren Temple Ruins to obtain an Energy Index.|
11021|#&7$Paolo##br#
"You must stop these Robots. If you don't, the powerful energy flowing into their cores will cause them to become sentient... and likely go rogue."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"When dealing with Mainframe Soldiers, it's best to use electricity to paralyze them. It'll render them unable to move for a short period of time."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"You've got to take care of the Engineers, as well. If they're not out of the picture, they'll repair the paralyzed Robots as fast as you can take them out!"#M050011$Paolo$821$1#|
11022|#&7$Paolo##br#
"Quick, use electricity to stun the Mainframe Soldiers. Don't forget to defeat those annoying Mistwalker Engineers while you're at it."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#|
11023|#&7$Paolo##br#
"Ah, you're back! How many of those things did you take out?" #M050011s85h+70$Paolo$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report to Paolo that you've paralyzed the Mainframe Soldiers and defeated all the Engineers.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"Well done. However, the energy here feels very unstable. It may be some distance from the town, but if it keeps spreading, there's no telling what it might do."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"We Dwarves are very accustomed to seeing magic mix with machinery, but I've been away from home for a long time. This is the first time I've seen such powerful energy. It reminds me of the situation in my home village."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"During this season, my village holds the revered Robot Competition. In past years, it's always been a big celebration, like the ceremony in Lunarin."#br##br#
#&53$Paolo smiles wistfully.##M050011$Paolo$825$1#|
11024|To stop the Gnomes and Robots from getting in your way, Paolo insists that you paralyze the Robots and defeat the Engineers. 

Defeat the Mistwalker Engineers around the Alabastren Temple Ruins and use electricity to paralyze the Mainframe Soldiers.|
11031|#&7$Paolo##br#
"Since we want to destroy those Robots anyway, we may as well harvest some of their parts. The more spare parts we have, the better."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"%n%, sorry to trouble you, but while you're slicing and dicing Mainframe Soldiers, can you grab some Mechanical Parts for me? It would be such a waste to just leave 'em behind."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You know very little about those hunks of metal, so you ask Paolo if he'd like to follow behind you and collect spare parts while you battle Mainframe Soldiers.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"You really get me, %n%. Normally, I'd be more than willing to pick up the parts myself, but right now, I've something very important to attend to."#M050011$Paolo$823$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"While you unleash the beast on those scrap heaps, I need to investigate the depths of the Alabastren Temple. Maybe I can dig up some clues."#br##br#
#&53$Paolo cracks his knuckles.##M050011$Paolo$828$1#|
11032|#&7$Paolo##br#
"Quick, destroy the Mainframe Soldiers. And don't forget to bring back some of their parts."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#|
11033|#&7$Paolo##br#
#&53$Even from afar, you can tell that his gaze is trained on what you have in your hand.##M050011s85h+70$Paolo$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Parts to Paolo.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"With new research comes the need for new parts. Next time I develop something, I won't have to spend so much money buying gadgets."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"Of course, I didn't ask you to destroy those Soldiers just so I could save some coin. This is all about stopping the Gnomes,"#br##br#
#&53$Paolo explains quickly when he sees your annoyed reaction.##M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% seems very interested after seeing Paolo's panic.##pet$$1$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"Hey, hey, don't look at me like that. Everybody likes to save money, right?"#M050011$Paolo$828$1#|
11034|The decision had been made to destroy the Soldiers. While you are at it, Paolo asks you to collect some of their parts. 

Gather some Mechanical Parts from the Mainframe Soldiers at the Alabastren Temple Ruins.|
11041|#&7$Paolo##br#
"I actually just got back myself. This investigation yielded some excellent results."#br##br#
#&53$Paolo grins proudly.##M050011s85h+70$Paolo$825$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"I discovered a group of Makar deep within the Ruins. They're awfully conceited; they wouldn't deign to interact with the Gnomes normally. I eavesdropped on their conversation..."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"I heard the Makar lying to the Gnomes. They told them that ancient mechanical technology lies inside the Alabastren Temple!"#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"We're getting closer to the truth. %n%, you must take out the Mysterious Provocateurs. Without anyone to lead them, the Gnomes will disperse quickly."#M050011$Paolo$824$1#|
11042|#&7$Paolo##br#
"You must quickly defeat the group of Mysterious Provocateurs. They'll only make trouble for the Alabastren Temple Ruins."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#|
11043|#&7$Paolo##br#
"Did you find the Makar I was talking about?" #M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report your epic defeat of the Mysterious Provocateurs to Paolo.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"Those foolish Gnomes. They focus all their energy on one thing. Didn't anyone ever tell them not to put all of their eggs in one basket?"#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"They don't understand machines, yet they attempt to build them anyway, blindly ambling toward impossible goals. Those morons will never have the skill that we Dwarves naturally possess."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"I believe the Makar movements were carefully organized. They're surely planning something. Oddly enough, though, none of the ones at the Ruins appear to be leaders."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#|
11044|After finally discovering traces of the Makar, Paolo requests that you defeat them. 

Defeat the Mysterious Provocateurs at the Alabastren Temple Ruins.|
11051|#&7$Paolo##br#
"I've determined the location of the Page of the Ceremonial Tome. The Mistwalker Chief has them."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"%n%, you must take on the Mistwalker Chief and retrieve the Page of the Ceremonial Tome." #M050011$Paolo$827$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"Bring that fool back here. We need to ask the Gnome Chief about the Makar Leader's location."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#|
11052|#&7$Paolo##br#
"You must quickly defeat the Mistwalker Chief and retrieve the Page of the Ceremonial Tome. Don't forget to bring the Chief back with you! We have more than a few things to ask him."#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$821$1#|
11053|#&7$Paolo##br#
#&53$All traces of mirth and anxiety fall from Paolo's demeanor as he watches you and the Chief approach.##M050010s85h+70$Paolo$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Pages over to Paolo and push the Chief forward.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mistwalker Chief##br#
"Not so rough, kid! I thought you humans respected your elders!"#br##br#
#&53$The Chief grunts angrily.##M044040s85h+70$Mistwalker Chief$828$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"There's much more than just a little shove in store for you if you don't tell us how to find the Makar Chief."#M050010$Paolo$828$1#

#&7$Mistwalker Chief##br#
"Makar? Didn't you drive off the Makar?"#br##br#
#&53$The Mistwalker Chief picks at his ears, smirking. He doesn't seem to know that disaster is looming.##M044040$Mistwalker Chief$821$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
#&53$Paolo narrows his eyes into threatening slits, then cracks his knuckles.##M050010$Paolo$827$1#

#&7$Mistwalker Chief##br#
#&53$Only then does fear cross the Chief's eyes.##br##br#
"Hold on... just... just tell me what you want!"#M044040$Mistwalker Chief$823$0#

#&7$Mistwalker Chief##br#
"You, you're talking about Master Odum? He... he already broke the temple's seal and took the Adjutant inside..."#br##br#
#&53$The Mistwalker Chief lowers his head and averts his gaze.##M044040$Mistwalker Chief$501$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"What are you talking about?!"#br##br#
#&53$Paolo explodes, his entire body tense with rage.##M050010$Paolo$823$1#|
11054|To recover the Pages and determine the location of the Makar Leader, Paolo asks you to take down the Chief. 

Defeat the Mistwalker Chief and retrieve the Pages of the Ceremonial Tome. Bring them and the Chief back with you.|
11061|#&7$Paolo##br#
"This is a major setback. We've got to wait for the Church's army. This is no trivial matter!"#M050011s85h+70$Paolo$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You try to calm Paolo down, expressing that perhaps you should first try to capture the Makar known as Odum.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"The Church sealed this temple long ago. They must've had their reasons. Something terrible likely dwells inside."#M050011$Paolo$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"I have a really bad feeling about this. Get to the Alabastren Temple and draw out the mastermind, Odum, and his Adjutant!"#M050011$Paolo$821$1#|
11062|#&7$Odum##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
11063|#&7$Odum##br#
"I've lost."#br##br#
#&53$The young Makar releases a torrential sigh and places his head in his hands.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Odum##br#
"I come from Ventos Prairie. They call me Odum, the Third Prince of the Ventos Tribe. May I have the honor of knowing the name of the one who vanquished me?"#br##br#
#&53$Odum salutes you.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You introduce yourself to him. Odum doesn't appear to be such a villainous invader; he seems more like a simply dressed nobleman. You ask Odum why he wants to get into the Alabastren Temple.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Odum##br#
#&53$Odum sighs deeply.##br##br#
"The ancient texts describe a powerful energy sealed within the temple. I thought I could use the energy to defeat my brothers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Odum##br#
"It was a poor plan, to be sure. When even a young human like yourself can wield such amazing power, how could I expect an outside force to compete with natural talent and pure strength? I never stood a chance against my brothers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell him you represent Lunarin, asking him to leave the Alabastren Temple alone.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Odum##br#
"You mean... you'll let me go?"#br##br#
#&53$Odum gasps, then falls silent.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Odum##br#
"So, this is true power, Master %n%. I willingly surrender to you, and I shall wear your Braided Rope. I will no longer rely on outside forces to fortify my power. I must look inside myself instead."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Surprised by his reaction, you aren't sure what to say.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Odum##br#
"After we Makar achieve victory, the loser wears the victor's Braided Rope. It is a sign of surrender. You will allow me to leave, but I can't go yet..."#br##br#
#&53$Odum bites his lip.##npc$$821$1#|
11064|After you confirm that the Alabastren Temple's seal has been compromised, Paolo asks you to enter the Temple and defeat the Makar, Odum. 
Go to the Alabastren Temple (Solo) and defeat Odum.|
11071|#&7$Odum##br#
"It was only after I entered Alabastren Temple that I learned that the power there had seduced others as well. In fact, the Church sealed the temple to prevent the energy from corrupting the innocent."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Odum##br#
"I was able to decipher the text here. Long ago, a human entered the temple, seeking that power. However, once he obtained it, his body could not bear the burden..." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Odum's story seems oddly familiar. Suddenly, %p% interrupts to express doubt.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, you're right. An Envoy of Gaia was the one who invaded the temple,"#br##br#
#&53$%p% explains tensely.##pet$$824$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"He grew hungry for more and more power, and in the end, it consumed him. It transformed him into a monster!"#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Even though the Grand Bishop and Anya assured you that you aren't in danger, you fear that if you don't get rid of the Eidolon soon, it will devour your soul.##char$$826:0$0#

#&7$Odum##br#
"This is all my fault. I broke the Church's seal, releasing that abomination. Because of my carelessness, the Crescent Forest will suffer. I never intended for this to happen."#br##br#
#&53$Thick tears pour forth from his eyes.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod to Odum, assuring him that before the Church army arrives, you'll help him prevent the corrupted Envoy from leaving the Alabestren Temple.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Odum##br#
"Really? That's great. With %n% here..."#br##br#
#&53$Recalling something, he searches his pockets, fishing out and handing you a gem.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Odum##br#
"I'm very sorry for everything that I have done. After we secure the temple, please return the Crescent Gem to Lunarin for me."#npc$$828$1#|
11072|#&7$Omar##br#
"I hear the Temple's seal has been broken. Rosie also told me that a Zombie was locked within the temple. Under no circumstances can we allow that Zombie to wreak destruction on us - or eat our brains."#npc$$828$1#|
11073|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand over the Crescent Gem and explain to Omar what had happened in the temple.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"You defeated the corrupted power in the temple, and made it back safely? You are truly a legend!"#br##br#
#&53$Omar exclaims with uncharacteristic glee.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"We need to celebrate! You may not be from this village, but as long as you remain respectful to our Ancestors, you will surely receive their blessing!"#npc$$829$1#|
11074|After learning that a cursed Envoy is within the Temple, Odum begs you to defeat it. 

Defeat the Cursed Sonjuno in the Alabastren Temple Hall, then give the Crescent Gem to Omar in Lunarin.|
11081|#&7$Omar##br#
"%n%, I don't know how to thank you. With all that you've done...I guess...oh, well shoot."#br##br#
#&53$Omar seems quite apprehensive.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Hey, Grandpa, welcome back."#br##br#
#&53$Halton smiles, moving over to pat Omar's shoulder.##M003040$Halton$825$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"I'm sorry %n%. This is how my grandpa is. He lets his pride get the best of him, but he really does appreciate what you've done around here."#M003040$Halton$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Pride! You pretentious little fool!" #br##br#
#&53$Omar fumes at Halton, clearly insulted.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I was just... Going to ask %n% to host the most important ceremony in Lunarin."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$How flattering for Omar to offer you such a position in the ceremony! Too bad you know nothing about it, so you'll undoubtedly mess up this important Lunarin tradition.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Oh, what are you afraid of, just accept! It's not often Grandpa is this generous. He's never let an outsider host the Ceremony before, so this is truly something special. All you have to do is take the Crescent Gem to the Altar of the Moon. With a sincere heart, the gem's power will be released."#M003040$Halton$825$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"That's it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sue##br#
"Halton! We should go. We still need to take the Ceremonial Vessel and flowers to the Altar of the Moon."#br##br#
#&53$Sue gestures to a cart of flowers nearby.##M106010$Sue$828$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Oh, right... Grandpa, %n%, I'm going ahead to the Altar of the Moon. We'll meet up there."#M003040$Halton$822$0#

#&7$Sue##br#
"%n%, hurry! Everyone will be waiting for you!"#br##br#
#&53$Sue flashes you an anxious smile as she takes Halton by the arm, pulling him away.##M106010$Sue$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Don't sweat it, it should be simple enough. After the ceremony ends, I'll get you the key to open the Starlight Treasure Chest."#clean$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Sheepishly, without making eye contact, Omar hands the Crescent Gem over to you.##char$$821$0#|
11082|#&7$Omar##br#
"Hurry to the Altar of the Moon and use the Crescent Gem. Every villager has been waiting a long time for this." #npc$$821$1#|
11083|#&7$Omar##br#
"So much has happened; I thought this ceremony wouldn't finish. Not only did it happen, but it ended smoothly, and it's all thanks to your hard work, %n%."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Look at me, I'm rambling like an idiot. You have more important things to do than listen to me talk, I'm sure. I've already opened the Treasure Chest. Here, take it before I change my mind." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Excited, you open the unlocked Starlight Treasure Chest. It contains Ancient Machinery, its parts in disarray.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"My, that looks quite old... and quite damaged."#br##br#
#&53$Omar scrutinizes the contents of the chest.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Helonia has safeguarded this chest for a very long time, with the key hidden in the Altar of the Moon. Whatever this is must be very important."#npc$$821$1#|
11084|To express his gratitude, Omar asks you to conduct the ceremony. 

Go to the Altar of the Moon and use the Crescent Gem to carry out the ceremony.|
11091|#&7$Omar##br#
"When I was younger, I once heard someone say that there was a kind of ancient machine that can dispel spirits. Perhaps this is it."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your heart nearly skips a beat upon hearing this news; you eagerly ask if there's anyone in the village who can repair the machine.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Hmm, well, judging from how it looks, I'd say this machine was built by Dwarves..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Hey, Paolo! Where are you? Come out here a moment!"#br##br#
#&53$Omar turns to scream out Paolo's name.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"I'm here already! Geez..."#br##br#
#&53$Paolo scurries over to Omar's side.##M050011s85h+70$Paolo$101$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"Is something wrong?"#M050011$Paolo$823$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
#&53$Carefully, Omar removes the damaged machine from the Starlight Treasure Chest and passes it over to Paolo.##br##br#
"You're a Dwarf, and this thing looks like it was made by Dwarves. Perhaps you can fix it?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
#&53$Paolo carefully turns the machine over in his hands as he observes it.##br##br#
"Dwarves did, indeed, make this contraption, but it was made a very long time ago. This thing's a relic. Unfortunately, I don't know much about ancient craftsmanship." #M050011$Paolo$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Ya hear that, %n%? There's gotta be a Dwarf out there somewhere that knows how to fix one of their outdated products. Take the machine to Brevis, where the Dwarves live." #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"This is a good time to visit my home town in the Cactakara Forest, %n%! Brevis should be in the middle of their annual Robot Competition right about now."#br##br#
#&53$Paolo looks at you with clear excitement.##M050011$Paolo$824$0#

#&7$Paolo##br#
"Everyone there will be ridiculously busy, but you may luck out in finding someone to help you with that machine. Seek out the village chief, Alain, and tell him that you're a friend of Paolo."#M050011$Paolo$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You graciously take the damaged machine from Paolo, ready to set out to Cactakara Forest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Ready to go already, I see. Well, about time I thank you, %n%, for all you've done for our village. Hopefully the Dwarves in the Cactakara Forest can help you with your problem."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$You will face tougher challenges once you arrive at the Cactakara Forest. Please upgrade your skills to prepare for the adventure ahead. Training from Mirabelle's Bulletin Board or in Alabastren Temple is recommended.#|

"Oh! I almost didn't notice you there! What brings you to these parts?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the Brevis Chief that Paolo advised you to come here.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Well, then welcome to the Cactakara Forest! It's been ages since I last saw Paolo. How's he been? Is he holding up well in Crescent Hill?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You and Alain fall into light conversation about Paolo, then you cut to the point. You must find someone who can fix your machine.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Sure thing, lets have a look..."#br##br#
#&53$Alain carefully collects the Broken Machinery, inspecting it carefully.##npc$$2$1#|
11094|You've found Broken Ancient Machinery within the Starlight Treasure Chest. Omar suggests that you take it to Cactakara Forest, where you may likely find a skilled Dwarf to fix it. 

Go to Cactakara Forest.|

"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I've never seen anything like this before. It is quite fascinating, though..." #npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"You came at a bad time. The most important event in Brevis, the Robot Competition, just entered the finals. As the host, I'm afraid I don't have the time to study your machine."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're crestfallen, but also interested in this Robot Competition. Despite your disappointment, you ask Alain about it.##char$$821$0##&PP00501#

#&7$Alain##br#
"It's a Brevis tradition; we control robots to do battle. All year, the craftsmen pour their hearts into these robots just so they can defeat other robots in the arena and earn the championship title. It's a very big deal here." #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$An idea comes to mind. You suggest about helping out in the competition in hopes that it would free up enough time for someone to take a look at your machine.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Say, that is a bright idea. There are a lot of things that need to be done around here, and you look like someone fit enough for the types of tasks I have in mind."#br##br#
#&53$Alain looks you over to confirm his statement.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Alright, first thing's first. We have a bit of a Grass Sprout problem. The finals will begin soon. The craftsmen are just implementing finishing touches, but those darn Sprouts keep rampaging into the village and eating our resources!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"They've drained all the energy from many of the participants' robots. Complaints have been coming in non-stop all day!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Alain how you could help in this situation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"If you can get rid of these pesky Grass Sprouts, I'll introduce you to some experts who can help you with that machine of yours. What do you say?"#npc$$821$1#|
11102|#&7$Alain##br#
"Most of the energy used to power our robots comes from natural resources, but there are creatures here who live off those same resources. They've been getting a little greedy lately, stealing from us." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"I'd say that's the only issue with our technology..."#br##br#
#&53$Alain sighs, frowning, clearly frustrated.##npc$$821$1#|
11103|#&7$Alain##br#
"I see it, but I still can't believe it! You did the impossible; you cleared the area of those Grass Sprouts!"#npcs85h+70$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Nodding, you begin to give Alain brief details on how you've driven off the Grass Sprouts that were gathering outside the village.##char$$822:71$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Perhaps later you can tell me more about your technique..."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Our technology is the perfect blend of magic and mechanics. However, that same energy is a food source for the Sprouts. Trying to fairly share our resources with the Sprouts has always been a huge pain."#npc$$2$1#|
11104|Alain promises that if you help him drive off the nearby Grass Sprouts, he will introduce you to several Craftsmen who could help you with your broken parts. 

Drive the Grass Sprouts further from the village.|
11111|#&7$Alain##br#
"Well, you've done a stellar job, so now it's time to fulfill my end of the agreement. Let me see who could be available to help you."#br##br#
#&53$Alain fishes a list out of his pocket, unfolding it. He carefully scrutinizes the list.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Ok, I think I know who can help you. Take your contraption to the village and have Renault, Saffron and Old Tom have a look. They are leaders in their specialized fields with several years of experience. If they can't help you, I don't know who can."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Excited, you repeat the names in your head, committing them to memory.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"No one understands mechanics better than Dwarves; that's a fact! The people I'm introducing you to are the best of the best tinkerers."#br##br#
#&53$Alain pulls back his shoulders with pride.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"As for my opinion, I've never seen such a machine before, but the model seems familiar. Hrmm, where have I seen something like this before...?"#npc$$821$1#|
11112|#&7$Alain##br#
"I'd suggest finding them before the finals begin. Once it starts, this place will be like a ghost town; everyone will be out watching the competition."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11113|#&7$Alain##br#
"That didn't take long! I'm sure you have plenty of answers now, after talking to our best! I'm curious, fill me in."#br##br#
#&53$Alain grins, an eager glint in his eyes.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Hesitantly, you tell Alain about what happened after you talked to the craftsmen.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"W-what? How is that possible? None of them know what this thing is? I don't know anyone that knows more about machines than they do. So, how...?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Oh, wait... Something just came to mind! I remember a young human girl, a few years back, asking me about a similar machine... How could that have slipped my mind? She didn't have it like you do, but she drew a picture of it. It looked so much like your machine; that's why it's so familiar to me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$There is hope yet! Someone else knows about the machine. You press Alain for more details.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"...Gosh, I was so busy then, it was all a jumble. There were so many spectators that visited the village that year; the competition then was electrifying! I didn't think that human girl a craftsman at all, just another spectator..." #npc$$2$1#|
11114|Alain has arranged for three Craftsmen to help you evaluate the level of damage your machinery has suffered. You need to go into the Village to speak with the Craftsmen. 

Ask Renault, Saffron, and Old Tom about the Ancient Machine.|
11115|#&7$Renault##br#
"'Sup, human?"#npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You approach Renault with what Alain had said, showing him the Broken Ancient Machinery from the Starlight Treasure Chest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Renault##br#
"The Village Chief himself sent you to me? Pretty gnarly."#br##br#
#&53$Renault smiles.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Renault##br#
"Well, lets crack this mystery! I gotta see what's so old and strange that old Alain can't identify."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After passing the Broken Ancient Machinery to Renault, he begins to examine it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Renault##br#
"Far out... I don't know what this thing is, either! I do remember someone asking me about it before, though. I was busy then, so I don't even remember who it was."#npc$$2$1#|
11116|#&7$Saffron##br#
"I am tremendously busy, what with the competition and all, but I suppose I can spare a few moments for...community service. What is your inquiry?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You show Saffron the Broken Ancient Machinery, hoping that seeing it would spark in her ideas on how to fix it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Saffron##br#
"Ah, simple. This machine is... No, wait, I retract that statement. In actuality,  it's a... wait, that is also an incorrect assumption."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Saffron##br#
"I must be truthful with you. I have no logical idea as to the identity of that machine. I am, however, confident enough to inform you that it will never work without a proper structure to hold energy."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$At least Saffron was able to say a little bit, but you don't know how accurate her statement is knowing she's never seen a machine like yours before. You can't help but feel a bit disappointed.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Saffron##br#
"I wish to submit an inquiry to you. Do you know Augustus, that pompous brute? I simply cannot believe someone as disorganized and dysfunctional as he is managed to get into the competition! I am still devising a solution as to how he managed this."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shake your head; you have no idea who Augustus is.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Saffron##br#
"What? How could you not know him? Hmm, then do you know Montero? He calls himself "White Knuckle Montero." He is this year's defending champion. I am 99.856% certain he will win again this year."#npc$$824$1#|
11117|#&7$Old Tom##br#
"Yeah, what do ya want? I'm busy here."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You show Old Tom the Broken Ancient Machinery, quickly telling him about your conversation with Alain.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Old Tom##br#
"Hmm... I've never seen anything like this before. Quite a hunk of junk you've got there. Perhaps it was part of a larger robot. I'd use it for spare parts."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Part of a larger machine? Interesting! Eagerly, you ask if he may know anything else about it.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Old Tom##br#
"... What, you thought I was actually serious! I was just spoutin' nonsense. I have no idea what that thing is, but I'd use it for spare parts. Even if I knew exactly what it was, you'd never have it fixed in time for this year's competition, or next year's. Let's talk about something more interesting! Do you know about last year's champion, Montero?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Old Tom##br#
"Montero seems decent. He's got a good head on his shoulders and is highly skilled. He's not an arrogant fool like Augustus. I hope people come to their senses and boot Augustus from the competition."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Shouldering your disappointment, you realize that talking with Old Tom is getting you nowhere. You politely listen for a few more minutes, then blurt out an excuse to leave.##char$$821$0#|
11121|#&7$Alain##br#
#&53$After seeing your disappointed expression, Alain scratches his head, wordlessly apologetic for not being able to find you proper help.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Well, I suppose you can meet Montero. He's last year's champion. He may know a thing or two, considering he won last year."#br##br#
#&53$Alain's demeanor brightens from this idea.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Problem is, he's very, very busy with this year's competition. He wants to keep his title for another year. If you pester him now, you'll delay his work, and I will be stuck with all the complaints."#br##br#
#&53$Alain sighs, now troubled.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$This Robot Competition seems to be everything to the people of Brevis. Perhaps Alain is right in his assumption that interrupting the champion's final preparations would cause unnecessary strife in the village.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Oh, I just remembered something! Not long ago, Montero asked me where he could find large quantities of Waterlight Mushrooms. He claimed to be testing out a new idea. I didn't think anything beyond that."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"If I recall, you'll find some Waterlight Mushrooms in a marshy area northeast of the village. If you collect some of those mushrooms for him, he may have a little time to take a look at your machine."#npc$$821$1#|
11122|#&7$Montero##br#
"Adjusting the viscosity of the pressure oil requires a large amount of Waterlight Mushrooms. If you ignore this equation, then you can't increase the torque..."#npc$$821$1#|
11123|#&7$Montero##br#
"Oh, I almost didn't see you there! I've been so busy... what is it that you need? I'm afraid I don't have a lot of time to chat, what with the finals coming up and all..."#M012020s85h+70$Montero$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After briefly introducing yourself, you hand the Waterlight Mushrooms to Montero, informing him that Alain referred you to him.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Fantastic! With these Waterlight Mushrooms, I can now rotate the turbine to its maximum! This really saves me some time!" #M012020$Montero$825$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Waterlight Mushrooms! Why ever would you waste your time with those things?"#br##br#
#&53$A Dwarf swaggers over to you, arrogance oozing out of every step.##M141010s85h+70$Augustus$3001$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Hello, Augustus. What brings you here?"#M012020$Montero$2$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I'm here to tell you something important! I'm the champion of this year's competition. Your fancy new equation doesn't stand a chance to my secret research!" #M141010$Augustus$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
Then I wish you luck. I'll be giving my all in this competition, just as I did last year,"#br##br#
#&53$Montero mutters as he returns to his work, already distracted.##M012020$Montero$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
Hah! You might as well save your energy because you're wasting it on a competition you won't win."#br##br#
#&53$With an arrogant chuckle, Augustus swaggers off.##M141010$Augustus$825$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You feel a bit perplexed by Augustus's appearance; who is that guy? Apparently, he is one of the Robot Competition's finalists.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"His name is Augustus. Don't mind him, he's always like that. Though, I'll have to admit that he may have a shot at the championship this year."#M012020$Montero$2$1#

#&7$Beebis##br#
#&53$While Montero returns to his work, Beebis approaches, attempting to swallow whole an unguarded Waterlight Mushroom!##M216010s75h-10$Beebis$1$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$You move to try to stop the mischievous bird; fortunately, %p% is faster, able to relocate the Waterlight Mushrooms away from the ostrich's reach.##pet$$1020$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Hmm? Did you say something?"#br#
#&53$Montero turns his head to look at you, distracted enough to mistakenly think you had spoken to him. He clearly has no idea what almost happened to his mushrooms.##M012020$Montero$2$1#|
11124|Alain plans to introduce you to the last competition's champion, Montero. If you want his help, you have to collect some Waterlight Mushrooms as a gift. 

Go to the north of Brevis and collect some Waterlight Mushrooms to present to Montero.|
11131|#&7$Montero##br#
"You're %n%, right? Thanks for bringing me those Waterlight Mushrooms, that was a tremendous help. Gathering Waterlight Mushrooms this time of year is such a time sink because of those annoying Moss Crabs!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"I don't know why such a large group of Moss Crabs have migrated here of all places. Only Augustus' little brother, Fenrich, is interested in that sort of thing."#br##br#
#&53$Montero mixes hydraulic fluid as he talks.##npc$$1001$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Everyone else is thinking about the competition, including me. When it comes to those crabs, all that worries me is that they're eating all the Waterlight Mushrooms. I will not lose the competition that way..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$As Montero continues to rant, %p% looks at you, anxious to interrupt Montero so that you can get to the point.##pet$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You have similar thoughts on the matter, but Montero isn't even focused on you anymore. As he talks, he goes back to tweaking his own machine.##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"...If we don't get rid of those Moss Crabs, all the time I've spent on my new research will be wasted. This machine will become useless, all because of a lack of Waterlight Mushrooms."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"If you are the one Alain told me about, then get rid of those Moss Crabs for me. If I'm constantly worrying about being short on Waterlight Mushrooms, I may overlook a crucial detail that will cost me the competition." #npc$$828$1#|
11132|#&7$Montero##br#
"If the Moss Crabs devour all the Waterlight Mushrooms, the factory cannot produce any more special Pressure Oil, and I won't be able to prove my equation!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"It'd be a tremendous loss. My latest research could be a huge breakthrough for any craftsmen who work with machinery!"#npc$$821$1#|
11133|#&7$Montero##br#
"If the crabs consume all the Waterlight Mushrooms..."#br##br#
#&53$Montero mutters to himself, heaving a great sigh.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Montero what you've done about the Moss Crabs.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"So you cleared the area of Moss Crabs for the time being, yes? I'll add those crabs to the list of security concerns at the next village committee meeting. Well, I don't have anything else that you could help me with, so you can go back to--" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You interrupt Montero, firmly informing him that you came specifically for his help, not to be his personal assistant.##char$$821$0#|
11134|Moss Crabs north of Brevis are greedily consuming all the valuable Waterlight Mushrooms, thus making things very difficult for Montero. You have to devise a way to drive them off. 

Drive off the Moss Crabs north of Brevis.|
11141|#&7$Montero##br#
"Huh? Oh, we must have come to a misunderstanding! How embarrassing, I do apologize. My name is Montero. Thank you for your help. What do you need from me...?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Finally. You tell Montero everything that has happened, showing him the Broken Ancient Machinery in hopes that he can help you fix it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Hmm...this is not a modern machine. It's ancient, actually, but its structural design is more advanced than anything I've ever seen. You say you have no idea what it's for?"#br##br#
#&53$Montero's full attention is now on your machine as he examines it with steadfast interest.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shake your head, unsure of what he is muttering about, and tell him that no one else in the village has seen a machine like this one before.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"These lines...those symbols... This is Dwarven work, but not from anyone in this area, or anywhere else that I know of..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"It's a pity this thing is so damaged. See these cracks here? The outer casing has expanded from heat, indicative of some sort of explosion. The heat changed the shape of the shell and damaged the structure."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$That doesn't sound good. Perhaps fixing it is hopeless...##char$$1$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"I wouldn't worry just yet. It may be easiest, in this case, to work from the outside in. We'll focus on the shell first, then figure out how to repair the inside."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Goat Horn Powder should do the trick in repairing the shell. After we pressurize the powder, we can form a new shell. I'll need your help in gathering the powder, though. While you do that, I can convert one of my machines into a high energy pressurizer."#npc$$821$1#|
11142|#&7$Montero##br#
"You can find the Goats to the north of the village. But those creatures won't just hand over their horns. You'll have to - well, let's just say they'll make you work for it."#br##br#
#&53$Montero snickers.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11143|#&7$Montero##br#
"Ok! My compressor is warmed up and ready to go! I've made sure it's in top form, so all I need is the powder."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Montero the Goat Horn Powder.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Excellent! The last detail! Leave the rest to me!"#br##br#
#&53$Montero grins, then turns to work, fully engrossed in this latest project.##npc$$821$1#|
11144|Montero believes the machine exploded, severely damaging it. He plans to start repairing it by concentrating on the outer casing first. However, he needs you to collect some materials. 

Obtain Goat Horns from the Floppy-Eared Goats or Horned Goats north of Brevis, then grind them into a fine powder.|
11151|#&7$Pierre##br#
"Greetings, my name is Pierre. I am Augustus's assistant. Augustus sent me to deliver a message. I hope you can spare a few moments of your time for me."#npcs85h+70$$822$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Mr. Augustus is committed to the research of ancient, forgotten energy resources. As such, he is very interested in your machine."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Furthermore, Mr. Augustus is aware of your talents. He believes you will be an efficient robot operator."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Pierre's proposal is sudden, perplexing, and a little creepy. However, it sounds like Augustus knows more about the machine than anyone else. Perhaps accepting the proposal would not be a bad idea...##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"%n%, simply stated, Augustus would like to work with you. You offer the machine to him to study and agree to operate his robot. In exchange, he will fix the 'Spirit Separator' that you have in your grasp."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your heart skips a beat; Pierre has an actual name for the machine from the Starlight Treasure Chest!##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"In order to express his sincerity in cooperating with you, Mr. Augustus would like for me to share with you a detail about your machine. He says that Village Chief Alain possesses a book with ancient text that reads, 'The Brevis Workmanship Collection.' This book contains blueprints for machinery that has been passed down through the generations."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Everyone considers Alain's package to be outdated, irrelevant. No one looks closely at what is written within the text. If you can manage to borrow this book from Alain, you will learn that Mr. Augustus is really the only one who can help you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I have reported the entirety of Mr. Augustus's message. I await your decision."#npc$$821$1#|
11152|#&7$Pierre##br#
"As far as I know, everyone seems to think this book is too old and that its technology cannot be utilized in this modern age."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"However, Mr. Augustus believes that our ancestors were trying to send us a message with this book. He believes they used this tome to pass down their knowledge crystal, 'Kinetics,' to us."#npc$$821$1#|
11153|#&7$Pierre##br#
"You have the book? Please give it to me, post haste."#npcs85h+70$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Pierre the Brevis Workmanship Collection.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
#&53$After turning a few pages, Pierre's expression shifts to excitement. He points to a page in the text for you to see. There is a mysterious machine diagram drawn on the page. The machine in the picture looks exactly like your Broken Ancient Machinery from the Starlight Treasure Chest.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"%n%, this is the original design for your machine. I have never seen this book, but Mr. Augustus seems very familiar with it. Mr. Augustus's assumptions are confirmed. This is the Spirit Separator. But what is it used for?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"No matter. We have confirmed that this machine was designed by our ancestors. Mr. Augustus is the only one who can fix it because his research on the lost knowledge of the ancestors allows him to."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$This may cause problems. You tell Pierre that Montero is currently fixing the Broken Ancient Machinery.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"You and Montero are both wasting your time. Mr. Augustus is the only one who can repair it. Montero's skill and knowledge is limited to modern technology only. At best, he may be able to repair the damaged shell."#br##br#
#&53$You can't help but notice the agitation in Pierre's voice upon mention of Montero.##npc$$826$1#|
11154|Augustus's assistant, Pierre, discreetly seeks you out to inform you that Augustus is the only one who can repair the Broken Ancient Machinery. He insists that you borrow a book on ancient technology from Alain. Perhaps it will contain the answers you seek. 

Borrow "The Brevis Workmanship Collection" from Alain.|
11155|#&7$Alain##br#
"The Brevis Workmanship Collection? What ever do you want that for?"#br##br#
#&53$Alain narrows his eyes suspiciously.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Taking a deep breath, you tell Alain about the suggestions and ideas from Pierre and Augustus.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Hmm...maybe Augustus's conclusion is correct, for once. Your Ancient Machinery might be something built by our ancestors, but the energy sources they used have been lost for a long time. Even if we reconstructed the machine to the last detail, we would never be able to power it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"However, if you think this book offers clues, go ahead and borrow it. I see no harm done by doing so."#npc$$821$1#|
11161|#&7$Montero##br#
"%n%, you've returned just in time! I've already repaired the outer shell! Take a look, it's like new!"#br##br#
#&53$Montero proudly shows off his work.##npcs85h+70$$825$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"As much as I've done with the exterior, I can't can't seem to figure out the inner mechanics. Some sort of energy source is causing interference."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Whatever that means! You ask Montero what he plans to do about the issue.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"I want to see what insulation material will do to this. Unfortunately, I don't have anything that will fit inside this machine, but a Fanged Crocodile Scale should work nicely."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Most of the Fanged Crocodiles live east of the Competition Arena. They are very, very dangerous, though. If you're going to go out to get one, you must be very careful, otherwise...you will be eaten."#npc$$821$1#|
11162|#&7$Montero##br#
"It boggles the mind. How did this machine run, exactly? I can't figure out how it was powered,"#br##br#
#&53$Montero mutters, his brow furrowed.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11163|#&7$Montero##br#
"Excellent, give it here!"#npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&53$You have just come back with a Fanged Crocodile Scale; Montero can barely contain his excitement to use it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
#&53$After taking a moment to flip power switches, Montero turns his attention to the repair work.##npc$$2011$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
#&53$After a bit of fiddling, Montero reassembles all the machine's parts.##npc$$1001$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Okay... I'm not completely sure I've got it right, but we'll see what happens."#br##br#
#&53$Montero releases a nervous chuckle.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
#&53$After a great pause, Montero flips the main power switch.##npc$$2012$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hold your breath and watch, but the machine is completely motionless.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"..." #br##br#
#&53$Montero snorts disapprovingly and flips the switch again.##npc$$2012$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The machine is a paperweight. Except for its shiny new exterior, it is still the same old Broken Ancient Machinery.##char$$829:75$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Oh, blast it all! There's nothing else I can think of to do. This machine may be beyond my scope of capability. I can't grasp how its drive system works or what exactly it uses for energy."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Well, the Finals are about to begin. I should get back to working on what's important. You should take that machine to someone else. I'm really sorry I couldn't help you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You release a sigh and leave Montero's cottage. Augustus's assistant, Pierre, was right. Even though Montero is highly skilled, he just doesn't have what it takes to fix the machine.##clean$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, that Dwarf, Pierre, seemed confident that Augustus can fix this machine. How about we go visit him?"#pet$$821$1#|
11164|Montero has reached an impasse. He has repaired the outer casing, but he can't figure out how to activate the core. He decides to use a Fanged Crocodile Scale to enhance the core's insulation. 

Go east of the Competition Arena and look for Fanged Crocodiles. Obtain their Scales, then bring them back.|
11171|#&7$Alain##br#
"%n%, glad you're back! I've got a favor to ask of you."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"I just received a report from Competition Arena security that Fanged Crocodiles are hunting in the area. This will definitely hinder the championship finals."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Our weapons are useless against the lizards' armor. If we can't even damage them, how are we to drive them off?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Fanged Crocodiles normally don't hunt at this time; I don't know why they're doing so now. In times past, when we've needed to use the arena during their hunting time, we'd just wait for them to finish. This year's competition is intense. It would be catastrophic to postpone it now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"So, I was wondering if you could go east of the Competition Arena and get rid of those Fanged Crocodiles. I'd pay you for your efforts, of course. Do we have a deal?"#npc$$821$1#|
11172|#&7$Alain##br#
"The Fanged Crocodiles can resist our electronic weapons. Unless we find a way to modify our equipment, we're doomed to battle those beasts until the day we die."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"We need to change the focus of our technology and start working on improving our artillery. It's the only way to neutralize the threat of the Crocodiles."#npc$$821$1#|
11173|#&7$Alain##br#
"You took care of them? I love your efficiency!"#br##br#
#&53$Alain grins.##npcs85h+70$$824$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Here is your payment. I added a bit extra. You deserve it."#npc$$821$1#|
11174|Alain explains that the finals will begin soon, but the Arena Security Officer fears that the Crocodiles pose a threat because they have begun their feeding period. Both he and Alain worry that the fearsome Crocodiles may prevent the audience from entering the Arena. Thus, Alain asks you to help get rid of the Crocodiles. 

Go to the east of the Competition Arena and eliminate the Leathery Crocodiles and Fanged Crocodiles.|
11181|#&7$Pierre##br#
"%n%, welcome. What was Montero's progress on your machine?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Pierre that Montero could fix the shell of the machine, but not its power system. Pierre is right in his assumptions about Montero.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I will therefore assume that you now wish to work with Mr. Augustus. We have determined what the machine is used for, but we still need to learn what sort of power it uses."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Mr. Augustus has a hunch that your machine uses Halo Energy to function, but he is still theorizing this sort of power. The idea is derived from ancient legend. It has yet been used in practice."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It sounds like Augustus knows a great deal about ancient machinery, but hasn't been able to test his theories yet. The other craftsmen of Brevis think that such theories will never amount to anything.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"We have learned that Halo Energy may be tied to Halo Grass. Halo Grass causes a special reaction when combined with Bright Colored Dust from Butterfly Fairies. It's the only way to test our theory on Halo Energy."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"%n%, I must ask you to please retrieve some Bright Colored Dust. You can obtain it from the Butterfly Fairy."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"As you are collecting the Dust, please also deliver this Finals Ticket to Fenrich. I think he'll be... Quite pleased."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Fenrich is Mr. Augustus's younger brother. He should be conducting research near Alba Shoal. He cares little about the Robot Competition, but his brother is in the finals, so he should make an appearance."#npc$$2$1#|
11182|#&7$Pierre##br#
"If Mr. Augustus is correct, all you need to do is spread the Bright Colored Dust on the machine so that it may better absorb Halo Energy."#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Remember that this has not been tested, so actual results may differ from expectations."#npc$$821$1#|
11183|#&7$Pierre##br#
"Commencing the first experiment with Bright Colored Dust!"#npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
#&53$Pierre sprinkles the Dust on the Broken Ancient Machinery. After a moment, the machine begins to emanate a faint glow.##npc$$2012$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You and Pierre exchange looks of surprise upon seeing the glow. Augustus's theory seems spot-on so far. The Spirit Separator seems to be reacting with the Bright Colored Dust, which means it should use Halo Energy for power.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Excellent! Brilliant! Mr. Augustus is truly amazing!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"%n%, your machine was, indeed, made by our ancestors. It uses Halo Energy for power. This is a major breakthrough on the research!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p%, nearby, carefully studies the machine.##br##br#
"This machine, when fully functional, should be able to separate Eidolons from their hosts."#pet$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask %p% what else it knows in relation to this.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"All things possess the Power of Gaia. This machine, once fixed, will have the ability to manipulate Eidolons, returning them to where they originated from."#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You fall into a contemplative silence upon %p%'s words. This will mean that %p% will disappear after you use the machine. However, if you don't use the machine, you might turn into a frightening abomination.##char$$826:75$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A bright beam of light is cast upon you, pulling your attention from your thoughts. Instinctively, you look towards the direction of the light.##char$$4$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A young human girl who you've never seen before walks towards you like a wraith in a dream. Her gaze seems fixated on the machine in your hands, a hand outstretched as though to touch it...##M124030$$3001$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"%n%, what is happening?"#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You blink and shake your head as though waking from a dream, apologizing for being distracted. The mysterious girl is nowhere to be found.##char$$807:0$0#|
11184|Augustus invites you to collaborate with him. He agrees to help you determine what kind energy the Ancient Machine used, but you'll need to obtain some testing materials first. He also asks that you deliver the Finals Ticket to Fenrich. 

Go to the southern bank of Rarnor Falls and look for the Butterfly Fairies. Snatch up their Bright Colored Dust and deliver the Finals Ticket to Fenrich.|
11185|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"You actually agreed to be my brother's assistant? If I remember right, Pierre is the only one who always hangs around him."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich gives you a curious stare.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Fenrich everything that has happened, including the fact that Augustus is in the Finals. You also give him the Finals Ticket.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"What's this? A ticket...How many times do I have to tell him before he finally understands? I have absolutely no interest in robots."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich sighs, shaking his head in frustration.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Anyway, you mentioned something about dust. Butterfly Fairies can be found south of Alba Shoal. You better be careful, though. They won't give up their Dust willingly."#npc$$821$1#|
11191|#&7$Pierre##br#
"We have confirmed that the Halo Energy is coming from this direction. We must ensure that Mr. Augustus's plan is executed smoothly."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I cannot help but voice a concern. Earlier, Mr. Augustus sent some collectors to gather Halo Grass in the mountain path of the East City Ruins."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"They should have returned by now, but we still have not heard from them. They must have gotten lost in the forest."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Mr. Augustus knows of the situation. He said that the workers took two teleporters with them. You just need to follow the wave frequency readings and you can find their locations."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Finding them is one thing, but what else needs to be done?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I'm glad you asked. I have a plan. Consider it basic controller training. After all, as Mr. Augustus's operator, if you cannot confidently control robots during the Finals, we will lose."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
#&53$Pierre hands you two armfuls of unusual-looking devices.##br##br#
"This is a fantastic opportunity for you to gain experience. This Halo Energy Detector can launch a sweep of wave frequencies. You can use it to locate Halo Grass and the Teleporters."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Please take the instrument to survey the area near the Mountain Path. Do this right away; the Finals will begin soon, and we still have no Halo Grass! It is imperative that this issue does not delay Mr. Augustus!"#npc$$829$1#|
11192|#&7$Akers##br#
"What should I do?" #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11193|#&7$Akers##br#
#&53$The dwarf before you looks jittery and anxious with worry.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Akers of the route you've taken to get here and that you were sent by Pierre to find them. You then urge him to hurry and prepare the Halo Grass since there isn't much time before the finals begin.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akers##br#
"If we could go back, we wouldn't still be here. I don't want to stay in this terrible place! We didn't get lost and we did find an area where Halo Grass grows. Our problem is that there's some sort of malfunction with this stupid teleporter!"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"If we knew that this was just a piece of junk, we would have spent some money to rent a proper teleporter from the craftsmen. We should have known better than to trust anything built by Fenrich."#npc$$821$1#|
11194|The workers who were sent to collect Halo Grass haven't returned. Pierre believes they have gotten lost. He asks you to use the Detector to locate Halo Grass, then help the workers find it. 

Use the Halo Energy Detector to find Halo Grass, then give the  map of the locations to the Collectors.|
11201|#&7$Akers##br#
"I came here with my partner, Ivan, to collect Halo Grass. Ivan, however, was determined to go into the East City Ruins to find more Halo Grass. We wanted to avoid the dangerous Giant Woodbeasts, so we set up a Teleporter here."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Who would have guessed that after a few teleports, we'd suddenly lose the signal from the unit in the ruins. I haven't seen Ivan since."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Giant Woodbeasts prowl the Mountain Path. A mere Collector is no match for those vicious monsters."#br##br#
#&53$Akers looks you up and down.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"You look like you're a force to be reckoned with. Maybe you can rescue my partner. Would you go to the Mountain Path to save Ivan?"#npc$$821$1#|
11202|#&7$Akers##br#
"Ivan and I have risked our lives together for many years. He's always been my most trusted partner and friend. I can't bear to lose him this way."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11203|#&7$Akers##br#
"Have you found Ivan? Staying here waiting...I can't stand it!"#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Akers of the giant centaur on the mountain path blocking your way.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Centaurs? Could it be Vhell?! He is the leader of the centaur guards of the East City Ruins. Something must have happened to drive him out of there."#npc$$823$1#|
11204|Akers's partner, Ivan, has gone missing. Akers is frightened to go after him, as dangerous Giant Woodbeasts lurk on the Mountain Path. He asks you to help look for Ivan. 

Defeat the Tough Woodbeasts and Giant Woodbeasts on the Mountain Path near the East City. Next,  follow the path to learn more about the situation.|
11211|#&7$Akers##br#
We have to be careful not to anger those Centaurs. Otherwise, Ivan... he will definitely..."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"The teleporter!"#br##br#
#&53$Akers's eyes widen with his sudden idea.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"That's it! If we fix the teleporter, we can teleport somewhere behind Vhell."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You comment that fixing the teleporter is more likely to alert Vhell.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akers##br#
"I know, but I've got a plan! If we dress up like Giant Woodbeasts, we might be able to trick Vhell and fix the other teleporter."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"To disguise yourself as a Giant Woodbeast, you'll need a few things from them. Let's see... Bark, leaves and branches. That's pretty much it."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Once you have the materials, we'll assemble them together into a great disguise. I'll leave the gathering up to you. There's no way I can survive an encounter with a Giant Woodbeast, but I can try to fix the teleporter while you're gone."#npc$$821$1#|
11212|#&7$Akers##br#
"Why do the East City Guards want to stop us from following the Mountain Path? Collecting Halo Grass is just what we do; it's nothing out of the ordinary. Could Ivan have done something to provoke them?"#npcs85h+70$$828$1#|
11213|#&7$Akers##br#
"Let me see..."#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You reveal the completed Treeman Camouflage. From the outside, it looks just like a Giant Woodbeast.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akers##br#
"I had no idea you're so multi-talented! This Woodbeast costume looks just like the real thing. Let me just make a few minor adjustments..."#br##br#
#&53$Akers reaches out to take the Treeman Camouflage.##npc$$2011$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Oh wow! Why is this thing so heavy?"#br##br#
#&53$Akers grunts and strains to lift the disguise, but it doesn't budge.##npc$$501$1#|
11214|In order to prevent a confrontation with East City Guard's Vhell, Akers plans to disguise yourselves as Woodbeasts. 

Obtain Resilient Bark, Giant Tree Leaves and Giant Tree Branches from the Giant Woodbeasts to make a Treeman Camouflage.|
11221|#&7$Akers##br#
"I never thought...this Treeman Camouflage... would be so impossibly heavy! It's... it's not something... any normal person could wear..."#br##br#
#&53$Akers is still trying to pick up the disguise, to no avail.##npcs85h+70$$501$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Eh, nevermind. We just need to somehow sneak around Vhell, find that blasted teleporter and restart it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"I was going to fix the teleporter, but as you can see, I can't even lift this disguise to put it on."#br##br#
#&53$Dejected, Akers lets go of the Treeman Camouflage.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"%n%, that means you'll have to disguise yourself and restart the teleporter. Don't worry, it's easy. Just press the button on the teleporter and it'll fire up."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"You're gonna need time to put on that stupid disguise. Let me know when you're good to go."#npc$$821$1#|
11222|#&7$Akers##br#
"Did everything go as planned? Teleporters are usually set up in open areas. Hopefully, they won't be difficult to find."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11223|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Akers about what happened with the teleporter in the East City Ruins, confirming that it has restarted.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Of course it was broken... Fenrich's machines are always so unreliable. I will never use anything of his again."#npcs85h+70$$828$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"I had hoped you had also found Ivan. Any clues to where he is?"#npc$$821$1#|
11224|You need to disguise yourself as a Woodbeast to fool Vhell and sneak into the Ruins to fix the Teleporter. 

Disguise yourself as a Woodbeast, follow the mountain path, and restart the Teleporter.|

#&7$Akers##br#
"Ivan has taken survival training, so maybe he's hiding somewhere safe."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"I worry that with so many Centaurs patrolling the Ruins, he'll eventually be discovered no matter how good a hiding place it is."#br##br#
#&53$Akers gazes at the East City Ruins, his body tense with worry.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Guess we better start now before the Teleporter screws up again."#br##br#
#&53$Akers releases a shaky sigh, then gives you a formal salute.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$This confuses you; you are not Akers's superior. The look he gives you - of desperate hope - is somehow humbling and unsettling at once.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Ivan##br#
"She had something with her, but, before I could ask, a bunch of Centaurs came out of nowhere and started attacking me!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ivan##br#
"I'd heard that Centaurs were ruthless and violent, but I'd always thought those stories were exaggerated! Apparently not! I've been hiding out since then. I'm glad you found me."#npc$$828$1#

"As the Centaurs chased me, I dropped my Collection Bag filled with the Halo Grass I had collected. I'd like to go back and find it, but a particularly large Centaur snatched it up and took it away."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Ivan##br#
"To be honest, I didn't have quite enough Halo Grass in there; I'll still need more. So, um, I was wondering... could you retrieve my Collection Bag for me?"#npc$$821$1#

#&53$You fill Pierre in on what happened with Akers and Ivan, giving him the Collection Bag from Ivan.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"It is good that they are safe. Mr. Augustus is a good man. I'm sure he will still pay them their due. It did not occur to me that such a simple task could become so complicated."#br##br#
#&53$Pierre glances off toward the East City Ruins, humbled.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I am glad it all worked out in the end."#br##br#
#&53$Pierre laughs drily, then puts the Halo Grass into his prototype pressure furnace.##npc$$1001$1#


#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You become more and more anxious as the machine begins to buzz and whir. If this energy can make the Spirit Separator work again, maybe you'll finally be free of your Eidolon.##char$$826:75$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Good! The energy extraction is complete!"#br##br#
#&53$Pierre pulls a small box from the machine and releases a cry of excitement.##npc$$824$1#|
11264|Tell Akers that Ivan is safe, and bring Ivan's Collection Bag back to Pierre. Explain to Pierre the reason for the late delivery and elaborate on the troubles the Collectors had along the way. 

After talking to Akers, bring Ivan's Collection Bag back to Pierre.

11265|#&7$Akers##br#
"Oh no, this can't be good... Where's Ivan? Don't tell me he was..."#npcs85h+70$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You assure Akers that Ivan is safe and will meet him very soon.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Thank goodness! I can finally give his wife some good news."#br##br#
#&53$Akers sighs with relief, then looks at your Collection Bag.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"Augustus better pay up after all this trouble. Sure, the delivery was a little bit late, but if Ivan hadn't agreed to help Augustus collect the Halo Grass, he wouldn't have put himself in danger."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Akers##br#
"And as for the competition, after everything we went through, that Halo Grass had better score him a championship!"#npc$$821$1#|
11271|#&7$Pierre##br#
"Competition time draws near, thus someone has to bring the Halo Energy Box to Mr. Augustus as soon as possible. Are you prepared?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"The power of the Halo Grass is the only thing that can prove Mr. Augustus's theory. It is also good to see his genius at work. Simply help me take this Energy Box to him."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take the Energy Box and turn to leave. Suddenly, Pierre calls you again.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I...I also have a rather private request. As you know, I want Mr. Augustus to emerge victorious in this competition."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Those who despise Mr. Augustus will see him in a different light when he wins. I want everyone to witness his victory."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod as Pierre continues.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Crocodiles lurk in the roads near the arena. They almost attacked me during my last venture. If we cannot get rid of them before the finals, the villagers will be too frightened to come."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Could you eliminate the Crocodiles near the Arena and give the Energy Box to Mr. Augustus? You're the only one capable of such a task."#npc$$821$1#|
11272|#&7$Augustus##br#
"What are they doing? Were they planning to wait until after the competition to give me the Halo Energy?"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus throws his hands in the air in agitation.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11273|#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%, you've come at last! Please tell me that's the Energy Box!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus drums his fingertips on his desk, nervous.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand him the Energy Box and tell him everything that transpired. Augustus only seems interested in the box, however.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Fine, fine, I get the gist of it. I'll give you back the Energy Box when the competition ends. Oh, and I'll fix your Spirit Separator, too."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus's face suddenly falls.##br##br#
"I fear the competition might be postponed, though. I've been waiting for this! I can't it be delayed!"#npc$$821$1#|
11274|The planned start time for the Competition Finals is growing closer. Pierre needs you to get rid of the Crocodiles that skulk about on the road to the Competition Arena. Otherwise, he fears they could attack helpless spectators. 

Get rid of the Carnivorous Crocodiles and Ferocious Crocodiles near the Competition Arena, then meet with Augustus.|
11281|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Have you talked to Lane before? He's the Hall Security Officer for the Arena, and he's in charge of all security. He's a bit hard-nosed, but he's a good guy."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"A few workers were injured in the forest, nothing serious, so why would Lane postpone the entire competition? Don't you think he's overreacting?"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I don't want things to get worse, of course, so I've decided to help the injured workers. I'm hoping that Lane will realize the finals can still go on."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus turns to you.##br##br#
"I've got an idea. Help me collect some Herb Beetles from the Shatterwall Hill; they can be used for a healing salve for the workers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I'll be here, working on the herb grinder. Sure, you have the grunt work, but building and inventing is no easy task, either!"#npc$$821$1#|
11282|#&7$Augustus##br#
"For some strange reason, he wants to delay the champion's glory, it seems. Why, I'm insulted!"#npcs85h+70$$826$1#|
11283|#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%, you're back at last! The herb grinder is all set. Now we just need whatever Medicinal Herbs you've got."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Medicinal Herbs to Augustus.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Ah, just what we need. Take my Herb Grinder and use it to make some quality medicine."#npc$$821$1#|
11284|Mysterious creatures viciously attacked Collectors near the Arena. Augustus asks you to collect some Medicinal Herbs to make a Medicinal Herbal Ointment to treat the workers' wounds and lacerations. 

Go to Shatterwall Hill, search for Herb Beetles, and collect the Medicinal Herbs from their bodies.|
11291|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Lane's a stubborn fellow, but he's no fool. Something must have happened to make him postpone the competition..."#br##br#
#&53$muses Augustus, tapping his chin.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I'd ask him for more information, but he'll just tell me to wait, like he always does."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus grumbles.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I've concocted the Medicinal Herbal Ointment. I'll let you be the hero. Apply the ointment to the injured Collectors. It'll ease their pain pretty fast."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"After you apply the ointment, can you ask Lane to elaborate on the situation? I want to know what on earth could throw off such a sacred competition."#npc$$821$1#|
11292|#&7$Lane##br#
"And you are...? If there's nothing you need, please go back to Brevis. It's not safe for you here."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11293|#&7$Lane##br#
#&53$Lane pins you with a suspicious stare, as though he doesn't already know what you're here for.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You greet Lane and hand him the rest of the Medicinal Herbal Ointment.##char$$822:71$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"Ah, so you're the one the workers are raving about, %n%. But why did you help them to begin with? Are you from the medical supply team?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Lane that it was Augustus's idea. He was fearful that the competition would be postponed.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"Ha! That's just like Augustus. His only concern is the competition. Unfortunately, his worst fear is about to be realized. I'm planning to postpone the finals until we can rid the Arena of those aggravating creatures."#npc$$821$1#|
11294|Augustus meticulously mixes the Medicinal Herbal Ointment and hands it to you. He asks that you to apply it carefully to the Collectors' injuries. He also requests that you talk to Lane to find out exactly what happened to the Collectors. 

Take the Medicinal Herbal Ointment and treat the Collectors' wounds. Report their condition to Lane afterward.|
11301|#&7$Lane##br#
"Since you asked, I guess I can fill you in,"#br##br#
#&53$Lane grunts gruffly.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"According to the workers, they were busily collecting when a girl they'd never seen just suddenly ran up to them. While everyone was wondering what was going on, a bunch of Centaurs ambushed them from behind."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The girl and the Centaurs remind you of the situation with Ivan. It seems the Centaurs are becoming more and more aggressive.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"The workers, in trying to flee from the chaos, fell or were jostled by the Centaurs. Some were even attacked directly."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I'm only telling you this because I know you've experienced rough battles before. My instincts tell me that you might just be able to drive the Centaurs away."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"If you're willing to take on this task, you may as well do the workers a favor, too. Bring back the Missing Tools they lost in the forest."#npc$$821$1#|
11302|#&7$Lane##br#
"What if the ferocious Centaurs attack the Arena during the competition? Think of all the spectators that could be hurt in the fray. How many would die?"#br##br#
#&53$Lane exclaims sadly, gazing at Shatterwall Hill with worry.##npcs85h+70$$828$1#|
11303|#&7$Lane##br#
"Centaurs appearing here, how bizarre..."#br##br#
#&53$Lane mutters to himself, contemplative.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Missing Tools to Lane and tell him what happened to the Centaurs.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"You really did it! I heard so much about you, but I didn't know it would all turn out to be true!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I hear you're piloting for Augustus. Is that so?"#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"How daring! I suppose there's no rule that says the pilot must be a Dwarf, but humans simply don't know their way around machinery like we do. Montero may just win this round."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"You probably don't know much about Augustus and Fenrich. They're brothers, but in many ways, they are rivals, as well. One researches an ancient energy that cannot be implemented in today's society, and the other is obsessed with ecological studies."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You purse your lips, wondering if Augustus could really rediscover ancient energy.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"He insists on using ancient technology, but the fact remains that he hasn't won a match in years. This time, he's made it to the finals. We'll see what happens next!"#npc$$2$1#|
11304|According to the Injured Workers, a pack of East City Guards came to Shatterwall Hill. They chased a young girl and wound up attacking the Collectors. The workers ask you to head to Shatterwall Hill to retrieve the Missing Tools they dropped. 

Drive away the East City Hunters and bring back the Missing Tools.|
11311|#&7$Lane##br#
#&53$Lane sneers as he voices his opinion on Augustus's research; he does not believe Augustus will win this year's competition.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You open your mouth to defend and vouch for Augustus when a dwarf approaches, breathless from running.##char$$827:80$0#

#&7$Forest Patrolman##br#
"Lane! Lane, there's a problem!"#M050041s85h+70$Forest Patrolman$101$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"Yes, what's wrong? Take a deep breath, speak slowly..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Forest Patrolman##br#
"That same group of Centaurs has already regrouped at Shatterwall Hill. They look more fired up than they did before."#br##br#
#&53$The Patrolman leans forward to catch his breath, his hands trembling in distress.##M050041$Forest Patrolman$829$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"The only reason those Centaurs are bothering us is because of that girl... what did she do to anger them like this?"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Forest Patrolman##br#
"That's not all...this time there seems to be a larger Centaur leading them all like a commander to an army troop. I think they're going to raid us!"#M050041$Forest Patrolman$828$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"...It has to be Vhell..."#br##br#
#&53$You and Lane voice this aloud at the same time.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$That Centaur must be Vhell, the one who blocked the entrance to the East City Ruins. He was so formidable that you had to disguise yourself as a woodbeast just to get around him.##char$$826:0$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"If we want to get out of this pickle, we need to defeat Vhell, but it will be very difficult to take him on alone let alone the rest of them."#br##br#
#&53$Lane sighs, then looks to you.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Blanching, you vigorously shake your head. If anyone's going to take Vhell on, it's not going to be you; you know nothing about fighting such a creature!##char$$807:80$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Oh %n%, you jokester. My pilot would never actually say something so discouraging."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus swaggers over with his trademark arrogance.##M141010s85h+70$Augustus$3001$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Dealing with Vhell will be ridiculously easy with this!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus presses a small gadget into your hands.##M141010$Augustus$822$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"This excellent piece of machinery is called a Shrink-Ray. Just focus the beam of power that comes out of this thing on Vhell and it'll weaken him. Then all you'll need to do is give him a good sucker punch."#M141010$Augustus$2$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"The thing isn't going to work with you just standing there! Go and give it a shot! Show Lane how powerful of a team you and I are; we'll wipe that stupid smirk clear off his face!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus chuckles, brimming with confidence.##M141010$Augustus$825$1#|
11312|#&7$Lane##br#
"Everyone knows that Vhell was born cruel and fierce. Even self-described 'extraordinary' adventurers who set out to look into the secrets buried in the East City Ruins were slaughtered in cold blood by Vhell."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"Some people even steer Battle Robots to fight Vhell, but they always end up fleeing for their lives."#npc$$821$1#|
11313|#&7$Lane##br#
#&53$Lane turns to you as you approach.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Lane that you have defeated Vhell at last.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I saw it all. What a truly marvelous battle! When the Centaurs saw Vhell fall, they scattered and fled to the East City. The Arena is safe at last."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I must say, I'm truly surprised that the two of you worked together so well."#br##br#
#&53$Lane gives you and Augustus an approving, curt nod.##npc$$822$1#|
11314|To drive the Centaurs out of the Competition Arena, Lane tells you that you will first need to take out Vhell. Doing so will send a powerful message to the Centaurs. 

Aim the Shrink-Ray at Vhell, the East City Watchman, and defeat him.|
11321|#&7$Lane##br#
"Looks like we're really getting things done! We might finally get some peace and quiet around here."#br##br#
#&53$A tranquil smile spreads across Lane's face.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I need to entrust you with another important task: you must patrol the Arena,"#br##br#
#&53$Lane explains.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"It should be quite simple for you. I usually patrol the arena, but this time, you're going to take over."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"If the patrol is unsuccessful, we cannot hold a match. A Security Officer considers this task an honor, though it certainly comes with a heavy dose of responsibility."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I'm giving you this important job in part to apologize for how rude I was to you and Augustus. You've proven yourself very trustworthy indeed."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I'll speak to Augustus later. Hopefully, the match can be held as scheduled."#npc$$821$1#|
11322|#&7$Lane##br#
"%n%, this task is no joke. We can only hold the match if the patrol goes as planned. Oh, and I suppose the lives of our audience members hang in the balance, as well."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"The area you must patrol consists of mainly the Entrances and Exits to both sides of the arena, plus the audience stadium on the southern mountain."#npc$$821$1#|
11323|#&7$Lane##br#
"Ah, looks like you've finished your rounds."#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report the results of the patrol to Lane.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lane##br#
"So there are no problems? In that case, the Security Officer will declare the Arena safe, and the competition can officially begin!"#br##br#
#&53$Lane exclaims.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lane##br#
"I shall notify the arena committees and let them know that the Arena is ready. The finals can begin!"#npc$$821$1#|
11324|It is time for the final preparations. Lane trusts you to conduct the final patrol of the Arena. If everything is in order and safe, the final competition can begin. 

Conduct the final patrol of the Competition Arena for Lane.|

"%n%, I have already installed the Halo Energy Device in Augustus Mk.VII. Thanks for loaning me your materials for my research."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"More importantly, thanks for believing my ideas about Ancient Energy research. Lane made fun of my failures, which have led to crushing defeats. But you... you believed in me the entire time!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Augustus's heartfelt gratitude makes you blush. You tell him that you had faith in him the whole time.##char$$821$0#

"Thank goodness my pilot trusts me. I know we can win this."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus grins.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"The final match waits for no one. When you are ready, let me know."#npc$$821$1#

"Victory at last! Haha! Finally, I'm the champion! I'll be recognized by the world as a Master of Mechanical Craftsmanship!"#M141010$Augustus$825$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I would like to thank my pilot, %n%, and my dear assistant, Pierre! Thank you both so much, I couldn't have done it without you!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus smiles joyfully at you and Pierre. Is that a tear in his eye?##M141010$Augustus$822$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Congratulations, Augustus! After all these years, I...I can't believe it! We've done it!"#br##br#

"Augustus!"#br##br#
#&53$Montero saunters over, followed by his associates.##M012020s85h+70$Montero$3001$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"What is it now, Montero? I've won, fair and square!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus seems to be on high alert, afraid of what Montero is up to...##M141010$Augustus$1001$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Er...Congratulations, Augustus. The battle you fought today was...amazing."#br##br#
#&53$Montero and his fellow craftsman reach out to shake Augustus's hand.##M012020$Montero$822$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus is completely shocked! He never expected to be congratulated by Montero.##M141010$Augustus$823$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Excellent work on your research concerning Ancient Energy! You were right all along, my good man. This looks to be the most efficient and advanced energy we've ever developed! I would like to apologize, on behalf of the entirety of Brevis, for ever poking fun at your theories."#M012020$Montero$828$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Don't joke around with me, Montero! Without you as a worthy opponent I would never have had the drive to strive for greatness! You better not start slacking off!"#M141010$Augustus$2$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Hah! Of course not! You just wait. Next time we battle, I'll blow you out of the water!"#M012020$Montero$825$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus turns to look at you and gives a slight nod. He then removes the Halo Energy Device from Augustus MK.VII. and holds it out to you.##br##br#
"Here, %n%. As promised, I will give this to you..."#M141010$Augustus$821$1#

#&7$Mysterious Girl##br#
#&53$All of a sudden, a mysterious girl appears between you and Augustus! She quickly snatches the Halo Energy Device right out of his hands!##M124030$Mysterious Girl$52$0#

#&7$Mysterious Girl##br#
"Oh, so sorry! I'll just borrow this for a moment! Hee hee!"#br##br#

"...!"#clean$0#

"Wha-what happened?! Who was that?!#br##br#
#&53$Augustus snaps out of his shock and starts shouting with rage!##M141010$Augustus$823$1#|
11334|The competition finals are about to begin. You need to use Augustus's Robot to defeat all the other battle participants.

"Who was that? Are the security guards sleeping on the job? What's going on?!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus shrieks.##npcs85h+70$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You remember seeing the girl in Brevis. Back then, she was after your Spirit Separator.##char$$821$0#

"A human girl caused the commotion among the Centaurs in the East City Ruins and Shatterwall Hill. Maybe it was the same girl."#pet$$821$1#

"You're saying she's the one behind all this?"#npcs85h+70$$826$1#

"%n%, get me some of the Grass Sprouts who dwell near Alba Shoal. They are very sensitive to energy, especially Halo Energy."#npc$$821$1#

"Haven't you caught any Double Leaf Sprouts yet? They are near Alba Shoal, Even my brother has no trouble finding them. Go get a few, and hurry!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|

"Why are they so restless? Keep it down, you little fools!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$The Captured Grass Sprouts only struggle more fiercely, yelping like injured puppies.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus takes a step back, surprised.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"These creatures try my patience!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus growls fiercely.##npc$$826$1#|
11344|A Mysterious Girl snatched the critically important Energy Box right out of Augustus's hands. Augustus plans to use the Grass Sprouts' ability to sense energy to find the Box.

Take the Cloth Bag, and snag some nearby Double Leaf Sprouts.|
11351|#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus grabs a Grass Sprout from the bag. It whips itself into a frenzy and slips from his grip, racing around the place as though crazed.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"The energy in this neighborhood is apparently too messy and impure. The Grass Sprouts can't sense it properly; there are too many interruptions."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus pouts.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Looks like we need to go back to Ancient Brevis. The metal there carries a strong magnetic force which can isolate other kinds of EM wavelengths. It's okay if you don't understand; it's all very scientific."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%, have you visited the northeastern part of Ancient Brevis? Just follow the road and head northeast, and you'll eventually run into an abandoned village."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"If I remember correctly, a few of the first ever Robots are stored there, rusting away. You can get the Magnetic Metal I need from them."#npc$$821$1#|
11352|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Ancient Brevis has long been abandoned. Long ago, a highly skilled mechanic tried to build a superior robot. However, due to a glitch in his circuit board, a sudden surge of electricity pulsed through the village."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Suddenly, humans lost control of some of the robots, and the current continued to vibrate through the town, causing nearly daily electrocutions. Eventually, we had no choice but to move the village to its current location."#npc$$821$1#|
11353|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Ah, have you returned with the metal?"#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Power Storage Metal to Augustus.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus uses the Metal Plates to surround the Grass Sprout. It calms down for a moment, then completely loses control and dashes off to the northeast.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"You see? The magnetism blocks everything but Halo Energy. It was the most important discovery our ancestors made, and it continues to help us today."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"We just need to follow the Grass Sprout, and it'll lead us right to the thief."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus, satisfied, folds his arms in front of his chest.##npc$$825$1#|
11354|Augustus needs some magnetized Metal Plates to block other energies. Thus, he asks you to go to Ancient Brevis to look for Abandoned Robot Soldiers. You are tasked with removing the metal from their power storage units.

Go to Ancient Brevis, and obtain Power Storage Metal from the Abandoned Robot Soldiers.|
11361|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Just relax. I'm going to help the Grass Sprouts focus in on the energy, and then I'll use the positioning equipment to narrow down the girl's location. But it will take some time..."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"You know the Power Storage Metal you brought back? I'll use it to create a makeshift Simple Electrifier for you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Augustus what you were supposed to do with an Electrifier.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Don't you want to catch that girl? What are you gonna go, hit her with a rock and knock her out?"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus asks, amused.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I've almost pinpointed her location. Judging from these coordinates, she's hiding in the northern part of Alba Shoal, She can run, but she can't hide!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%, bring this with you, and test it out."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus hands you the Electrifier with a strangely crooked grin.##npc$$821$1#|
11362|#&7$Caroline##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
11363|#&7$Caroline##br#
"Enough! I'll give it back!"#br##br#
#&53$Caroline huffs, shoving the Energy Box at you.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Out of curiosity, you ask Caroline what she planned to do with the box.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Um, did you not see the Eidolon next to me? I heard that there was an instrument that could get rid of it, so I came here. Listen, I gave you what you wanted. Can I go now?"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You crook an eyebrow and tell Caroline that you have the same problem. You are looking for ancient machines for the the same reason. If all goes according to plan, you tell her you will lend her the machine.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"It never occurred to me that anyone else could...I mean, I always thought I was the only one."#npc$$828$1#|
11364|Augustus tells you to take his Simple Electrifier and use it to stun the Mysterious Girl. You will need to search her to find the Energy Box.

Use the Simple Electrifier to shock the Mysterious Girl. Find a way to get that Energy Box back to its rightful owner.|
11371|#&7$Caroline##br#
"I appreciate that you're willing to share your machine with me, but the energy contained in the Energy Box won't power an Ancient Machine."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
#&53$Caroline removes a scroll from her sleeve.##br##br#
"I stole this scroll from the East City Ruins. It contains the Dwarves' research on Halo Energy. This scroll is why the East City Guards are chasing me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod; indeed, Caroline is the reason the Ramhead Centaurs had left their base.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"On this scroll, it says that Halo Energy is hidden in the Secret Land. Halo Grass contains a small amount of energy, too; I suppose you could say it's been contaminated by Halo Energy."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"However, there are some parts in the scroll I don't understand. After all, I am not a craftsman. I think, though, that it might contain the formula for Halo Energy."#br##br#
#&53$She reluctantly hands you the scroll.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Please bring this to Augustus. In all of Brevis, I believe only he can decipher the formula."#npc$$828$1#|
11372|#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%, what happened? Did you catch that girl?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11373|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Have you captured her? Where is she?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Augustus the situation and give him the Ancient Scroll and Energy Box.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"This... this contains the formula for Halo Energy!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus's face lights up.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Maybe I could find it in my heart to forgive her."#br##br#
#&53$He claps his hands with utter glee.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Based on this incomplete formula, the machine won't run on the energy in the Energy Box."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"It all makes sense now. During the competition, I just knew the Halo Energy had some hidden potential. This scroll proves that my instinct was right."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"But I grew up in the forest, and I've never heard any such Secret Passageway mentioned. Can you find the energy source mentioned in the scroll? I will help you as much as I can."#npc$$821$1#|
11374|Caroline explains that the energy created by Augustus is not complete. She asks you to take the Energy Box and the Scroll that she stole from the East City Ruins to Augustus; she is confident he will know what to do.

Take the Energy Box and Ancient Scroll to Augustus.|
11381|#&7$Caroline##br#
"It's been a hard journey. I never dreamed that I'd spend half my life running and hiding."#br##br#
#&53$Caroline sighs helplessly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You comfort Caroline, patting her shoulder gently.##char$$822:71$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Maybe I should consider myself lucky that you're the one who caught me and not the Ramhead Centaurs. Otherwise, I guess I would have..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"I don't remember the last time I had a hot, decent meal. Could I ask you for a favor? Could you go hunting and get me some goat meat?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"I'm just too weak to go myself."#br##br#
#&53$Caroline looks up at you with a sad, weary smile.##npc$$821$1#|
11382|#&7$Caroline##br#
"I can't believe what I've become. I'm cursed. This Spirit won't leave me alone. It has ruined my whole life."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"I just want to have a warm meal in my stomach. And then I want to sleep for ages..."#npc$$821$1#|
11383|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Caroline all of the goat meat you obtained while hunting.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Thank you, %n%."#br##br#
#&53$Caroline's face lights up. Color returns to her pallid face.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"I don't understand. You've got an Eidolon, too. Why do you seem so calm about it?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You think for a moment, then tell Caroline that you actually quite like %p%. They have become a partner on the battlefield. You just have to hope you won't turn into a corrupt, demonic abomination, that's all.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"A partner? Maybe for now. But in the end, you're just a monster waiting to happen. And green skin just will not work with my complexion."#npc$$823$1#|
11384|Caroline hasn't rested or eaten for a long time. She asks you to bring back some Goat Meat for her.

Go to the northern part of the Alba Shoal, and hunt the Thin-Legged Goats and Ornery Goats. Bring the Tender Lamb and Lamb Ribs back to Caroline.|
11391|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Hmm? What's your plan?"#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Augustus if anyone knows the location of the Secret Passageway into Cactakara Forest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I've never seen it myself, but I'll bet Fenrich knows about it. He knows the ecology and make-up of the forest like the back of his hand."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I love him, but he just doesn't care about anything unless it relates to ecology. Unless you can link this to the environment, I doubt he'll make time to help."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus sighs.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I remember he once told me he wanted to collect eggs from Butterfly Fairies. He seemed intent on learning about the Fairies' ecological impact and their social structure. He couldn't stop talking about it. Boring, if you ask me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Perhaps if you go to the waterfall and collect Butterfly Fairy Eggs for him, he'll divulge the location of the Secret Passageway."#npc$$821$1#|
11392|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"What's going on? Why are the Butterfly Fairies acting like this? This runs completely counter to their nature!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11393|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Do you have something? This 'something' better be worth the waste of my time..."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich sends you a sour look, annoyed that you pulled him from his thoughts.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Fenrich the Butterfly Eggs you collected. He glares at you suspiciously.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"For me? Whatever it is, it better be worth this bothersome interruption, "#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich grunts.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"These...these are Butterfly Fairy Eggs! And they aren't contaminated!"#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich examines the eggs as though he is inspecting rare jewels.##br##br#
"How did you know that I wanted to get my hands on these?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain the situation to Fenrich.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Huh. I never thought Augustus actually listened to anything I said. It... It's actually really nice that he remembered. Do you think he's developed an interest in ecology?"#npc$$821$1#|
11394|Augustus thinks that his younger brother, Fenrich, might know the location of the Secret Cave Entrance discussed in the Ancient Scroll. Thus, he asks you to bring Fenrich the Butterfly Fairy Eggs that he desires in exchange for information.

Go to the northern part of the Rarnor Falls, and collect some Butterfly Fairy Eggs. Take the Eggs to Fenrich.|
11401|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"If you hadn't collected these Butterfly Fairy Eggs, the whole species might have gone extinct."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich looks at the eggs in awe.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Not long ago, I discovered that the Butterfly Fairies acted oddly. They became more and more aggressive, Some even began attacking one another, which is highly unusual in their society."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I examined the area's ecology and found an unknown, abnormal element in the pool around the waterfall. I fear this element is causing the Fairies to act so strangely."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are about to interrupt Fenrich to ask about the Secret Land, but %p% stops you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"This guy is kinda sensitive, and remember, he doesn't like interruptions!"#br##br#
#&53$%p% whispers to you.##pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, though you are surprised %p% would share such an insight. Not long ago, it was totally socially inept, and you had to keep reminding it about manners.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Unfortunately, the contaminated offspring of the Butterfly Fairies all carry this element within their blood. We've no choice but to destroy them all, or they will infect the other Fairies."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Will you help me restore balance to this environment?"#npc$$821$1#|
11402|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Unbelievable, an entire race, practically overnight, almost disappears completely from this forest. What a nightmare..."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11403|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"The beauty of the Butterfly Fairy is entrancing. Without your efforts, the stunning creatures might have disappeared entirely from Cactakara Forest."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Fenrich that you're happy to help preserve nature. However, you really came to get information from him about the Secret Land mentioned in the Ancient Scroll.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Secret Land? Never heard of it before. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, of course. Can you help me take care of these pressing ecological issues first? In return, I'll help you look for the passageway."#npc$$821$1#|
11404|Fenrich observes a problem with the water quality within the forest; drinking it changes the temperament of the Butterfly Fairies. To prevent further contamination, he asks you to get rid of all the infected Butterfly Fairies.

Eliminate all the Rainbow Butterfly Fairies and Wild Butterfly Fairies found around the north bank of Rarnor Falls.|
11411|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I conducted a complete survey on the ecological environment in the areas surrounding the Waterfall, but there's one thing I'm stumped on. Now that you mention a Secret Passageway, though, things are starting to come together."#npcs85h+70$$821$1##&PP00503#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I have never seen a Sarpa before. However, not long ago, a group of Sarpa suddenly gathered together near the Waterfall. I've no clue where they came from."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I attempted to communicate with them, but no matter what I said, they never responded."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich's shoulders sag.##br##br#
"They came after me and beat me bloody."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"If I remember correctly, though, the moment the Sarpa appeared coincides with the time the Butterfly Fairy began to mutate. Assuming that these Sarpa are the carriers of the mutational element... then..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"%n%, we need to do something before it's too late. Help me get some scales and blood from some Sarpa. We need to test the theory. If this really all comes back to the Sarpa, we're in big trouble."#npc$$821$1#|
11412|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"This won't be an easy task. Get blood samples from the Sarpa, and bring them back to me. Only then can we determine if they're the carriers of the unknown element or if the contamination comes from somewhere else entirely."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11413|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Quick, give me the Samples!"#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich prepares the instruments quickly.##npcs85h+70$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand over the sample to Fenrich, careful not to spill a ruby drop.##char$$828$0#|
11414|Fenrich learns that the polluted water might have something to do with the Sarpa. He asks you to stun some of the Sarpa, extract their Scales and Blood, and bring them to him for testing.

Obtain Scales from the Sarpa near Rarnor Falls. Additionally, use the Blood Extractor to obtain Blood Samples from them.|
11421|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"This is what I feared most,"#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich groaned, looking at the test results.##npcs85h+70$$828$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I found an ingredient in the Sarpa samples. It's similar to what's in Halo Grass, but about a hundred times more concentrated."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Caroline's words cross your mind. Halo Grass is just a plant contaminated by Halo Energy. Perhaps that's how the Sarpa are tainted.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"It's similar to the Butterfly Fairies. Any creature that comes in contact with this element suddenly becomes aggressive and violent."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"%n%, before things get any worse, we've got to wipe out the Sarpa entirely."#npc$$821$1#|
11422|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"This peculiar element must be what our ancestors used for energy. If that's the case, then the catastrophe..."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11423|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"For the sake of the forest as a whole, We have to make some sacrifices..."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich sighs deeply, his expression grave.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Fenrich about the outcome of your mission.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"It's a sad conclusion, but we did what was necessary for the greater good."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich sighs heavily.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"At least we've learned something from this. The Sarpa must've traveled to the area near the Waterfall via a secret passageway we have yet to find. Otherwise, they couldn't have appeared so suddenly."#npc$$821$1#|
11424|Fenrich's test results reveal that the Sarpa have been contaminated by something similar to Halo Grass. To protect the forest, you must eliminate every last one of the Sarpa.

Defeat the Wild Sarpa and Caustic Sarpa near Rarnor Falls.|
11431|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Found any clues?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Fenrich about what Caroline mentioned: the Halo Grass is just a regular plant tainted by energy.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Very true. We can also find the energy within Sarpa or Butterfly Fairies; they weren't born with this element, but they've been infected."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"We also know that the element can move through water."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich begins to rifle through his belongings and pulls out an odd-looking item.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Got it! Looks like it's still usable..."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich mumbles.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"These are the Water Purifiers I developed. They can be used underwater or on land. You can bury 'em in soil or float 'em on the river."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"%n%, can you do me one more favor? Place three purifiers upstream, midstream and downstream, and I'll track the energy flow."#npc$$821$1#|
11432|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Those Purifiers haven't been used in a while, but I'm sure they still work."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11433|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"How'd it go? Do they still float?"#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich asks eagerly.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Fenrich that you set up the Water Purifiers.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Excellent. Let me see if their locations show up on the Tracker." #npc$$821$1#|
11434|Fenrich plans to use Water Purifiers to remove the Halo Energy from the water. Thus, he requests that you place the three Water Purifiers in the river at strategic locations.

Place the Water Purifiers in three different areas along the river.|
11441|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I'm getting signals, but, um, there are only two. The Purifier closest to the Waterfall seems to have fallen off the face of the earth."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich's brow furrows.##npcs85h+70$$828$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Maybe it's malfunctioning. I never said this would be an easy task. Looks like I can only activate the other two Purifiers. As for the broken one..."#br##br#
#&53$Fenrich turns to you with a hopeful smile...##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I'm sure you wouldn't mind reactivating the purifier for me, would you? From what I can tell, the malfunctioning one is the Third Water Purifier downstream of the Waterfall."#npc$$821$1#|
11442|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I don't know how long those other two Purifiers will hold up. We're going to need to use them to their fullest extent if we hope to clean up this water."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11443|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Ah, back already! Was the device broken?"#npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Fenrich that you couldn't find the Third Water Purifier, but you'd discovered a passageway in back of the Waterfall.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"So there's a cave behind the Waterfall? Amazing! %n%, does it lead to the Secret Land you seek?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I bet the Third Water Purifier slipped through the passageway."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I've managed to get a few readings from the runaway Purifier, and I think the energy might be emanating from the Secret Land. The First and Second Water Purifiers aren't picking up much contamination."#npc$$821$1#|
11444|Fenrich loses the signal from one of the Purifiers and asks you to follow the river and find the malfunctioning Purifier.

Search for the Water Purifier near the Waterfall.|
11451|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Let's assume that the secret passageway in the back of the Waterfall is the origin of the Halo Energy. If that's the case, we have to keep creatures away from it."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"How are we supposed to get the Giant Woodbeasts to stay away? We've no way of communicating with the brutes."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"We'll have to drive the Giant Woodbeasts upstream, midstream, and downstream, or they'll be contaminated by the energy. Personally, I don't even want to confront a normal Giant Woodbeast, let alone an energy-infused, rage-filled one."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I'm not exactly capable of taking on the Woodbeasts. I'm a scholar, not a fighter! I'm depending on you to help me with this!"#npc$$821$1#|
11452|#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I don't think we have enough in that Detoxification Tank. We must take every precaution with this."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11453|#&7$Fenrich##br#
#&53$Fenrich looks up at you, prepared for your report.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Fenrich you've driven away the Giant Woodbeasts.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Now that we know the source of the contamination, we can look toward the next steps. %n%, to avoid further contamination, you'll need to seal the passageway to the Secret Land."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Nature's balance will restore itself slowly but surely. On behalf of all the living creatures in this forest, I thank you."#npc$$821$1#|

"I must discuss this with the Village Chief. We need to come up with a plan to block the passageway behind the Waterfall. But before any of that happens..."#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I think the ancient energy you and my brother seek is probably inside that cave."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"I know that this is extremely important to you, I'll let Augustus know, too. He's probably waiting with bated breath."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Fenrich##br#
"Let me tell him. Maybe it'll help us bond. Why don't you go explore the Secret Path? Augustus will catch up with you soon enough. Just... just promise me you'll look out for him."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod. If you can find the Ancient Energy within the cave, perhaps you can activate the Spirit Separator.##char$$821$0#|
11462|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Do you know how long I've waited for this? I've dreamed of this place for as long as I can remember!"#br#

11463|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Look at this section of the wall! The writing - it explains everything! It even includes the Halo Energy equation!" #npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"It seems like it's made up of some sort of code. I'm not going to stop until I get to the bottom of this!"#npc$$821$1#|

"This is incredible!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus is completely absorbed in the writing upon the stone wall.##npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You remind Augustus that this place, while it may be amazing, is still extremely dangerous. He has to watch himself lest he get attacked.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I know, I know... Woah, %n%! Do you see the writing on the wall? It...it's the Halo Energy equation!!"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus's expression is a mix of excitement and puzzlement.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"This place... It must be where our ancestors once lived. A place entirely forgotten by the world. It makes me feel...sad..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Long ago, our ancestors discovered Halo Energy. Because of this great source of power, Dwarves were quite a powerful force in the past... But we were overcome by greed and we lost it all..."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus reaches out to lay a hand delicately on the wall.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"They used Halo Energy to create gigantic robots, but they did not realize how unstable Halo Energy can be if not properly taken care of. All of their creations began to go completely out of control."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"The entire city was engulfed in flame as the Dwarves' great kingdom was destroyed overnight... Those who survived sealed the Halo Energy within the Secret Land."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Feeling sad for the loss of the Dwarven kingdom, you ask Augustus if it is unwise to bring Halo Energy out of the Secret Land.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"The Halo Energy itself is not the problem - it was actually the giant robots that contaminated it. The last robot is deep inside this ruin... Perhaps, if we destroy it, our ancestors' souls will be at rest."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%, do you think you could destroy it? Not only could it put our ancestors at ease, but it may also prevent the contamination from spreading. You don't need to worry about the Halo Energy itself anymore now that I have the correct formula."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"With the correct Halo Energy formula and my prototype equations, I will be able to complete the Halo Energy equation at last. I just need a bit more time..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I'm pretty certain I can rely on you to take care of the origin of the contaminant, right %n%? I'll be here concluding my study. Once I finish I'll simply use a Teleporter to transport myself back to the Competition Arena. I'll get your Spirit Separator up and running soon!"#npc$$827$1#|
11472|#&7$Augustus##br#
"I believe the words etched on the stone wall are encoded with a special Dwarven formula. From the looks of it, there was some sort of disagreement about how best to record the important information."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
11473|#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%, how'd it go?"#npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Augustus what happened deep within the Secret Land.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I hope the spirits of the ancestors can finally rest in peace."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus lowers his head solemnly.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Do you still remember the scroll from the East City Ruins, the one that contained a partly incomplete equation for Halo Energy? Looks like our ancestors were desperately trying to harness it."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"The scroll from the East City Ruins actually contains a modified equation."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I will combine the modified equation with the original equation from the Secret Land, and we should be able to use the Halo Energy to power the Spirit Separator. Now I just need to make a few final adjustments."#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$Augustus reinstalls the activation switch on the Spirit Separator, and it emits a strangely melodic screech.##npcs85h+70$$2011$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You and Augustus share a wide grin. After a good deal of trial and error, the Spirit Separator has finally been successfully activated.##char$$824:71$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I haven't forgotten our agreement. The Spirit Separator is yours now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"However, I should tell you that the energy is only strong enough for one use. You'll have to give it back to me after you use it so I can recharge it. Otherwise, you could encounter problems. However, I doubt you'll want to separate your spirit from your body very often."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"If you don't mind, please separate the spirit of that obnoxious young girl while you're at it. Otherwise, she'll be back here soon enough, making trouble. I just can't handle her whining much longer."#npc$$821$1#|
11482|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Halo Energy is truly a double-edged sword. With great power comes great responsibility; I must honor the ancestors by protecting the energy. Perhaps if I tweak the formula here, I can prevent others from abusing the power."#npcs85h+70$$828$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Why are you still here? Is there a problem with the machine?"#npc$$821$1#|
11483|#&7$Augustus##br#
"So you say you used the machine correctly, but the girl didn't react at all? You must've done it wrong. Here, give it to me, I'll use it on you."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
#&53$Augustus quickly charges up the Spirit Separator and works its magic on you...##npc$$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After being hit with a beam of radiance, you begin to float in midair, just as Caroline did. A strange feeling floods your senses.##char$$503$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It feels as though an external force is trying to dissolve your energy. You experience some mild pain, but it also feels as though a strong power within your body is battling the external force.##char$$503$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Soon, the effect dissipates completely. The energy inside you seems to win a victory over the external force.##char$$502$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Huh? What just happened?"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus exclaims as you fall to the ground with a thud.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Augustus what happened, brushing dirt from your clothes and catching your breath. You feel a nasty bump raising on your head.##char$$506$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"It doesn't work at all! I think the Separator overheated! Did it malfunction?"#br##br#
#&53$Augustus shakes his head, puzzled.##npc$$828$1#|
11484|Augustus has finished repairing the Ancient Machine you brought him. Now you can use it on Caroline, as you promised.

11485|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You follow Augustus's instructions to operate the Spirit Separator. After you press several buttons, a radiant beam of light projects onto Caroline.##char$$391$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
#&53$Caroline's body begins to float slowly.##npc$$503$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"What's that strange feeling?"#npc$$503$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
#&53$When the energy diminishes, Caroline drifts to the ground.##npc$$501$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Did it work?"#br##br#
#&53$Caroline asks, wide-eyed.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Caroline's Eidolon##br#
#&53$Caroline seems totally unchanged to you. Her Eidolon stands next to her, staring at you silently.##M610010$Caroline's Eidolon$1$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
#&53$As Caroline sees the Eidolon, her face falls.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Why is this pest still here?"#br##br#
#&53$Caroline points to her Eidolon angrily.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Caroline that you used the Spirit Separator on her, but it didn't seem to work.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"So it's hopeless, then? Is that it?"#br##br#
#&53$Caroline shouts, balling her hands into fists.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caroline##br#
"You don't want to help me at all! Just wait and see, one day I'll separate myself from my spirit, and I won't help you one bit!"#npc$$826$1#|
11491|#&7$Augustus##br#
"That's strange. The machine is running. Let me try."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus snatches a Grass Sprout from the Cloth Bag.##npcs85h+70$Augustus$821$1#

#&7$Grass Sprout##br#
#&53$The Grass Sprout struggles violently, desperately attempting to squirm away.##M021020s70h+85$Grass Sprout$101$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Don't be afraid, little Grass Sprout. It's just a flash. It won't hurt."#br##br#
#&53$Augustus smiles crookedly and flashes the Grass Sprout with the Spirit Separator. ##npcs85h+70$Augustus$821$1#

"Loo loo? Chee chee chee!"#br##br#
#&53$The Grass Sprout collapses, a strange expression frozen on its face.##M021020s70h+85$Grass Sprout$201$1#

"Hmm. Well, it seems like it works, but the Eidolon energy inside you and Caroline is stronger than we could have imagined."#npcs85h+70$Augustus$823$1#

#&53$It hasn't occurred to you that even with the Spirit Separator, you and your Eidolon would remain inseparable.##char$$809:80$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain what had happened in Cactakara Forest, including the fact that you managed to repair the Spirit Separator. However, its brilliant beam of light had no effect on you nor Caroline.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
#&53$After listening to your story, the Grand Bishop falls silent. He closes his eyes for a moment.##br##br#
"After all you have been through, do you still wish to separate yourself from the Eidolon?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are stunned by the question. Since the Eidolon appeared, you've been trying to get rid of it, however, you had been through a lot with your Eidolon. It has truly become your partner.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"You and your Eidolon are bound together by your relationship, and thus, the Spirit Separator cannot sever the Power of Gaia within you. I hope you cherish your unusual power; learn to embrace it and use it to better the world."#npc$$821$1#|
11494|The Spirit Separator did not work on you or Caroline. To find out why, Augustus suggests that you head for Navea to get a second opinion from different disciplines.

"The Shadow Knight has taken the Church Scholar, but that's not all. He also kidnapped the Town Mayor and one other resident of Tomitsa. We don't know what his agenda is, but we're gonna find out."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"There must be a connection between the hostages. %n%, I'd like you to get some information from the townsfolk. See if you can get some clues to determine where the Shadow Knight could've taken the kidnapped folks."#npc$$821$1#|

"Yes, but I will need your help. Although the lions outside of Tomitsa are vicious beasts, their meat is quite rich in nutrients. They're actually an excellent source of food - if they don't eat us first, that is."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Can you hunt some Cliff Lions and Bloodthirsty Lions and bring back their meat? We also need some spices grown at the Village Entrance; we can use them to pickle the meat and make it a little less, well, lion-y tasting."#npc$$821$1#|
11542|#&7$Victoria##br#
"These lions can be a handful. Use extreme caution. Oh, and don't forget to go to the Town Entrance to collect some spices."#npc$$821$1#|

"I'm Rebecca, a local travel guide. I was going to take my boss to visit Demarech Pool. On our way, I found this badly injured man on the side of the road."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You look over and see a familiar face - Luther, who had fought the pirates at your side in Helonia.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Is that you!? %n%?"#M103030$Luther$823$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"You two knew each other? Luther is my boss. We planned to see all the miracles in Demarech Mines, but then we saw this wounded man laying here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You immediately ask about Bobby's condition.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"Looks like the Scavenger Birds got him. I've never seen them attack a human, but they've become so terribly vicious lately..."#npc$$821$1#|
11561|#&7$Luther##br#
"Rebecca likely already told you that his wound is infected, and he's suffering from a very high fever. We need to deal with it immediately."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"The skin of the Leathery Angler Bug is elastic, and we could use it as a bandage to stop the bleeding. Hard-Shelled Angler Bugs are under constant attack from the Scavenger Birds, so their blood has developed an antibacterial effect to protect them from disease."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"These bugs squirm about in the south of Cliff Valley. If you can get the bugs, we may just be able to save Bobby here."#npc$$821$1#|
11562|#&7$Luther##br#
"His condition is critical. I don't know how much longer he can last. Quick, slaughter the bugs, and bring back their Skin and Fluids."#npc$$821$1#|
11563|#&7$Luther##br#
"Thank goodness. With these skins and body fluids, we can save this poor man's life."#npc$$821$1#|
11564|Luther wants you to obtain Skins and Fluids from the nearby Bugs so that he can treat Bobby's wounds.

Obtain the Skins from Leathery Angler Bug and Bug Fluids from the Hard-Shelled Angler Bugs.|
11571|#&7$Luther##br#
"Though we've administered first aid, he's not quite out of the woods yet. However, if you hadn't showed up just then, he'd certainly be dead by now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"When we found Bobby, he still hadn't completely lost consciousness. He kept saying that he lost a very important package. I wonder what could've been worth risking his life."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ponder Luther's words. You indicate that the package could be a clue Bobby discovered.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"He must have lost the package when he was attacked, Maybe those blasted Scavenger Birds took it. You might have some luck looking for it north of Pitmere Canyon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Watch out for those birds, though. One scratch from their claws, and you could be infected. If you don't exterminate them, they'll only transmit their diseases to other innocents."#npc$$821$1#|
11572|#&7$Luther##br#
"Quick, head for the north of Pitmere Canyon to locate the missing package. I have a feeling it might contain important information about what happened in the Mine."#npc$$828$1#|
11573|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You slide the package over to Luther.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"This must be the package Bobby lost. It must be important."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"How is the human? His breathing has improved,"#br##br#
#&53$%p% chirps. It's exactly what you want to know, too.##pet$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Bobby's much more stable now. His fever broke, thank goodness."#npc$$821$1#|
11574|Luther asks you to go to the Mine in the north to look for Bobby's Package and destroy all the Scavenger Birds.

Go to the northern part of Pitmere Canyon, and search for Bobby's Package. While you're at it, take out all the Raging Scavenger Birds and Infected Scavenger Birds.|
11581|#&7$Luther##br#
"Scavenger Birds follow the smell of blood, and they're trailing us. If we are under attack, we won't be able to retreat quickly enough if we're dragging behind an injured patient."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"%n%, the only way to deter the Scavenger Birds is to defeat their leader."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I used the Bug Skin you brought me to make a simple bait. Take this to the north of Pitmere Canyon. Lure out the Scavenger Bird King, and show it which species is boss."#npc$$827$1#|
11582|#&7$Luther##br#
"You must quickly use this bait to lure out the Scavenger Bird King, then slay it!"#npc$$821$1#|
11583|#&7$Luther##br#
"You really did it! My faith only wavered for maybe a second or two there! I bet those blasted Scavenger Birds will think twice before coming near us again."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"And as an added bonus, I found a map inside Bobby's Package!"#npc$$821$1#|
11584|Luther asks you to use bait to lure out the Scavenger Bird King, then slay it. With their leader dead, the other birds likely won't set foot (or claw) in the area gain.

Go to the northern region of the Cliffs, and use the bait to lure out the Scavenger Bird King. Defeat it.|
11591|#&7$Luther##br#
"Looks like it's a map of the Mining Area, there are a few newly drawn marks on it. I bet that's where the prisoners are being held."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"This is a huge breakthrough. You'd better go back to the town and report this to the person in charge before we do anything."#br##br#
#&53$Luther places the map in your hands.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and tell him you will take the map to Investigation Team Leader Victoria immediately. It might contain valuable clues that could help rescue the hostages.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Even though the information should be delivered as soon as possible, I still need your help with something equally important."#br##br#
#&53$Luther frowns, wringing his hands.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Did you see the Demarech Pool in the east? An army of Slimelings dwell in that area. We came this way to avoid the disgusting beasts."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I'm worried they're heading this way. Can you defeat them before you head back to town?"#npc$$821$1#|
11592|#&7$Victoria##br#
"Even worse, the Slimelings that appeared in the west seemed to come from nowhere. Things just keep getting worse. Don't bother me unless it's important."#npc$$821$1#|
11593|#&7$Victoria##br#
"Did you find the man who left town? I can't believe he just up and left - how selfish. Is he safe?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Victoria that you found Bobby, though he is wounded, and filled her in on everything else. You then hand her Bobby's map.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"He was risking his life... for his father's safety? I guess I misjudged him."#br##br#
#&53$Victoria smiles sadly, then unfolds the map.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"The location marked on this map is the northwest part of the Mine. This could be where they're holding the townspeople captive."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"He must have gone through a lot to get this information. I will send someone to search for them immediately. We've got to get them to safety."#npc$$821$1#|
11594|Luther asks you to take Bobby's map to the Team Leader. On your way back, he requests that you drive off nearby fearsome Slimelings, as the creatures threaten Luther and any other passersby.

Slay the Slimelings north of the ruins, and take Bobby's map to Victoria in Tomitsa.

11601|#&7$Victoria##br#
"The rescue operation is definitely the priority, but we're going to be short-handed, so we are going to need your help again."#br##br#
#&53$Victoria sighs.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"We've lost contact with our colleagues at the Caerment Altar. A bunch of Slimelings occupy the road to the altar. I think they came from Demarech Pool."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"I need you to get rid of the Demarech Slimelings along the road. Meet the Vice Leader at the Caerment Altar, and ask him how the interrogation is going."#npc$$1$1#|
11602|#&7$Floyd##br#
"A number of Demarech Slimelings suddenly appeared on the road in the south. If we don't get rid of them, we have no way of keeping in contact with the Team Leader."#npc$$821$1#|
11603|#&7$Floyd##br#
"Are you the contact person the Team Leader sent? I'm really busy now, so please don't disturb me if it's not important."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"I can hardly keep up with killing all these beastly creatures, and now I have to deal with a witch who won't cooperate and refuses to provide any information? Nuts to this!"#npc$$826$1#|
11604|Victoria asks you to go to the Caerment Altar to search for the team members with whom they had lost contact. She also wants you to get rid of the Demarech Slimelings blocking the road on your way to the altar. 

Go to the Caerment Altar, and meet with Vice Leader Floyd. Next, eliminate all the Demarech Slimelings north of Tomitsa.

11611|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A witch? Information? You ask Floyd what's going on.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"The witch is the only one who's looked the Shadow Knight in the eye and is alive to tell the tale."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"We think she's the Shadow Knight's accomplice. If she still won't talk, I'm going to have to torture it out of her."#br##br#
#&53$Floyd cracks his knuckles, a twisted smile playing on his face.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You could feel Floyd's hatred for the Shadow Knight pulsing in the air around him.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"Asking her nicely is a waste of time. If you want to waste your time, too, be my guest."#npc$$821$1#|
11612|#&7$Geno##br#
"Did you manage to get any information from the witch?"#npc$$821$1#|
11613|#&7$Geno##br#
"Were you sent to help us? I've heard others mention your name."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"You couldn't get her to spill her guts, could you? Vice Leader Floyd and I have questioned her a million times, but she won't say a word about that blasted Shadow Knight."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Geno that you couldn't get any information about the Shadow Knight, either.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"I apologize for the Vice Leader's temper. He's not normally so testy, but Miles, the kidnapped scholar, is an old friend of his. He cannot control his rage right now."#npc$$821$1#|
11614|The witch, Hazel, has interacted with the Shadow Knight before, but she refuses to divulge the nature of their interaction. Floyd asks you to pry any information from her about the Shadow Knight.

Interrogate Hazel about the Shadow Knight.|
11615|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You were just about to ask about the Shadow Knight, when the witch began to speak.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"Don't bother asking. I won't tell you anything about him."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"No matter what you say, I won't speak a word. Threaten my life if you must, but my lips are sealed,"#br##br#
#&53$The witch speaks calmly, though you can see her hands shaking ever so slightly.##npc$$821$1#|
11621|#&7$Geno##br#
"We heard that the Shadow Knight met Hazel long ago, and from that point on, strange things happened at the altar."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"Even though we'd like to investigate, the Altar's defense system has been activated. Those Boulder Guardians have stood in our way since the beginning."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You look around and spot numerous Boulder Guardians glaring back at you with stony eyes.##char$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, wanna give it a try? Might be fun to take out a beastie that big!"#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You consider %p%'s suggestion and decide you might as well give it a try.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"Are you sure? Well, go ahead; we don't have any better ideas. You eliminated all the Slimelings on your way to the altar, so you might just be capable of taking these creatures out, too."#npc$$821$1#|
11622|#&7$Geno##br#
"These Guardian Golems are running rampant. Please get rid of them."#npc$$821$1#|
11623|#&7$Geno##br#
"Even though you've destroyed a great many Guardian Golems, they just keep coming back. I think they're multiplying... or maybe coming back from the dead."#M121010$Geno$823$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"......."#M105010$Hazel$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You notice the witch looking at you oddly, as though she wants to say something.##char$$821$0#|
11624|Geno asks you to get rid of all the Guardian Golems near the altar so that he and the others can conduct their investigations without further interruptions.

Get rid of the Guardian Golems at Caerment Altar.|
11631|#&7$Hazel##br#
"It won't work. No matter how many times they are beaten, they'll still keep coming for you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"The key lies within the Keeper Golems. They are the progenitors of the Guardian Golems."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"You must get the core of a Keeper Golems, then shatter it. If you do that, they can no longer resurrect themselves. Give the Broken Core to me; only I can destroy it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You have no idea why Hazel suddenly offered to help, but since the Investigation Team can't solve the current problem, you have no choice but to give Hazel's theory a try.##char$$828:80$0#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"Is it odd that I'm helping you? I can't tell you anything about your foe, but that doesn't mean I'm your enemy, too. Besides, I'd like to verify something..."#npc$$821$1#|
11632|#&7$Hazel##br#
"If you don't destroy those Elemental Cores, the monsters will just keep resurrecting."#npc$$821$1#|
11633|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Hazel the Broken Cores.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hazel##br#
#&53$Hazel holds the Cores in her hand, but her eyes remain on you and %p%.##br##br#
"Just as I suspected..."#npc$$1001$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"So you really are an Envoy of Gaia."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"Haven't you noticed? The energy that drives these creatures is from Terra itself. If someone could manage to break such a powerful Core, well, it would have to be you, the Envoy of Gaia!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are surprised by Hazel's words. You didn't feel like you had any special powers, even when you had the Core in your hands.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"Since you are an Envoy of Gaia, well, I don't have to say a word. I have a better way to let you know what has happened here."#npc$$821$1#|
11634|Hazel reveals that the only way to destroy the Golems once and for all is to smash their cores.

Obtain the cores of the Keeper Golems, then destroy them.|
11641|#&7$Hazel##br#
"Even though I can't talk about that man, I won't be breaking my promise if you go see it for yourself."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
#&53$Hazel hands you a piece of paper with a spell written on it.##br##br#
"Since you're an Envoy of Gaia, just as he is, you can feel his power within you. Use this spell to view my memories."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You know Hazel is talking about the Shadow Knight, which makes you very nervous. However, you feel you have no choice but to take the paper.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"Cast this spell at the Caerment Altar, and you'll experience what happened here firsthand."#npc$$821$1#|
11642|#&7$Geno##br#
"How did it go? Do you know what the Shadow Knight did here?"#npc$$821$1#|
11643|#&7$Geno##br#
"You know what the Shadow Knight did here?! Quick, tell me what happened!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You describe everything you saw to Geno.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"I see. I never would have imagined you could view the memories remotely. If I'd known it'd be so easy, I wouldn't have wasted so much time."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"Both this adventurer and the Shadow Knight are Envoys of Gaia. That's why they can share memories. It's fate."#br##br#
#&53$Hazel's eyes turn misty.##M105010$Hazel$821$1#|
11644|Hazel can't talk about the Shadow Knight, but she can let you experience her memories yourself.

Use the Witch's Spell at the Caerment Altar, and experience the meeting between the witch and the Shadow Knight.|
11651|#&7$Geno##br#
"If I'm understanding you correctly, the Shadow Knight has already awakened the Cube of Gaia and used its powers to influence the creatures around the Mine. The Slimelings that emerged in the Demarech Pool likely also appeared because of the sinister energy."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"Hazel still wants to talk to you - but she'll only divulge information if you meet with her alone. I need to report to the Team Leader and Vice Leader, so I'll leave you for now."#npc$$821$1#|
11652|#&7$Rebecca##br#
"So we meet again. Can I help you with something?"#npc$$821$1#|
11653|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Rebecca about the strange events of the Demarech Pool.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"You've come to the right person. I'm the most experienced guide in this area. I'm very familiar with the terrain and history of the Mine."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rebecca##br#
"According to an ancient legend, the Demarech Pool is an energy hub. Legend has it an incredible power lies within."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After hearing Rebecca's explanation, you worry that perhaps the Shadow Knight stored the Cube of Gaia's energy inside the Demarech Pool and is using this power to influence the entire Mine.##char$$821$0#|
11654|After figuring out the Shadow Knight's intentions, Geno immediately reports back to the commanding officer. You decide to continue searching for the Shadow Knight.

After asking Hazel about the Shadow Knight's whereabouts, go to the southwest of the Pool, and look for Rebecca.|
11655|#&7$Hazel##br#
"If you want to continue investigating the Shadow Knight, you ought to start with the Demarech Pool. For his spell to have such far-reaching effects, he must've cast it from the Demarech Pool."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hazel##br#
"That's all I can say. You'll have to find out the rest yourself."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You immediately remember the person most familiar with Demarech Pool - Rebecca the Guide. Maybe she can help you. ##char$$821$0#|
11661|#&7$Luther##br#
"%n%, you want to investigate the Demarech Pool? You'll need my help."#npc$$821$1#

"I've been looking to repay your kindness since you helped me in Helonia."#npc$$1$1##&PP00602#

#&7$Luther##br#
"I'm not much of a fighter, but I can help you with the investigation. If you can lure the monsters away from the edges of the Demarech Pool, I can go inside and check out the situation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You furrow your brow, worried about Luther's safety. However, at the Pirates Camp on the Helonia Coast, Luther proved he was a brave, thorough scout. You reluctantly agree to his suggestion.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Just leave those Ruins Parasites to me and %n%."#pet$$821$1#|
11662|#&7$Luther##br#
"Insects have swarmed Demarech Pool. If you can lure them away, I can slip in and investigate."#npc$$821$1#|
11663|#&7$Luther##br#
"I've just entered Demarech Pool, but the place is teeming with monsters. An ethereal Ball of Light floats through the air."#M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"The monsters here are no joke. If we let them emerge from the Demarech Pool, they could put the lives of residents here in danger."#br##br#
#&53$Luther knits his brow, thinking.##M103030$Luther$821$1#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"Don't worry. I know what to do."#br##br#
#&53$Bobby's eyes flutter as he struggles to stand.##M003040h+50$Bobby$501$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"You're awake! Hey, easy, don't move too much. We don't want you to start bleeding all over the place again."#M103030$Luther$823$1#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"Don't worry about me. I have to tell you what my father told me. It's about the Shadow Knight..."#M003040$Bobby$501$0#|
11664|Luther decides to help you investigate the Demarech Pool, but you must first get rid of the fearsome insects patrolling its periphery. With them out of the way, he can enter the Pool easily.

Eliminate all the Ruins Parasites near the edges of the Demarech Pool.|
11671|#&7$Bobby##br#
"My father said all this madness was caused by the Shadow Knight inserting a powerful force into the Demarech Pool. The Ball of Light is made of energy."#M003040h+50$Bobby$501$1# 

#&7$%p%##br#
"The power comes from the Cube of Gaia. If the Demarech Pool is truly the center of all this, it can easily disseminate the power to the entire Mine."#pet$$821$0#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"If we destroy the Ball of Light, the creatures at the Mine will no longer be under its spell. However, we still have to get rid of the monsters wandering around here."#M003040$Bobby$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and hope Bobby can give you more details.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"Let's start with the Boulder Sentries. We have to use them to eliminate the Miracle Rock Monsters before we can destroy the Ball of Light. I'm getting ahead of myself. First, we must obtain the fragments of the core from the Boulder Sentry."#M003040$Bobby$501$1#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"After we gather all the fragments, we can move to the next step."#br##br#
#&53$Bobby gently touches his wound and winces in pain.##M003040$Bobby$501$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Hand me the Fragments that you've brought back. You're injured. Don't make things worse."#br##br#

11672|#&7$Luther##br#
"Have you already obtained the Shock Core? If not, we have no way of defeating the Miracle Rock Monsters."#npc$$821$1#|
11673|#&7$Luther##br#
"We now have enough Shock Core Fragments. I'll follow Bobby's instructions and assemble them into a complete Shock Core."#npc$$821$1#|
11674|To return the creatures in the Mine to their normal state, you must destroy the Balls of Light in the Demarech Pool. However, before you do that, you have to defeat the creatures that lurk near the edges of the pool.

Defeat the Boulder Sentry, and give the Shock Core to Luther.|
11681|#&7$Luther##br#
"Use the Shock Core I've assembled to deal with the Miracle Rock Monsters. The Rock Monsters are just like the Slimelings; they only appeared because of the magic permeating Demarech Pool."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"After you defeat the Miracle Rock Monsters, use the Shock Core to destroy them, or they'll resurrect themselves until the end of time."#npc$$821$1#|
11682|#&7$Luther##br#
"Remember to use the Shock Core to destroy the defeated Shrine Guardians, or they'll come back to haunt you."#npc$$821$1#|
11683|#&7$Luther##br#
"The Miracle Rock Monster population is finally shrinking. It appears our method is working. Now we just need to destroy the floating Balls of Light."#npc$$821$1#|
11684|The only way to stop the Miracle Rock Monsters from resurrecting is by finishing them off with a powerful shock!

"It's time for the final step. According to Bobby, as long as we destroy the floating Balls of Light, the energy pulsing in the air at Demarech Pool will dissipate naturally."#npc$$821$1#

"If that happens, the creatures in the mine will gradually return to normal... I hope."#npc$$821$1#|
11702|#&7$Luther##br#
"Quick, destroy all the Light Orbs around the Demarech Mines. It's the only way to set things right again."#npc$$821$1#|
11703|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After you destroy all the Light Orbs in the Demarech Pool, you tell Luther the good news.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Things will go back to normal soon, then, right?"#br##br#
#&53$Luther sighs with relief, but his hands shake a bit.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Rebecca just told me that more hideous Bugs are streaming in from the north. They're closing in on the Demarech Pool. Something must have happened in the north, I fear."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"That's... bad news..."#br##br#
#&53$Bobby manages to say, gasping through his pain.##M003040h+50$Bobby$501$1#|
11704|After you slay the monsters near the Demarech Pool, Luther asks you to destroy the Balls of Light floating near the area. Doing so will get rid of the monsters for good.

"I've seen those bugs in the north of the mining area before. Father and the others are imprisoned there, though I know you said the Investigation Team sent people to rescue them..."#M003040h+50$Bobby$501$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"What did I tell you?! Stop moving around; you'll pop all your stitches."#M103030$Luther$823$1#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"It's all right. I'm feeling much better now. I'm still worried about my father, though. The bugs... it's just not a good sign."#M003040h+50$Bobby$501$1#

#&7$Bobby##br#
"%n%, could you go to the mining area in the north to check on my father and the others?"#M003040$Bobby$501$1#

11713|#&7$Nate##br#
"You're just in time! We desperately need support. We'll also have to think of a way to get past the monsters on our way back so we can report our findings to Victoria."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You see Nate, the investigator, looking rather pallid. He bites his lip, trying hard to fight his emotions.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"The situation here is getting worse by the minute. If no one helps us, we'll never make it."#npc$$828$1#|
11714|Bobby asks you to go to the Camp near the mines to check on the situation with the reinforcements. While you're at it, he wants you to get rid of all the Rock Beetles near the mines.

11721|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You immediately ask Nate about the situation here and the conditions of the Shadow Knight's hostages.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"We followed Bobby's map and found the Shadow Knight's victims. But it was too late. The Shadow Knight ruthlessly slaughtered Scholar Miles."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Miles was an expert in ancient texts. You remember that when you were in Caerment Altar, in Witch Hazel's memory, the Shadow Knight had demanded that Miles awaken the Cube of Gaia.##char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$When he got what he wanted, he killed Miles. Though the Investigation Team did their best, you somehow know that slaying Miles was part of the Shadow Knight's plan all along.##char$$826:75$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Miles's assistant Maggie was also kidnapped. No one's heard from her since."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Even though the other townsfolk are not in immediate danger, they're rather weak from the ordeal. Please help me distribute this drinking water to them."#npc$$821$1#|
11722|#&7$Nate##br#
"Distribute the water quickly. The hostages are parched and dehydrated."#npc$$821$1#|
11723|#&7$Nate##br#
"I saw you inquiring about the current situation while you were handing out drinking water. I gotta say, you'll be a great investigator."#br##br#
#&53$Nate throws you a friendly smile.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Unfortunately, we still can't retreat. Look around, The Shadow Knight's crew is still lurking in every corner."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"When we were taking over the camp, a good number of his cronies fled instead of fighting. They must be hiding something."#npc$$821$1#|
11724|The rescued hostages are very weak right now. Nate asks you to bring them clean water.

Give Drinking Water to Town Mayor Mason and Old Man Harvey in Demarech Mines.|
11725|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You meet with Mason, Mayor of Tomitsa, and offer him some fresh Drinking Water. You've heard that he is the one who is most familiar with the mines.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Mason##br#
"So...you're the one the Church sent to help us, right?"#br##br#
#&53$Mason accepts the water while eyeing you up and down.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mason##br#
"Thank you for coming to help us. For what it's worth, I know you really did your best. I'm deeply sorry about Miles's death..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mason##br#
"In that regard, I hope all of you brave souls coming from the Church understand that it's not your fault. We don't blame you, no, not in the least. We all know whose fault it really is. That horrible man...the man you call the 'Shadow Knight'."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Even knowing that it's not your fault, you can't stop feeling a deep sadness in your heart. Uncertain of the full situation at Tomitsa you ask him what was going on exactly that lead to this.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Mason##br#
"This evil man, this... 'Shadow Knight,' forced me to study the mines, to find out where it leads to. Based on the formations of Miracle Stones, I discerned that the center of the mountain was the source of all of them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mason##br#
"At that central point, deep within the heart of the mountain, the miners discovered this...'Cube of Gaia.' I couldn't believe it...did they really discover the source of all creation? Could it be true?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You sense Mason getting quite emotional and hope he will continue with his story.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Mason##br#
"Threatening us all with death, the Shadow Knight coerced poor Miles to interpret the text inscribed upon the Cube of Gaia. Right when he finished, the cube began to shine with an eerie blue light..."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% looks at you sincerely and nods, confirming that it is indeed the Cube of Gaia out of legend.#br##br#
The cube that created the whole world...now in the hands of the Shadow Knight!##pet$$822$1#

#&7$Mason##br#
"He then snatched up the cube...killed Miles...and released us...most of us. Miles's young assistant was...taken."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You place your hand upon Mason's shoulder, knowing there's nothing you can do to help ease his pain. All you can do right now is be there for him - for Tomitsa.##char$$822:0$0#|
11726|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the drinking water to Harvey. Bobby's father, he's lived in Tomitsa Town for many years. It is still unknown to you why the Shadow Knight kidnapped Bobby.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"Thank you for saving my precious son and recovering the map that lead you to saving us as well. How is Bobby doing? Is he alright?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Harvey that Bobby is in stable condition, but someone is watching over him just in case.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
#&53$Hearing you say that Bobby is going to be fine, Harvey nods and a look of relief washes over him.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"That kid...he's always been getting into trouble even as a baby. Thank you for saving his life."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Compared to the others, Harvey is obviously very calm now. However, right at this moment, you have no questions to ask him.##char$$806:0$0#|
11731|#&7$Nate##br#
"While we were rescuing the hostages and fending off the Shadow Knight's henchmen, a few managed to escape carrying a large backpack."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"We have to find out what the Shadow Knight is collecting in there. It must be part of a grander scheme of his."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Please pursue those Porters who've managed to elude our grasp. Retrieve what they have taken - let's find out what the Shadow Knight is up to."#npc$$821$1#|
11732|#&7$Nate##br#
"Before they get any more distance on us, retrieve the backpack from those Porters. Whatever the Shadow Knight's plan is, we must put a swift end to it!" #npc$$821$1#|
11733|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand over the backpack that you took from the Marauder Porters. You're glad to be rid of it, as it was quite heavy to lug back on your own.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
#&53$Nate opens the backpack, finding that it is filled to the brim with...stones.##br##br#
"Stones? Wait...These are...Miracle Stones."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"This makes no sense! Yes, Miracle Stones are prime material for a well forged weapon, but...well, quite frankly, they're incredibly easy to get! What could the Shadow Knight be doing with so many Miracle Stones?!"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$From the merchants in the Navea, you know that the common use of Miracle Stones is a fact. Yet, for some reason, the Shadow Knight has been collecting stones on his own...##char$$1$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"So, he is collecting these stones for some reason...That does explain why his henchmen lingered in the mines, even after obtaining the cube."#npc$$821$1#|
11734|Some camp guards took things from the Shadow Knight's camp and ran away. Nate has asked you to hunt them down and retrieve those items.

11741|#&7$Nate##br#
"The mines are yet plagued with the minions of the Shadow Knight, even after his departure. Although we don't know his plans, they can't be good - his continued acquisition of the Miracle Stones must be stopped."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Our current best course of action is to get rid of the Shadow Knight's forces back in the mines. Can I entrust you with this task, %n%?"#npc$$821$1#|
11742|#&7$Nate##br#
"The Shadow Knight's minions are still collecting Miracle Stones from our mines. We have to stop them!"#npc$$821$1#|
11743|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You return to Nate and inform him that you have eliminated many of the Marauder Miners in the mines. The rest are still fleeing from the area.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"You've done us a great service, %n%. Now let's see if we can't discover the reason for the Shadow Knight's interest in these stones."#npc$$1$1#|
11744|The Shadow Knight's persistent interest in gathering Miracle Stones has Nate very concerned. He believes that the miners under the Shadow Knight's employ must be stopped quickly.

Eliminate the Marauder Miners from the Demarech Mines.|
11751|#&7$Nate##br#
"I believe that in this case, the best solution is the simplest solution. To save time, we should try to get the information directly from one of the Shadow Knight's miners."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"The Foreman in charge of the whole operation would certainly know something, don't you think, %n%? I think we should 'invite' him over for a chat."#br##br#
#&53$Nate smiles mysteriously.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Capture the Demarech Mines Foreman, tie him up, but don't kill him. We need to get all the information out of him that we can."#npc$$821$1#|
11752|#&7$Nate##br#
"Quickly now, %n%, capture the Foreman for us. We need to understand the Shadow Knight's plans as soon as possible."#npc$$821$1#|
11753|#&7$Foreman##br#
"Please, please don't hurt me! I'm just a supervisor! I'm simply paid to ensure the ores were delivered to the Marauder Camp in the east! I don't know anything else, I swear it!"#M102030$Foreman$823$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"A camp in the east, eh? Is that really all? Answer quickly and truthfully, your life depends on it, wretched cur."#M125021$Nate$826$1#

#&7$Foreman##br#
"That man, the one who hired me...he has an incredible power. He holds a strange cube, and when it glows...the stones come to life around him!"#M102030$Foreman$828$0#

#&7$Foreman##br#
"Those lifeless stones become completely under his control. If anyone were to resist, they could be pummeled in an instant by the lot of them. Who would dare defy his might?#M102030$Foreman$827$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
#&53$Nate turns to look at you.##br##br#
"%n%, what do you think?"#M125020$Nate$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$From what you've seen of the Foreman's reaction, you tell Nate that you believe he is telling the truth as he knows it. However, you're still not sure about the significance of the moving stones. Using golems to threaten people isn't new.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Sigh...You're right, he's clearly simply paid to follow orders and make deliveries. I'm afraid all the secrets must be hidden within this eastern camp."#M125020$Nate$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"What the Foreman says, however vague, worries me deeply. If what he says is true, the Shadow Knight has already learned how to create...life. This cannot be!"#M125020$Nate$821$1#|
11754|In an attempt to quickly learn all the information, Nate asked you to capture the Demarech Mines Foreman working under the Shadow Knight.

Capture the Demarech Mines Foreman for questioning.|
11761|#&7$Nate##br#
"All we know for sure about Miracle Stones is how desirable they are for weaponsmithing. But what is it that makes them so special?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
#&53$Nate rifles through the backpack you recovered from the Porters. Unfortunately, the examination offers no answers.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"The Gaia Cube is a source of incredible power. Perhaps its discovery has changed the world as we know it?"#br##br#
#&53$%p% speaks up suddenly.##pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Weapons forged from Miracle Stones have the power to awaken a human's potential. Maybe %p% is right,  and the Gaia Cube has somehow influenced the Miracle Stones themselves.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"That very well could be... I'm going to need some recently mined Miracle Stones to test this. We will ask the Town Mayor to take a look at our samples as he's an expert on ore. Maybe this will give us the clues we need." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"Here, take this shovel to the mines and bring back some freshly uncovered Miracle Stones. While you're in the area, why not also do a quick patrol - see if there's anything unusual still taking place." #npc$$821$1#|
11762|#&7$Nate##br#
"Retrieve a fresh sample of Miracle Stones for our examination and, while you're at it, do a quick patrol to find out if anything strange is afoot"#npc$$821$1#|
11763|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the samples to Nate and tell him about the Rock Beetles that look very similar to the surrounding stones. They are just like the ones that you've seen near the Demarech Pool as well.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You suggest that it's likely that the Rock Beetles are creatures brought to life by the Shadow Knight through his use of the Gaia Cube. Obviously, his creatures are starting to spread and not only appear in the mines.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"I can hardly believe it! The Shadow Knight's truly learned how to create life from nothing!"#br##br#
#&53$Nate grits his teeth and looks more concerned than ever.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
#&53$Nate calls out to get the mayor's attention.##br##br#
"Mayor Mason, can I please have a word with you? It's about the Miracle Stones. Tell me, do you sense something strange about them?"#npc$$821$1#|
11764|Nate believes that with some recent Mirale Stone samples, the Town Mayor will be able to discern if anything strange is going on with them.

Patrol along the east and west ends of the Demarech Mines and bring back some samples of Miracle Stone.|
11771|#&7$Mason##br#
"Is this a sample of freshly mined ore?"#br##br#
#&53$Mason picks up a sample of Miracle Stone and a look of shock spreads across his face.##M110030$Mason$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"What is it? Is there something wrong?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mason##br#
"We all know that the Miracle Stone is so precious because of the strength it seems to give weapons..."#M110030$Mason$821$0# 

#&7$Mason##br#
"Well, that strength...it is greatly amplified now. It's far too powerful for us to control."#M110030$Mason$823$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You realize that the Miracle Stones gained their mystic properties from the hidden Cube of Gaia. Now that the Shadow Knight has uncovered the Cube, its full power was unleashed upon the mines greatly impacting the entire area with its power.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"So these Rock Beetles truly are a new creation brought on by the Gaia Cube. We can't allow them to spread further than they already are - they'll endanger entire towns!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"%n%, you must get rid of as many Rock Beetles as you can. We must stop them before it gets out of hand."#npc$$821$1#|
11772|#&7$Nate##br#
"If we don't get rid of the Rock Beetles now, who knows how far they will spread? What havoc they will bring?"#npc$$821$1#|
11773|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Nate that you will start from the outside in - killing off the Rock Beetles that had already strayed from the mines and then heading to the source. You then take a moment to ask him about what he plans to do next.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"For the moment, I will relax, but I already have plans underway..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"My partner, Hamilton, is already investigating the Marauder Camp in the east. We also hope to locate Maggie; hopefully she is still alive. If all goes well, we will soon uncover the Shadow Knight's plans, as long as we..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
#&53$Harvey guffaws suddenly, interrupting Nate.##br##br#
"Is the Shadow Knight's plan not already blatantly obvious?"#M116010$Harvey$821$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
#&53$Nate narrows his eyes at Harvey.##br##br#
"Explain yourself, sir."#npc$$823$1#|
11774|The Rock Beetles, a creation of the Shadow Knight's use of the Gaia Cube, have become extremely dangerous. Nate asks you to eliminate these bugs and prevent them from spreading to other towns.

11781|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Harvey what he meant by that. Does he really already know the Shadow Knights intentions?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
#&53$Slowly, with a strange smile on his face, Harvey speaks.##br##br#
"The lode being mined in the western side of the mine is only the edge of the deposit. The eastern lode is what the Shadow Knight really wants, as it contains something of even greater power: The Miracle Crystals."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"These crystals are for making even more powerful weapons that can only be wielded by an Envoy of Gaia. The Shadow Knight's goal must be to obtain these."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"H-how do you know all this?!" #br##br#
#&53$Nate, on alert due to Harvey's sudden strange behavior, looks very uneasy.##M125021$Nate$1001$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"What, an old man like me can't know things like this?! Oh, I see, perhaps you think I'm in cahoots with the Shadow Knight, eh?" #br##br#
#&53$Harvey's strange smile leaves you unsure of what to think on the matter...##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"Tell you what, I was attacked recently by a Stoneskin Lion outside the Marauder Camp in the east. In my rush to escape, I lost my tools. Get my tools back for me, and I'll tell you more. Deal?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
#&53$Nate looks at you with a nod, indicating you should do as Harvey requests. Meanwhile, his hand rests quietly on his weapon as he stares down Harvey.##M125021$Nate$1001$0#|
11782|#&7$Nate##br#
"I'm not so sure about this... %n%, have you found the tools Harvey spoke of? Hurry and do so, I want to get a good look at what we're dealing with."#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$Nate takes the toolkit from you, never taking his eyes off of Harvey.##npc$$821$1#

#&53$With tools in hand, he quickly inspects them and his eyes widen in surprise.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"You! I can't believe you've been hiding in plain sight all these years!"#br##br#
#&53$Nate stands up suddenly and points accusingly at Harvey while handing you the toolkit.##br##br#
"Look, %n%, the markings!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You recognize the mark from Templar equipment, but you don't know why it's important here. You look back and forth between Nate and Harvey, waiting for someone to say something.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
#&53$Harvey simply smiles and says nothing.##M116010$Harvey$2$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"%n%, it's the mark of the Templars! This old man here was the last Knight Blacksmith for the Church!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nate##br#
"He was Analisa's teacher. His great skills as a smith are why the church created the title of Knight Blacksmith. Then one day, he suddenly retired, and disappeared..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"Alright, alright. Enough with the ancient history lesson! I just needed a change of scenery, you know? And some gosh darned privacy! I trained Analisa well, I knew she could handle the job at least as well as I did."#M116010$Harvey$825$0#

#&7$Nate##br#
"I can hardly believe it... The Knight Blacksmith! Without a doubt, all that Harvey says is true. We must inform Hamilton immediately."#npc$$826$1#|
11784|In order to gain Nate's trust, Harvey asks you to retrieve the toolkit he lost while he was investigating the Camp.

"He'll also need to be updated on all the information we've just learned here. I'll be staying here to protect Harvey."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod in agreement. The town mayor was kidnapped to locate the Cube of Gaia, and Miles was kidnapped to unseal it. Only Harvey was able to escape the Shadow Knight's Grasp before being used.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Clearly the Shadow Knight knows Harvey's true identity and intended to have him forge weapons from the Miracle Crystals obtained from the Demarech Mines. Nate is right to stay behind and keep him under guard.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"Here, hand this letter to Hamilton when you arrive, it'll explain a lot to him."#npc$$821$1#|
11802|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"The letter you mentioned, where is it?"#npc$$821$1#|
11803|#&7$Hamilton##br#
#&53$Hamilton opens the letter and reads it, his eyes widening in surprise at its contents.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"This letter...Is it really from the old man back in town? I can't believe it! The Knight Blacksmith was among us this entire time?!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"This is a highly irregular request, and I doubt the Church will agree...But it isn't my decision to make; we'll have to wait and see."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Confused, you ask Hamilton what the letter is about.##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Harvey believes that it is the best course of action to forge a weapon for you out of Miracle Crystals. The Shadow Knight will soon get his hands on them, so he believes we should prepare for this as best we can."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Surprised, you ask Hamilton if he has any more details about Miracle Crystal forged weapons. You had no idea Harvey would make such a suggestion.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"I can't tell you much until the Church sends its final decision. Until then, it won't hurt if I start preparing the materials now. Harvey must really trust you, %n%. He wouldn't do this for just anybody."#npc$$821$1#|
11804|Harvey has some plans, therefore he asks you to give a letter to Hamilton.

Give Harvey's letter to Hamilton who's outside Marauder Camp.|
11811|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"The Shadow Knight's Miners have their own hidden entrance to the Demarech Mines. However, without a map, we will certainly be lost in the winding paths of the mines. We have to be fully prepared before undertaking this investigation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"The Miners in this camp most certainly posses a map of the correct roads to take. We need to procure a copy of this map so that we can safely travel through the mines." #npc$$821$1#|
11812|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"If you defeat enough Miners around the camp, you'll eventually find the Mine Road Map we need."#npc$$821$1#|
11813|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Mine Road Maps you found to Hamilton.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Excellent, although they all seem to carry a different section of the map...Give me some time to put this together and determine the best path to take."#npc$$821$1#|
11814|Without a map, you will certainly quickly find yourself lost within the Shadow Knight's entrance to the mines.

Obtain Mine Road Maps from the Camp Miners.|
11821|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"These maps are more complicated than I thought, the Mine Roads are quite a maze. I'll be needing a bit more time to completely assemble the map." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"While I'm working on this, make yourself useful, and do something disruptive to their work!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"They often just leave their mining tools laying around the camp. You should destroy as many as you can - that'll slow them down for sure." #npc$$821$1#|
11822|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"We have to work fast or risk being discovered. Do your best to destroy as many tools as you can, while I work on assembling the rest of the map."#npc$$821$1#|
11823|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Good news, %n%! I've finally put together the Mine Road Map. Now we can proceed with our plan."#npc$$821$1#|
11824|In order to slow down the Shadow Knight's mining forays, Hamilton suggests that you destroy as many mining tools as you can.

Do what you can to destroy the Toolkits found in the Marauder Camp.|
11831|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"There's one more thing that I'd like us to accomplish before entering the mines. It's a special request from Harvey, actually."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"He needs you to get your hands on a few Stoneskin Lion Scales. I know it won't be easy, as you'll be dealing with the local Tamed Lions as well as their Tamers, but we should do it for Harvey's sake."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% speaks up, confused.##br##br#
"What's the point of these scales? We can quickly accomplish our task if we just sneak by these Lions and their Tamers..."#pet$$821$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"The scales' powder is often used by blacksmiths to increase the temperature of their forge. Harvey must be making preparations for his 'Miracle Weapon' already."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"If we can manage to get our hands on a Miracle Crystal, we'll have to be ready to use it as soon as possible. If not, the Shadow Knight will definitely try to get it back swiftly."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"We need to be prepared for anything, %n%. Get those scales now!"#npc$$821$1#|
11832|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Try to get these Stoneskin Lion scales as soon as possible, we need to hurry! Don't forget to watch out for the Tamers as well as their Lions, they're a double threat."#npc$$821$1#|
11833|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the scales to Hamilton who is looking around nervously.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Finally, you're back! Dash it all, they've just found the Miracle Crystal!"#npc$$826$1#|
11834|Harvey needs scales from a Stoneskin Lion in order to properly forge a Miracle Weapon.

Defeat Tamed Lions and their Tamers in order to obtain Stoneskin Lion Scales for Harvey.|
11841|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"I overheard the excited chatter from some nearby miners; they've just found the Miracle Crystal!"#npc$$821$1##&PP00603#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"We need to let everyone back in town know that the crystal has been found, but we must also prevent the crystal from being delivered to the Shadow Knight. It should currently be in the hands of the Marauder Captain, Solomon. It must be intercepted."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"%n%, I trust you'll be able to wrest the Miracle Crystal from the grasp of Solomon and his Assassins. As for me, I'll head back to town and report on our findings."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Nodding, you know that it would be disastrous if the Miracle Crystal were to fall into the evil hands of the Shadow Knight.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Here, %n%, take this Teleportation Device with you. After defeating Solomon and taking the crystal, you'll certainly be swarmed by foes. This will bring you back to my location immediately - don't lose it!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"So! Defeat Solomon, snatch the Miracle Crystal, and teleport back here. I know you may want to fight them all, and I don't doubt your ability, but we need to work quickly. Good luck out there!" #npc$$821$1#|
11842|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"You're still here?! Get out there and get the Miracle Crystal from Solomon! Hurry, before it's too late!"#npc$$821$1#|
11843|#&7$Hamilton##br#
#&53$Hamilton looks like he rushed to meet you here, he's panting quite heavily.##br##br#
"Did...did you do it? Did you get the Miracle Crystal?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod your head and hand over the Miracle Crystal.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Did you see Floyd on your way here? He was supposed to rush here as soon as he heard the news."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Hamilton that you have not seen Floyd anywhere, at least not while you were battling Solomon.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Where could he be? I haven't seen him anywhere. I told him directly that the rendezvous point is here..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Perhaps he has already entered the Mine?"#br##br#
#&53$After %p% says this, Hamilton looks even more worried than before.##pet$$821$1#|
11844|Hamilton discovered that the Shadow Knight's miners have located the Miracle Crystal and asks you to procure it no matter the cost.

Defeat Marauder Captain Solomon and his Marauder Assassins and snatch the Miracle Crystal from the evil minions of the Shadow Knight. Once you have done this, use the Teleportation Device to return to Hamilton - don't stay and try to fight!|
11851|#&7$Hamilton##br#
"I fear that %p% is right. The plan was to rendezvous here and await reinforcements from the Church, but I'm afraid Floyd has already entered the Mine... alone...."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"Even if he did have a map, which he doesn't, his eagerness to rescue Maggie will blind his logic. He'll be walking right into a trap!"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"It'll be a while yet before the Church's army arrives, and I'm not sure if Floyd can handle himself alone."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You offer the only possibility: You will enter the Mine in search of Floyd while Hamilton seeks out reinforcements.##char$$809$0#

#&7$Hamilton##br#
"I'm afraid you're right, this is the only solution. Do your best to find Floyd before it's too late! I'll deliver the Miracle Crystal to Harvey and then lead the reinforcements to your aid."#npc$$821$1#|
11852|#&7$Floyd##br#
"..." #npc$$821$1#|
11853|#&7$Floyd##br#
"Thank goodness, did Hamilton send you? I seem to have gotten myself into quite a predicament here..."#br##br#
#&53$Floyd keeps his hand pressed upon a grievous wound on his body, wincing in pain.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"The unspeakable has happened. Maggie...she...She's on the Shadow Knight's side!"#npc$$826$1#|
11854|Hamilton suspects that Vice Leader Floyd has already entered the Mine in search of Maggie, and suggests that you go save him.

Enter the Miner's Steppe (Instance) and find Investigation Team Vice Leader Floyd.|
11861|#&7$Floyd##br#
"I found Maggie near the entrance and approached her, hoping to guide her back outside. I never expected her to...to attack me so viciously..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"Maggie was always so loyal to the Church, and Miles trusted her completely. I can hardly believe she's working with the Shadow Knight..."#br##br#
#&53$Floyd frowns and continues to apply pressure to his wound.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"Don't worry about me, I can manage. You've more important things to do, I believe."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Floyd##br#
"If you keep going down the tunnel, you'll come across Maggie. I hate to say it, but try to subdue her the best you can. Maybe you can get her to explain why she is working alongside the Shadow Knight." #npc$$821$1#|
11862|#&7$Victoria##br#
"..." #npc$$821$1#|
11863|#&7$Victoria##br#
"Maggie, oh, dear Maggie. Miles was so kind to you... We all were... What happened?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maggie##br#
#&53$Maggie smiles cruelly.##br##br#
"Oh, really? You speak of kindness? No one has given me more kindness than him - My. Lord. Shadow. Knight!"#M106010$Maggie$827$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
#&53$Victoria frowns, obviously put off by Maggie's words. She turns and looks at you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"We'll bring Maggie back to the Church and interrogate her. Thank you so much for your help, even though the outcome is... Less than ideal. Because of you, we'll be able to put this matter to rest."#npc$$821$1#|
11864|Floyd has told you that Maggie is in fact working alongside the Shadow Knight and has attacked him. He requests that you subdue her for questioning.

Capture Maggie, who is somewhere inside the Miner's Steppe (Instance).|
11871|#&7$Victoria##br#
"Oh! I almost forgot, I have a message for you. Harvey has something he'd like to ask you the next time you see him."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Victoria if she knows what it's all about.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"He has an update for you about the Miracle Crystal. It seems that the Church has actually given the go-ahead for him to make you a weapon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
#&53$Victoria smiles.##br##br#
"I really envy you, %n%. Knight Blacksmith Harvey building weapon for you...using Miracle Crystal! It's the stuff of dreams for us all, isn't it? Well, good luck out there!"#npc$$821$1#|
11872|#&7$Harvey##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
11873|#&7$Harvey##br#
"You're back! You did it, %n%, I couldn't be prouder that you've successfully thwarted the Shadow Knight!"#br##br#
#&53$Harvey pats your shoulder in appreciation.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Harvey to explain more about the power of the Miracle Crystal.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"The Miracle Crystal draws a lot of energy from the Cube of Gaia, you see. It also has a similar effect when wielded as a weapon by an Envoy of Gaia. It should greatly enhance an Envoys power, which is why the Shadow Knight wants one so badly."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"You do know that he is also an Envoy of Gaia, right? Fallen from grace, unfortunately...If he got his hand on a weapon forged of the crystal, no one would be able to stop him."#npc$$821$1#|
11874|After Maggie is placed into custody, Victoria asks you to go back and have a talk with Harvey. 

Find Harvey and find out what he wants to discuss.|
11881|#&7$Harvey##br#
"Well, there's no time like the present, %n%. Can you hand me the things inside that box over there?"#npc$$821$1#|
11882|#&7$Harvey##br#
"What? Oh, don't worry, there's nothing dangerous in there, I could just use your assistance."#npc$$821$1#|
11883|#&7$Harvey##br#
"I've forged the Miracle Crystal into the first weapon that I have made since retiring. It's all yours now, %n%."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"With great power comes great responsibility. Be sure to use this weapon only for good. It'll bring horrible destruction if used for evil..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"I believe in you, though. I know in my heart that you'll do the right thing!"#npc$$821$1#|
11884|Harvey asked you to open the box next to him and hand him what's inside.

Open the Inconspicuous Box next to Harvey and take out the Miracle Weapon.|
11891|#&7$Harvey##br#
"It's true that we've managed to stop the Shadow Knight from getting his hands on the Miracle Crystal, but he is a powerful foe even without that great power. What's more, he has the Gaia Cube and an incredible amount of Miracle Stones to control."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Harvey what he knows about the full power of the Cube of Gaia.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"The true power of the Gaia Cube is yet unknown, but we do know that the entirety of the world was created by it."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"It has long been suspected that the Envoys of Gaia derive their power from the remnants of the cube. If this is true, given how powerful each Envoy is, the undistilled power of the Cube must be immense."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Harvey##br#
"I think it's time for you to journey back to Navea and meet with the Grand Bishop. Seek his advice - certainly the Shadow Knight will make his next move very soon."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$After meeting with the Grand Bishop, you will be presented with even tougher challenges. Please upgrade your skills to prepare for the adventure ahead. Training from Mirabelle's Bulletin Board or Miner's Steppe is recommended.#|
11892|#&7$Belenus##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1$1#|
11893|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the story of all that has transpired at Demarech Mines to the Grand Bishop as he listens intently.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You conclude, sadly, that you could not save everyone...Miles was killed, and Maggie corrupted by the Shadow Knight. You apologize, even though you tried your utmost.##char$$828:75$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Your story fills in the gaps of what the Templars have reported, I thank you. We are all filled with grief that we failed to save Miles..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"However, %n%, you did all that was possible, we all know this. Regaining control of the Mine was, at the very least, a success."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Harvey was right, however...The Shadow Knight has indeed already begun to set his next plans in action. As you were concluding investigations at Demarech Mines, he began to spread his influence to other lands: Both the Triatio Highlands and Candeo Marsh have fallen under his shadow."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Still concerned about the Witch, Hazel, saying that both you and the Shadow Knight are Envoys of Gaia, you confess to the Grand Bishop your hopes and concerns, as well as the fact that you're sure you've seen the Shadow Knight in your dreams...##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
#&53$Grand Bishop Belenus listens attentively, nodding and taking all you say into consideration, yet he remains silent.##npc$$828$1#|
11894|You prevented the Shadow Knight from getting his hands on the Miracle Crystal, but he did manage to get the Cube of Gaia and many Miracle Stones. Harvey asks you to go see the Grand Bishop and get information about the current situation.

Go to Navea and meet with the Grand Bishop.|
11901|#&7$Robinson##br#
"Battle is our one true calling, and protection of the people is our responsibility! How come you don't want to join forces?! Are we not good enough for you or somethin'?!"#M125010$Robinson$826$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"I keep telling you, my people are familiar with the terrain and are skilled in guerilla tactics. Your subordinates only understand standard battles and won't coordinate with us at all!"#M111030$Dallan$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You clear your throat loudly. Robinson turns and is slightly surprised to see you standing there.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Oh, uh, as you can see, I'm busy trying to make some sense out of this guy. I just can't figure out how his mind works."#M125010$Robinson$828$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"If you want to know what's goin' on around here, you may as well investigate it on your own for now. I gotta get through to this guy here first."#M125010$Robinson$821$1#|
11902|#&7$Kara##br#
"At this rate, I don't know how much longer we'll survive..."#npc$$828$1#|
11903|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You were just about to ask that old lady about the current situation of the Hunters' Mountain Village, but it seems she's so concerned about the Village that you didn't even have to ask.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Oh, are you a traveler? I'm sorry, but we won't be able to sell you any food here. We can hardly afford to feed ourselves lately..."#npc$$821$1#|
11904|Squad Leader Robinson is trying to persuade the Village Chief to team up in battle. Both forces have vastly different ideas on combat styles, so it looks like their argument will not end soon. You might as well explore the village and see if you can find out anything on your own.

Take a walk around Hunters' Mountain Village and find out what people are worried about lately.|
11905|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You try asking the local women of the village about the current situation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Village Woman##br#
"It's common knowledge that the Giants are incredibly tough! We're lucky to have the Jones family taking the lead against them in battle, mhmm!"#M006050$Village Woman$821$1#

#&7$Village Woman##br#
"Absolutely! With them around, even I feel safe letting my son go off to do battle alongside them! Maybe he'll even learn a thing or two about responsibility."#M008020$Village Woman$821$0#|
11906|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are about to ask some local hunters about the current news, when you overhear them talking about the Church.##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Village Hunter##br#
"This is an outrage! The Church won't even send us a single Templar?!"#M111010$Village Hunter$821$1#

#&7$Village Hunter##br#
"They sent a Squad Leader. A single Squad Leader! Do we really mean so little to the Church?!"#M111010$Village Hunter$827$1#

#&7$Young Hunter##br#
"You're right, how dare they? Do they think it's easy, defending our village from those huge Giants?"#M122010$Young Hunter$826$0#

#&7$Village Youth##br#
"Maybe the Templars just haven't shown up yet? I really hope they're on the way..."#M003030$Village Youth$823$1#|
11911|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You approach the older lady and tell her that you would like to really understand their situation and help out if you can manage.##char$$821$0##&PP00701#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Oh, my dear, you've only just arrived here, haven't you? I'll try to explain to you what our problem is. Once again, we are having a disagreement with the Giants over who gets to use certain hunting grounds. Unfortunately, we couldn't reach a civil agreement and are now at war. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Naturally, all the hunters want to fight and defend our hunting grounds. However, now no one is hunting for food! We're having a severe shortage now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Seeing Kara so upset, you ask if there's any way you can help out with food collection.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kara##br#
"It would be nice if you could help, but you look so weak and skinny..."#br##br#
#&53$Kara looks you up and down, trying to discern your ability from your looks alone.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Well, if you really want to help, maybe you can hunt down some Toucants and bring back some fresh meat? They're right outside the village, but don't strain yourself - the last thing we need is someone else to care for!"#npc$$821$1#|
11912|#&7$Kara##br#
"Keep in mind that you don't need to push yourself too hard out there. It's nice that you want to help, but we can't afford to feed you if you get injured!"#npc$$828$1#|
11913|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You deliver a few pounds of Toucant Meat to Kara and ask what else you can do to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Wow! How did you get so much Toucant Meat? What, all by yourself? Maybe you're not so weak after all!"#br##br#
#&53$Kara looks quite surprised, but extremely happy to see all that Toucant Meat.##npc$$823$1#|
11914|All the hunters are too busy with the war against the Giants to hunt for food, so Kara has asked you to help out with gathering meat.

Hunt Toucants and Hooked Toucants right outside the Village, and bring their Toucant Meat back to feed the Village.|
11921|#&7$Kara##br#
"I can hardly believe it - you're an excellent hunter! As good as any of us out here, that's for sure. Maybe I really am getting old if I can't accurately size up one of you young'uns anymore."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"I could certainly use your continued help, if you're willing."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Even though Kara's words say she believes you, you still get a feeling that you're being tested.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Kara##br#
"I've been putting it off for far too long, so I want to try this while I'm still alive and kickin'. I'd really like to try my hand at raising Toucants on my own, so we can sustain ourselves in times of trouble - our current situation being a prime example!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Do you think you can manage to bring back some Toucant eggs as well as a live Toucant mother to hatch them?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"This would really mean a lot to not only me, but the entire village."#npc$$822$1#|
11922|#&7$Kara##br#
"It's not easy to catch a Toucant alive, I can tell you that much! Ahh, hehehe, that reminds me of that one time..."#br##br#
#&53$Kara seems to remember a distant memory and trails off, gazing off into the distance.##npc$$821$1#|
11923|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You carefully hand over some warm Toucant Eggs to Kara as well as one live and kicking Toucant mother. Kara's eyes light up in delight and the years seem to fade away from her.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Kara##br#
"At last, my very own Toucants! You're quite gifted, you know? Gentle yet cunning - you'll make a remarkable hunter."#npc$$821$1#|
11924|Kara has always wanted to try her hand at rearing a flock of Toucants. Since you're being so helpful, she thinks you're the perfect candidate to help her achieve her dreams.

Collect Toucant Eggs and then use the Capturing Tool to capture a live Hooked Toucant for Kara.|
11931|#&7$Kara##br#
"Thanks to your kindness and skill, I no longer have to fret about our food supplies. Let's relax a while and have a chat, %n%.#br##br#
#&53$Kara smiles contentedly and looks completely relaxed for the first time.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Tell me, what brought you all the way to this small village of hunters? It's not exactly a suitable place for a young person such as yourself to move up in the world."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Kara about what happened to the Demarech Mines with the Shadow Knight. When you reveal that the Church has asked for your help in the pursuit of the Shadow Knight, her eyebrows raise.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Wow, so you're not just some ordinary youngster are you? An Envoy of Gaia! As I live and breathe!"#br##br#
#&53$Kara looks at you in awe - all your achievements are quite impressive to her.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"I would love to help out...and I think I have an idea as to how."#br##br#
#&53$Kara takes off the pendant around her neck and hands it to you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Here, take this pendant to my son, Dallan, and tell him that I want to help you investigate. He'll know what to do."#npc$$826$1#|
11932|#&7$Robinson##br#
"Argh, Dallan is so stubborn, it's infuriating! Can't he understand that this'll be easier with a larger force?"#br#
#&53$Robinson paces back and forth, unable to accept his situation.##npc$$821$1#|
11933|#&7$Robinson##br#
"Have you heard what Dallan said? He still won't join forces with my soldiers!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"I will not fail my assignment, so I will guard this village no matter what. I'd rather help the villagers out in their battle with the Giants, but if they won't let me..."#br##br#
#&53$Robinson is looking increasingly frustrated with his situation.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You pat Robinson on the shoulder and tell him that you may have another source of information about the Shadow Knight.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Oh? I see...Well, you better go and talk to Dallan, then. We'll continue to guard the village here, I guess...#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"I certainly won't sit around idly, even if Dallan doesn't want our help. I won't interfere until he changes his mind - if he changes his mind, but that won't stop me from gathering intel on these Giants from any sources I can manage."#npc$$827$1#|
11934|You told Kara the story of the Shadow Knight and the Demarech Mines and she can hardly believe all the things you have accomplished as such a young person. As repayment for your help, she hands you her pendant and tells you to take it to her son, Dallan. Apparently, he'll know what to do from there.

After a quick meeting with Robinson, take Kara's Pendant to Village Chief Dallan.|
11935|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You approach Dallan and hand him Kara's Pendant, unsure of what to expect next.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"How did you get this? My mother just gave it to you? How odd...This is our most treasured family heirloom, she must have a reason..."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan seems to find this very hard to believe.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"My mother has always been a good judge of character, so I can't help but trust her in this. Our situation right now is a bit complicated, though."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan looks uncertain about what to do next.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"As you know, we're currently at war with the Giants, and even though Robinson desperately wants to help, his battle tactics just won't work out here. He just won't accept this fact!"#br##br#
#&53$From Dallan's tone of voice, you can tell that he believes there is no possibility of a partnership between the two.##npc$$821$1#|
11941|#&7$Dallan##br#
"Hmm, if you want to be useful, let me see what tasks need doing..."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan flips through a notebook.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"Ah ha! The hunters based at the New Moon Hunting Grounds could use with a resupply of drinking water, but I have a better idea than just water - something even more useful for the intense work going on out there."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"When you're on the way to the New Moon Hunting Grounds, you'll encounter a strange creature: the Honey Cactoid. These plant creatures are filled with a delicious juice that not only quenches thirst, but increases stamina and hastens the healing process."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"Here, you should take this letter of introduction to Drake so that they don't mistake you for another one of Robinson's pesky soldiers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take the letter and nod. Juicing the cactoids should be simple enough, and you'll also have a prime opportunity to see what it's like on the front lines.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"I hope I don't have to remind you that there is a fierce battle out there, %n%. Watch your back!"#npc$$821$1#|
11942|#&7$Drake##br#
"Listen, we're at war now, you know? I don't have time for idle chatter. Get outta here!"#npc$$821$1#|
11943|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$While explaining your situation, you hand Drake the letter and the Cactus Sap you've collected.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Oh! So Dallan sent you, huh? A supply run, excellent! I was sure you had just showed up to be useless - forgive me, stranger."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Cactus Sap, eh? Good stuff! Let me see that letter..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Whoah! The old lady's recommendation! You must have really impressed her. Do you even know who Kara IS around here?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Taken aback my Drake's shocked expression, you answer that Kara seems to be the local chef...##char$$828$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"A chef?! Hah! Kara was the best hunter in her youth! Not even my father could match her skill, and he still can't! She's the most respected elder in the whole village!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Could you really be as good as she says? You don't look so...nevermind. I guess I'll get you up to speed on our situation here."#npc$$821$1#|
11944|With a letter of introduction in hand, you have been told to set off to the New Moon Hunting Ground to assist out there. On the way, gather some Cactus Sap from the Honey Cactoids to replenish the hunters' strength.

Hunt Honey Cactoids near New Moon Hunting Grounds and collect Cactus Sap. Then deliver the sap and your letter to Drake.|
11951|#&7$Drake##br#
"Most of the hunters here are part of the Second Squad. We just got through with a fierce battle against the Giants. Those Giants...they're immensely powerful!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Within a couple of minutes, we knew we were probably outmatched."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"We've done everything we could to simply survive the attack..."#br##br#
#&53$Drake sighs.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"This is the reason I asked our chief for help - I expected that the Church would send soldiers as backup. Instead, it seems, they've sent us you...alone..."#br##br#
#&53$Drake seems a bit disappointed.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$From what Drake is saying, it's clear that the battle between Hunter and Giant is quite unbalanced.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"I wonder if one of our hunting band leaders, Tanner Jones, has gotten near to the Giants' camp yet. With his assistance, I think there's no way we could possibly lose, but if you look at us now, we're just a sorry bunch..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Bah, no time for sulking! This Cactus Sap is a great help around here. While I'm distributing it amongst the hunters, I'd like you to help me out by having a quick patrol around the perimeter."#npc$$821$1#|
11952|#&7$Drake##br#
"We just need a little bit more time to recover from our last battle, then we can get back out there and fight! But will the Giants really allow us such an opportunity to recover...?"#npc$$821$1#|
11953|#&7$Drake##br#
"Did you find anything out there?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Drake that you saw an army of Giants on the march towards the camp - it won't take long before they arrive.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"What?...No...we're finished! There's no way we can take on a force that large in our weakened state!"#npc$$821$1#|
11954|While Drake distributes the Cactus Sap to the thirsty and weary hunters, he suggests that you go on patrol in case the Giants are mounting another attack.

Keep an eye on the surroundings around the hunters' camp.|
11961|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Not to far from here, you and Drake both hear the sound of the Giants' war-horns and drums.##char$$2$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Here so soon?! What should we do...I need to think!"#br##br#
#&53$Drake paces back and forth anxiously.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You look around and watch the injured trying to prepare for the fight ahead. It's obvious from the mood in the camp that everyone expects this to be their final battle...##char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Drake that you intend to handle the army of Giants on your own. The others should lie in wait in case something goes wrong.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"%n%, have you completely lost it? Those guys are HUGE! They're Cyclops, not some wild ox or a hare! Look at them! You really want to take on an ARMY of them alone?!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"My Envoy will never be alone as long as I'm here!"#br##br#
#&53$%p% nods to you protectively.##pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You smile at %p%. You know in your heart that %p% will always be there for you - no matter what.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"I see...I can't talk you out of it, I guess. If things get bad, don't try to be a hero! You must leave room for a possible retreat, %n%. Be safe."#npc$$821$1#|
11962|#&7$Drake##br#
"Have you changed your mind? No one can take down that army alone, %n%! We can think of a better strategy..."#npc$$821$1#|
11963|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$While you return to the camp to tell Drake of your success over the first wave of Giants, you can already hear his excited voice calling your name.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Unbelievable! To think, a single person just defeated an army of Giants all alone! I'm speechless, that was just...just...amazing!"#br##br#
#&53$Drake can hardly believe his eyes - your skills in battle are something he's never seen.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Even though you did manage to beat them all, I noticed something odd about them. Their techniques looked more honed and organized...they also seemed somehow stronger than last time. How could this be? Something is wrong about all this..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
#&53$Drake calls in other experienced hunters to consult with him on this issue, trying to find a way that could explain the Giants' sudden increase in skill.##npc$$821$1#|
11964|An army of Giants is almost at the camp and there is no way Drake and his band of injured hunters can fight them. It's up to you, and only you, to defend the camp!

Defeat the Stone Hammer Hunters.|
11971|#&7$Drake##br#
"After careful discussion and consideration, we think we have the answer."#br##br#
#&53$Drake looks around at the other hunters awaiting their agreement. They all nod.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"The battle between us hunters and the Giants has lasted for many generations. We know the Giants like the back of our own hands, and something has changed, %n%. There's something strange about their weaponry."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Somehow these weapons are making the Giants much more powerful than before...we're certain."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"%n%, you need to take the weapons from the Giants so that we can inspect them. Maybe then we can really get to the bottom of this."#npc$$821$1#|
11972|#&7$Drake##br#
"We used to be fully capable of taking on a full squad of Giants, but now... We can't even take on a single one! We must get to the bottom of this."#npc$$821$1#|
11973|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the weapons you acquired from the Giants to Drake.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
#&53$Drake calls out to the camp,##br##br#
"Fellow hunters, the weapons are here! Let's figure out what's going on!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"This looks...like nothing out of the ordinary..."#br##br#
#&53$All the hunters begin to talk at once, frantically trying to come up with an answer.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$While the hunters argue, you focus on the weapon and begin to feel a slight energy emanating from it. Thinking back, you realize that it feels similar to the Miracle Stones you found in Demarech Mines! You interrupt the commotion and tell them all what you believe is the source.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Miracle Stone? You mean the stuff mined in Demarech? Hmm..."#br##br#
#&53$The hunters grow quiet; all of them seem to be considering this new information.##npc$$821$1#|
11974|The hunters suspect that there is something strange with the Giants' weapons that enhances their strength, and they would like you to obtain some of these weapons so that they could inspect them.

Defeat Stone Hammer Hunters and take their Heavy Stone Weapons.|
11981|#&7$Drake##br#
"%n%, that is an excellent idea, but I'm not certain if it's correct. In my experiences with Miracle Stone, I've never seen it look or feel quite like these weapons..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"There is a simple test that we can perform on the weapons to prove once and for all that is is, or is not, made of Miracle Stone."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"%n%, the hunters and I know how to make the special reagent to carry out this test, but we'll need a proper container with which to mix it: one made of ox horn."#br##br#
#&53$Drake pauses a moment, trying to recall the best location to procure such an item.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"You'll have to travel to the hunting fields. There you will find the oxen you need to hunt for their horns. The horns have to be hollow, so please make sure you find one that will work!"#npc$$821$1#|
11982|#&7$Drake##br#
"It's hard to believe that these Giants have managed to get their hands on Miracle Stones. I wouldn't have thought the Giants even knew about these things."#npc$$828$1#|
11983|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Drake the Hollow Horns that you found while hunting oxen.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"That hardly took any time at all! Some of the oxen out there must be getting old and slow..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"We're still waiting for the reagent to be ready; then we'll finally begin testing."#br##br#
#&53$Drake watches the other hunters frantically work to create the reagent as fast as possible, and lets out a little chuckle.##npc$$821$1#|
11984|While Drake and his band of hunters work on the reagent that will determine if the Giants' weapons are made of Miracle Stone, you've been asked to collect hollow horns from the oxen roaming around the hunting fields.

Hunt the Horned Oxen and Highland Horned Oxen near the New Moon Hunting Ground until you find Hollow Horns.|
11991|#&7$Aiden##br#
"Everyone is hard at work trying to make the reagent, aren't they?"#br##br#
#&53$Aiden smiles as he watches his fellow villagers work.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"They're so busy and focused that they don't even realize they haven't eaten since early this morning! Typical men of our village - never complaining, even if they're hungry."#br##br#
#&53$Aiden continues to watch the hunters and then turns his attention to you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"Well, we can't let them go hungry, can we? I'd like to cook us up a nice meal for our men here. Would you be willing to help out, %n%?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod. The hunters are beginning to look a bit weary, maybe a good meal would help them recover.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"Excellent! I will be needing some meat from the oxen roaming in the fields. You have experience in hunting them, yes? Bring back some beef chuck and tenderloin. Those'll make a nice meal for us all."#br##br#
#&53$In case you weren't sure which is which, Aiden motions to the parts of the body these cuts of beef come from.##npc$$821$1#|
11992|#&7$Aiden##br#
"Hunting the oxen looks simple, but their horns are quite dangerous! Proceed with caution, lest you meet with the wrath of an angry oxen."#npc$$821$1#|
11993|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand all the meat you've collected to Aiden.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"Hah! Did you see the looks on their faces? Looking at that meat like starved animals! They can hardly even focus on their work anymore with the prospect of food coming up!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aiden##br#
#&53$Aiden laughs while other Hunters seem embarrassed. They lower their heads and try to get back to work.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"If not for you, who knows how long these silly hunters would go hungry! They're too busy to say it right now, but we all thank you for your help with hunting. I'll prepare some nice dishes from this beef. Comin' right up!"#npc$$821$1#|
11994|Aiden noticed that everyone is tired and hungry, so he's requested that you hunt some oxen for a nice meal.

Hunt Horned Oxen and Highland Horned Oxen around the New Moon Hunting Grounds and bring back some Beef Chuck and Beef Tenderloin.|
12001|#&7$Drake##br#
"Aha! It's ready! The reagent's ready! Out of my way! Don't knock this over!#br##br#
#&53$Drake frantically shouts and rushes over to you with the finished reagent.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
#&53$Drake pours the reagent into a hollow horn. He then puts some crumbled stones from the Giants' weapons into the liquid.##br##br#
"That should do it! Once you put the stone into the reagent, all you have to do is wait for the result...it never takes this long, though."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Drake if he knows what's wrong.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Drake##br#
"Normally you can expect fairly quick results with just a few fragments of stone, but it doesn't seem to be working with this type."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"We may need to add a few more fragments than usual as well as add a catalyzer to facilitate the reaction. We don't usually carry such things with us into the field, though."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Drake##br#
"%n%, as we need to report to the chief anyway, you may as well take this back to the village. Here, add the rest of these stone fragments to the reagent, then go to the village and talk to the chief. Maybe he can figure out the problem we're having."#npc$$821$1#|
12002|#&7$Dallan##br#
"Ah, %n%! It's been a while; have the hunters been keeping you on your toes?"#br#
#&53$Dallan seems slightly anxious, even though he's trying to sound cheerful.##npc$$821$1#|
12003|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the reagent to Dallan and tell him all that's transpired. Dallan, without any words, adds the catalyzer to the reagent.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"So many things have been going wrong lately...I'm glad my mother put her trust in you. Without your help out there, Drake and the others would have..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"Ah, the reagent is finally beginning to react. A bit slower than usual, but...it's turned green."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan looks towards the northwest.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"This stone...there's no doubt that it originates from the Beast Statue Altar."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Uncertain about the significance of this, you ask Dallan to explain.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"The reagent turns different colors depending on the source the stone was originally found. This green coloration indicates the presence of Armored Dimetrodon excrement. These beasts are only found living near the Beast Statue Altar in the northwest."#npc$$821$1#|
12004|The hunters have determined that to properly test the stones, they need the addition of a catalyst. As they don't carry this item into the field, they suggest that you take the reagent back to Village Chief Dallan for his expert opinion and addition of the catalyst.

After adding the rest of the stone fragments to the reagent, talk to Dallan back in the village. When the results are determined, you should speak to Drake again.|
12011|#&7$Dallan##br#
"The stone is most certainly from the Beast Statue Altar, but I'm afraid this doesn't help us...This is fairly standard material used by the Giants in their weaponcraft."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, but you still can't help but feel a certain familiarity from the stone. They must be similar to the ones from the Demarech Mines.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% speaks up suddenly,##br##br#
"Could it be...the Cube of Gaia itself? The reason why the Miracle Stones have their power is because of the Cube. If the Cube was used on this type of stone, then maybe it would have a similar effect!#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$If %p% is right, this could mean that the Shadow Knight is nearby, perhaps at the Beast Statue Altar!##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, but recently some hunters were attacked by gigantic creatures while they were near the Beast Statue Altar. This group was lead by Roger Jones, a trustworthy hunter. The attack was brutal, if I remember correctly."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You recall that this attack was the one the Church specifically wanted you to investigate. This can't be a coincidence, certainly you can find some important clues there.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"I've sent a team of hunters lead by Wyatt to investigate. If you're headed there, you should meet up."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"I will shortly be sending along a supply caravan to that area. As you're going that way, you should clear the roads of as many Fuzzy Cactoids as possible to make the area safe for travel."#npc$$821$1#|
12012|#&7$Wyatt##br#
"The battle that took place was incredibly brutal. I can't even imagine what kind of monsters those poor hunters claim to have seen..."#br##br#
#&53$Wyatt looks around warily.##npc$$821$1#|
12013|#&7$Wyatt##br#
"You...you're %n%, right? Weren't you over at the New Moon Hunting Grounds? Is everything alright?!"#br##br#
#&53$Wyatt suddenly looks extremely panicked.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Wyatt what's been going on and why Dallan has sent you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Thank goodness! I was beginning to fear for the worst. I'm glad to hear that Drake and the rest are safe! That's great news, thanks for the update..."#npc$$821$1#|
12014|The test results indicate that the stone sample originated from the Beast Statue Altar in the northwest. Dallan wants you to meet with Wyatt's team of hunters for more information. On the way there, you should make the roads safe for future supply caravans.

Get rid of as many Fuzzy Cactoids as you can, then meet with Wyatt at the Beast Statue Altar.|
12021|#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Dallan sent me and my team here to meet with Roger Jones's group, but as you can see, there's no one here but us! I have no idea where they've gone. They haven't even left any markings that we usually use as communication in times like this."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Things keep getting worse and worse around here..."#br##br#
#&53$Wyatt nervously looks around.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"I intended to have gone deeper into the altar by now, but something's got the dimetrodons all riled up. If we get near them they attack in a frenzy."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"If we want to get further in and potentially find Roger, we'll have to deal with the Armored Dimetrodons first."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod to Wyatt and offer your assistance, certain that you can handle the dimetrodon problem quickly.##char$$821$0#|
12022|#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Everyone! Maintain eye contact with the dimetrodons! If they think they see an opening, they'll attack!"#br##br#
#&53$Wyatt orders his team to keep a steady defense line.##npc$$821$1#|
12023|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report back to Wyatt, letting him know that the dimetrodon issue is solved.##char$$821$0#

"Now I see why Kara put so much faith in you, %n%."#br##br#
#&53$Wyatt smiles, quite impressed.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Let's discuss our next move concerning the altar and Roger."#npc$$821$1#|
12024|The local hunters are trying to continue their search for Roger, but the Armored Dimetrodons in the area are making it impossible to explore past the entrance of the altar. They could really use your expert help at clearing out frenzied monsters.

"My advance scouts have sent reports of a group of outsiders gathering near the altar. They seem to be moving boxes inside, setting up some kind of operation..."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$You suddenly remember the huge amount of Miracle Stones the Shadow Knight stole from the Demarech Mines. Could it be that those stones, combined with the power of the Cube of Gaia, were affecting everything in the area?##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"I've heard that weapons forged of Miracle Stone increase the potential of those who wield it, but we don't have Miracle Stone in this area. What's going on around here? How could our ordinary stones become even remotely like the Miracle Stones?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"The Shadow Knight has stolen the legendary Cube of Gaia from the Demarech Mines! He knows how to wield its power in such a way that it changes everything around him."#pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Obviously, %p% is right. The Shadow Knight has been here and has used the Gaia Cube to alter the altar...But why?"##char$$826:75$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Shadow Knight's true plans are still a mystery to you, but at least you feel you are getting closer to the truth.##char$$809:0$0#|
12034|Wyatt's scouts have reported a group of outsiders near the altar, moving an alarming number of boxes further in. As this is highly unusual, you've been tasked with a deeper investigation.

Examine the mysterious boxes and bring back any important evidence you find.|
12041|#&7$Wyatt##br#
#&53$After a long pause, Wyatt finally speaks.##br##br#
"So it's true, the Shadow Knight is really here..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"%n%, if these invaders are the Shadow Knight's henchmen, do you think you could find some clues as to his plan from them?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod in agreement with Wyatt, it's true that it would be the most direct way, even though it would cause a lot of commotion.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Then it's settled. You will go do what you can about those evil minions, while my team continues to look for Roger. If you need any help, feel free to ask me."#npc$$821$1#|
12042|#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Those guys look pretty tough, so watch your back out there, %n%. Don't forget to let me know if you need anything, we've gotta be a team out here."#npc$$821$1#|
12043|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You show Wyatt the map you found off of one of the marauders, hoping he can tell you what region it depicts.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"This... This is a map of Candeo Marsh. It could be that this is the Shadow Knight's next point of attack."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You instantly recall the Grand Bishop's warning that the Shadow Knight's influence had reached not only the Triatio Highlands but Candeo Marsh as well. Before you can ask Wyatt more questions, you notice the deeply worried expression on his face. The other hunters in his team begin to nervously approach him.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Village Hunter##br#
"Wyatt, sir, we have to make our next move soon! Should we team up to rescue Roger or go to help the other hunters first? Whatever decision we make, we have to act soon before it's too late..."#M122020$Village Hunter$821$0#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"I'm not sure if we have the skill set to rescue Roger on our own - he's completely surrounded! Even so, I'm worried about how long he will be able to last out there alone."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Clearly some new information about Roger and his companion hunters has arisen. You ask Wyatt to update you on the current situation.##char$$806:0$0#|
12044|You decide to part ways with the hunters for a while in order to pursue your findings on the Shadow Knight. You think you have a good chance of finding some new information from his lackeys.

Attack the Marauder Lackeys and see if you can find any clues on them. The more you drive out of the area, the better.|
12051|#&7$Wyatt##br#
"After we separated, the other hunters and I snuck into the altar in search of Roger. Little did we know, the Avians were holding one of their worship rituals."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"I think I saw a man trapped near the altar. I can't be sure, but since Roger is missing...He could have been captured by this group of Avians."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$With this news brought to light, you offer your aid in his rescue.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"I was hoping you'd say that, %n%! I've already worked out a plan. We'll separate into groups, and while one group provides a distraction for the Avians the other will sneak in and rescue Roger. I think you will be the best for the job, as you're the fastest among us."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Sounds good? Then it's settled. We'll distract the Avians from all around, while you sneak in and get Roger out of there in one piece!"#npc$$821$1#|
12052|#&7$Tied Avian##br#
"What is wrong with the rest of you! Why am I in here?! Do you really mean to sacrifice me?! I'm one of you! Get me out of heeeere!"#br#
#&53$A trapped Avian is shouting from the altar and trying to escape.##npc$$821$1#|
12053|#&7$Imprisoned Avian##br#
"Release me! Now! I'm too young to die! I have hopes! Dreams!" The person in the cage is clearly not Roger, but a very frantic Avian!#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You do your best to calm the Avian and tell him you'll free him. No one deserves to be sacrificed!##char$$821$0#

#&7$Imprisoned Avian##br#
"Really?! A human would do that for me?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"Wow, thank you...My name is Puckett, and yourself?#br##br#
#&53$Puckett seems to have relaxed slightly, but isn't quite sure if he should trust you or not.##M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly introduce yourself to Puckett and ask him what's going on.##char$$821$0#|
12054|Wyatt, while exploring deeper into the altar, thinks he saw someone tied up as a potential sacrifice. Since Roger has gone missing, he thinks it might be him. You should rescue him as soon as possible!

Go to save the one tied to the altar before he used as a sacrifice.|
12061|#&7$Puckett##br#
"I better start at the beginning... I'm a member of the Argus Cult. We believe that the great Abyssal Demon Argus will someday rise to this world, to display his awesome might. I never doubted it... Until now."#M010010$Puckett$829$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"Not too long ago, a very strange and frightening human showed up around here. He was clad in all black armor and a feeling of great evil struck fear into my heart. He and his followers began to spend a lot of time at our altar."#M010010$Puckett$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your heart nearly skips a beat as Puckett describes the Shadow Knight perfectly. You never thought your next witness would be an Avian. Silently, you wait for Puckett to continue his tale.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"The dark stranger's followers began transporting many boxes into the altar... I couldn't resist my curious nature, so I snuck in, intending to take a peek inside the boxes."#M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"While hiding, I saw that man raise a strange glowing stone - a perfect square - above his head. Suddenly, it was like a great storm had formed on the altar..."#M010010$Puckett$825$1##&PP00702#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"Ordinary looking stones began to rise into the air, moving as if they were somehow alive! They lumped together rapidly to form a humongous creature! It was terrifying!"#M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Did you hear that? This must be the huge mysterious creature we've been hearing about! It was created by the Cube of Gaia..."#pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod to %p%. So, the gigantic demon creature wreaking havoc in the Triatio Highlands was in fact a creature of the Shadow Knight! Just like the Rock Beetles in Demarech Mines, the Gaia Cube has brought another stone monstrosity to life...##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"As you can imagine, I was quite terrified... So I returned to my people and approached the Elder with what I saw. They now think it's the Abyssal Demon Argus, risen into our realm! Since I was the first to lay eyes upon him, our teachings proclaim that I must be sacrificed to him!"#M010010$Puckett$829$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"I tried my best to escape, but no matter how far I got, the Beastmasters and their Game Birds would find me! Please, I really want to get out of here, but I have no chance against their tracking skills. If you really want to free me, they must be dealt with first."#M010010$Puckett$828$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"If not, it'll only be a matter of time until I'm back here!"#M010010$Puckett$826$1#|
12062|#&7$Puckett##br#
"The Beastmasters and their Game Birds make an incredible hunting team. When I was young, it was my dream to join their ranks."#M010010$Puckett$827$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"I never expected to be hunted by one of my heroes..."#M010010$Puckett$823$1#|
12063|#&7$Puckett##br#
"Did you really defeat every last one? They're the best fighters in our entire village!"#br##br#
#&53$Puckett looks all around, surprised to see how many Beastmasters have fallen.##M010010$Puckett$2$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"Fast! You defeated them so quickly...what kind of human are you?!"#M010010$Puckett$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Puckett that you are an Envoy of Gaia, sent by the Church in pursuit of the Shadow Knight. He is the one who, by use of the Gaia Cube, created the rock monster in order to manipulate the Avians.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"This Shadow Knight you're after is the same black clad one I saw? Being around him felt so...Hey, wait a minute! I feel a similar power from you! Not evil, and not quite as strong, but...powerful!"#br##br#
#&53$Puckett glances at %p%, looking uncomfortable.##M010010$Puckett$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Puckett's sharp Avian senses have quickly discovered the similarities between you and the Shadow Knight: You are both Envoys of Gaia, true, yet he senses that your power is not as strong as the Shadow Knight.##char$$826:0$0#|
12064|Upon closer investigation, you found that it wasn't Roger tied up at the altar, but an Avian named Puckett. To rescue him from impending doom, you must first eliminate the Beastmasters who will certainly track him down again.

Eliminate Argus Beastmasters and Argus Game Birds at the Beast Statue Altar.|
12071|#&7$Puckett##br#
"This Shadow Knight is truly an evil man! I should be back at my camp, just singing and reading and enjoying my day! I can't belie-"#br##br#
#&53$Suddenly, the piercing cry of a Game Bird interrupts Puckett and his eyes widen.##M010010$Puckett$825$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"No! They're after us again! No no no! So close to escape, but so far away!"#br##br#
#&53$Puckett looks about in a panic.##M010010$Puckett$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You asked Puckett if it's possible to break the control the Beastmasters have over the Game Birds.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"The Game Birds are still wild, they're just under a spell cast by the Beastmasters..."#M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"If you were to capture them and take them out of the spell's range, they should revert back to regular old wild Game Birds with no interest in us."#M010010$Puckett$825$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
#&53$Puckett hands you a gunny bag.##br##br#
"These bags are normally used to transport sacrificial offerings. I bet you can use these to capture them! Then you'll just have to take the Game Birds to the furthest cliff from the village and set them free."#M010010$Puckett$826$1#|
12072|#&7$Puckett##br#
"If you can just get the Game Birds out of range of the Beastmasters' spell, then the Game Birds should revert back to normal with their connection to the Beastmasters severed."#M010010$Puckett$821$1#|
12073|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Puckett that you've set the Argus Game Birds free. They should no longer be a threat.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"Nice work! I've already seen some of the Beastmasters retreating back to camp; they seemed really confused and were making quite a commotion about it. It's great! It's such a relief to not have to be worried about being tracked down anymore."#M010010$Puckett$821$1#|
12074|To release the Game Birds from the Argus Beastmasters' control, and make it easier to escape, Puckett suggests that you capture them in a Gunny Bag and take them far enough to break the spell.

Use the Gunny Bag to catch Game Birds, then take them to a faraway cliff and set them free.|
12081|#&7$Puckett##br#
"Sooo, uhh...it's nice that the Beastmasters are taken care of and all, but I'm still stuck in this cage! It takes a specific magical key to open it..."#M010010$Puckett$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Puckett if he remembers where to find the key.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"If my memory is correct, the Argus Acolyte, Ikanu should have the key. I think he should be nearby praying to Argus, but..."#M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"He'll definitely be protected by guards, and he himself is very skilled in magic, so he won't go down easily..."#M010010$Puckett$826$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"Can you handle it, %n%? We've come so far, surely you can rescue me for real! Please, get me out of here!"#M010010$Puckett$829$1#|
12082|#&7$Puckett##br#
"Did you find the key? Please, you must hurry! The village could be sending guards any moment now!"#M010010$Puckett$821$1#|
12083|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You show the key to Puckett and watch his face light up in excitement.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"I can still hardly believe my village would do this to me...Thank you from rescuing me from this horrible fate."#M010010$Puckett$826$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"I didn't believe for a second that the rock monster summoned by the Shadow Knight was the Abyssal Demon Argus, but our Elder has managed to persuade everybody that it is! I don't think I can go back there..."#M010010$Puckett$829$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"The Elder has gone with that fake Demon to the Deep's Cavern in the southwest. I hope this can help you to stop that evil shadow man."#M010010$Puckett$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Puckett for any details regarding Deep's Cavern.##char$$821$0#|
12084|Argus Acolyte Ikanu possesses the magic key that can release Puckett. Obtaining this key is the only way to free Puckett from the cage.

12091|#&7$Puckett##br#
"Well... Deep's Cavern is supposed to be an Avian secret, but..."#br##br#
#&53$Puckett hesitates.##M010010$Puckett$823$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"I already can't go back, so I might as well tell you everything. You have saved my life, after all...my people already intended to kill me!"#M010010$Puckett$825$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"According to our legends, the great power of the Abyssal Demon Argus is sealed within the cave. If anyone could unlock its power, they would be come invincible."#M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"If that gigantic stone creature is already so powerful, I don't think anyone will be able to stop it!"#M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You look Puckett in the eye and tell him with all confidence that you will defeat it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"I believe you! I really, truly do! Unfortunately, I probably won't be around to see it. I should really leave this place..."#br##M010010$Puckett$826$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"Once again, I thank you deeply for your help, %n%. If we ever meet again, I'll do my best to return the favor!"#M010010$Puckett$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After parting ways with Puckett, you think it's about time to check in with Wyatt. He needs to hear the news about Roger not being the one on the altar, as well as the updated information on the Shadow Knight and the rock monster mistaken for the Abyssal Demon Argus. You also think it might be a good idea to check in with Squad Leader Robinson.##clean$$1#|
12092|#&7$Robinson##br#
"%n%, you're back! What have you been up to? I've been doing nothing but guarding this little village. Nothing has been happening here! I'm going stir crazy! Any news?"#npc$$821$1#|
12093|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Robinson all about the hunter team's failed attack and how the team has fallen apart, leaving Roger missing. Not forgetting your encounter with the Avians, you also describe Puckett's predicament with the Argus cult and their belief that the giant monster created by the Shadow Knight is the Abyssal Demon ascended.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Hmm, it could be that this gigantic creature you speak of has been hidden away in this secret Deep's Cavern. My patrolling soldiers have yet to find any sign of the thing, so that may be our best chance."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"As the Deep's Cavern is Avian territory, what happens next has no ties to the Hunters, do you agree, Dallan?"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"This...Deep's Cavern has nothing to do with our people, it is true. You may do as you wish in that regard, but be warned: that area is crawling with violent beasts. Not even our most skilled hunters dare to tread that area unless they absolutely have to."#M111030$Dallan$821$0#|
12094|According to Avian legend, an incredible power has been sealed into the Deep's Cavern by the Abyssal Demon, Argus. If the Shadow Knight's gigantic stone creation obtains it, his powers will grow exponentially - possibly making him invulnerable! You decide to take your leave of Wyatt to return to the Hunting Village and consult with Robinson.

Part ways with Wyatt and head back to the Hunting Village for a talk with Robinson about what to do next.|
12095|#&7$Wyatt##br#
"%n%! Thank goodness, you're alive! You've been gone for so long! What happened? Did you find Roger? Is he..."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Wyatt everything and everyone you encountered in the Beast Statue Altar.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"We discovered, not too long after you left, the coded message left by Roger. It had been defaced by something unknown, so we had trouble recognizing it earlier. I'm both happy and sad that he is not the one you found on the altar...at least then we'd know where he is..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"In Roger's message, he describes that his team was attacked by a gigantic monster and had to retreat. We've just heard from the village that some of the hunters had returned, but Roger is still missing."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"I'll have to talk with the Village Chief about what to do about this gigantic monster, but with everyone embroiled in the battle against the Giants, I'm afraid we won't find many available to take on yet another battle..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wyatt##br#
"Well, %n%, I'll return to the village now to let everyone know what's been going on. With your new-found clues about your own personal investigation, I think you should talk to your Squad Leader about them, don't you?"#npc$$822$1#|
12101|#&7$Robinson##br#
"I think it's a safe bet that this giant creature that the Avians believe is Argus has already entered the cavern."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It seems that both you and Squad Leader Robinson are in agreement: you must find the Deep's Cavern and search for the Shadow Knight's creation. Still uncertain about the location, you ask Robinson and Dallan if they have found it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"This is just speculation, but I believe the Deep's Cavern is the cave entrance I noticed in the southwest. While I was still a fair distance off from it, I felt an ominous sensation about it, so I sent some troops to stand guard nearby. Could this be the place?"#br##br#
#&53$Robinson looks to Dallan for confirmation.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"You're right, I believe. That ancient cavern could very well be the one the Avian's call 'Deep's Cavern.' Long ago, our people stopped going near there because of the same feeling of which you spoke. It now serves as a dwelling for beasts."#M111030$Dallan$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"As I'm certain you won't be swayed from this dangerous plan, I would like to suggest that you return to the New Moon Hunting Grounds first and talk with Aiden. He is the most familiar with the area and should be able to offer a fair bit of information about it."#M111030$Dallan$821$0#

#&7$Robinson##br#
#&53$Not expecting any cooperation whatsoever from Dallan, Robinson doesn't know what to say.##br##br#
"Er, well...that's all for now, %n%. After speaking with that hunter, meet up with the Vanguard Soldiers near the cavern entrance."#npc$$828$1#|
12102|#&7$Soldier##br#
"Are you our special reinforcement?"#npc$$821$1#|
12103|#&7$Walter##br#
"Aah... It's %n%! Great news! I never thought I'd see you out here in the wilderness. I'm 1st Class Soldier Walter. I've seen you around Navea. It's an honor to serve with you, %n%."#npc$$821$1#|
12104|Robinson, feeling something strange about the area near the cavern, has already sent soldiers to patrol the exterior of the cavern. Before you head there, Dallan suggests meeting with Aiden, as he is familiar with the area and could provide crucial information.

Go to the New Moon Hunting Grounds to talk with Aiden, and then meet Walter outside of the Ancient Lair.|
12105|#&7$Aiden##br#
"Hail, %n%, what news? I didn't expect to see you back here any time soon. We've only just learned that the missing hunters have begun to return to the village. How are things going on your end? Did you find any of the clues you were after?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly explain all that's happened to Aiden and ask for his insight on the Deep's Cavern.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"Deep's Cavern, eh? Well, not many people go near there anymore, especially not since the Avians of the Argus Cult claimed it as a holy place. According to rumor, it seems that the Avian ancestors have left some Magic Circles inside that store magic power."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"The cavern has gone unoccupied for ages and is now home to many ferocious beasts, dwelling both in and outside of it. I can tell you for certain that the outer areas are occupied by aggressive Dimetrodons. They seem to be much more ferocious than Dimetrodons found anywhere else in our lands."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aiden##br#
"I know you're going to want to enter that cave, but please be careful - I do not know what lies in wait within. If what lurks outside is already an incredible threat..."#npc$$821$1#|
12111|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Walter why you are here#br#
in hopes that he can help you get past the Dimetrodons and into the cave.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
"Well... It's going to be very difficult to get close to the cave entrance.#br#
Just look around and see how many vicious beasts there are!#br#
We have only a few people..."#M121030$Walter$823$1#

#&7$Hunter##br#
"Wouldn't we be able to minimize our losses if we avoid a frontal attack?"#br#
One hunter cuts into the discussion.#M104040$Hunter$821$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
"Sorry, I forgot to introduce you two.#br#
This is Rachel, from Hunter Village.#br#
She is in charge of supplies for the hunting party.#br#
She's very familiar with this place."#M121030$Walter$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"So Rachel, do you have any ideas?"#M121030$Walter$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br# 
"Nothing special.#br#
We simply need to prepare properly for the assault.#br#
Let's get to work!" #M121030$Rachel$825$0#

#&7$Rachel##br# 
"Hmm... you're %n%, right?#br#

"I have here a bottle of anesthetic poison that we will be applying to these thorns. We will then use the thorns as blow darts that'll take down the beasts. When they become weakened, then we will strike.#npc$$821$1#|
12114|Rachel, from the hunter village, believes that it would be wise to avoid a head-on attack with the beasts in front of the Ancient Lair. Without further explanation, she asks you to retrieve the thorns of nearby cacti.

"Be careful while handling these thorns! If you prick yourself, you'll be stuck in bed recovering for quite a while."#br##br#
#&53$Rachel walks amongst the soldiers as they apply anesthetic to the needles.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
#&53$Rachel pauses in front of you and looks lost in thought.##br##br#
"While we prepare the blow darts, you will prepare the blowpipes for us, %n%."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"If you go to the west, you should come across many amaranth plants."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"These plants have hollow stems, so with just a bit of work we can fashion them into blowpipes for our darts."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"Do you think you can handle this task, %n%? Great! I'll be keeping an eye over the soldiers here so none of them get themselves poisoned. If you don't have any questions, you can head out now."#npc$$824$1#|
12122|#&7$Rachel##br#
"Hollow Amaranth grows in the west, not far away from here. The plant is pretty common and we usually make blowguns for ourselves with these. Blowguns are particularly useful for taking down dangerous predators."#npc$$821$1#|
12123|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After picking enough Hollow Amaranth stems, you return and hand them to Rachel.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"This is a fine collection of Hollow Amaranths you've gathered, %n%. They'll make excellent blowpipes. Have you ever considered life as a hunter? You'd make a fine one, I'm sure."#npc$$821$1#|
12124|Rachel intends to use Blowdart Tranquilizers to deal with the vicious beasts patrolling outside the Ancient Lair. To make the blowpipes, she needs you to gather Hollow Amaranth.

Find Hollow Amaranth to the west of the Ancient Lair and bring them back to Rachel.|
12131|#&7$Rachel##br#
"Everyone is still working on their blow darts, so I can't leave for now. Do you think you can help me with something?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Rachel that you promise to help out, as she is helping you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"While I stay and monitor the manufacture of the blow darts, I could really use your help in hunting. I was in the region to hunt for our village when I got stopped by these soldiers."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"A herd of Shaggy Oxen is nearby that I planned to hunt in order to replenish our food supply for the next few days. But now I'm pretty occupied with helping these soldiers..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"While I continue to oversee these soldiers, do you think you can hunt some of the oxen? I don't want my fellow hunters to go hungry while doing battle with the Giants."#npc$$827$1#|
12132|#&7$Rachel##br#
"%n%, have you gone hunting yet? The blow darts will be ready soon. I hope you haven't forgotten your promise!"#npc$$821$1#|
12133|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Rachel the Shaggy Ox Meat that you've successfully hunted and her eyes light up with joy.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"Are you certain you're not secretly a hunter, %n%? This beef looks excellent! And you've gotten way more than I ever expected!"#npc$$821$1#|
12134|While Rachel does her best to oversee the manufacture of blowdarts, she could really use your help in obtaining food for her fellow hunters. She suggests an exchange of work: she'll finish the blowdarts while you procure the food.

Hunt some Shaggy Oxen outside the Ancient Lair, and bring Rachel some Shaggy Ox Meat.

12141|#&7$Rachel##br#
"Alright, looks like we're all done! Gather around everyone and I'll pass out the blow darts, we have enough for everyone. Next, I'll explain to you the rest of the plan."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"Remember, soldiers, these are sharp! Don't get stuck by the thorns, we need each and every one of you in top shape!"#br##br#
#&53$Walter reminds his team to handle the darts with care.##M121030$Walter$823$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"It'll take a while before the anesthetic takes action, so we must first work on the Dimetrodons."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"This amount of anesthetic is not enough to completely take out a Dimetrodon, but they will become weak! After the poison takes its effect, you should be able to swiftly take them down."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"%n%, this is your blow dart. Use it wisely and accurately, and the battles ahead will be much easier."#npc$$821$1#|
12142|#&7$Rachel##br#
"I'm worried about these soldiers, %n%. They're just so used to facing things head on!"#br##br#
#&53$Rachel looks with concern as the soldiers examine their blow darts.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"Well, it's no use worrying...Hopefully these soldiers can quickly learn to adapt new tactics."#br##br#
#&53$Rachel laughs as she watches the soldiers.##npc$$821$1#|
12143|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After using the Tranquilizer Blowdart on the Dimetrodons, you return to Rachel with confirmation that the poison has taken its effect.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"It's already worked? That is unusually fast...Still, let's wait a moment and see how they react once they wake up. When they're still sluggish is the best time to strike. Patience is the key!"#npc$$821$1#|
12144|With the blowdarts finally ready, it's time to strike at the ferocious Dimetrodons!

Use the blowdarts to weaken the Clawed Dimetrodons and Wild Dimetrodons.|
12151|#&7$Walter##br#
"Look at that! The Dimetrodons can hardly stand! I had no idea that Rachel's anesthetic could have such a profound effect. We've learned a valuable tactic today, everyone!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"Now is our time to strike! Let's show them what a soldier of the Church can do. Before the poison wears off, kill as many Dimetrodons as you are able!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"%n%, please join us; we'll try to advance directly to the cavern's entrance."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and look ahead, noticing how the legs of the Dimetrodons shake from simply standing. You can tell they are still aggressive, but their fighting capabilities are severely weakened.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
"If something goes wrong, you'll know where to find us. Alright, soldiers, no more words. Time for action!"#npc$$822$1#|
12152|#&7$Walter##br#
"Now its our time to shine! We'll show those Dimetrodons who's boss!"#br#
#&53$The soldiers are all psyched about the upcoming battle.##npc$$821$1#|
12153|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Walter that you've taken down a great number of Dimetrodons and ask how everyone else fared.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
"We all fought together admirably, of course! We even managed to make it to the cavern entrance before you. However...we never expected what we saw there. The stones on the ground...they started to move!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"When we took a closer look, we saw that these moving stones were actually some kind of strange bugs. There were so many of them that we decided to regroup back here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Walter that you've encountered such bugs before and know how to take care of them. Thinking back to the phenomenon in the Demarech Mines, you are sure that this is not just coincidence...##char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$There's no doubt now that the giant rock monster seen by Puckett is a creation of the Shadow Knight and the Cube of Gaia. It must be hiding deep within the cavern.##char$$806:0$0#|
12154|Now that the anesthetic has worked, it's time to eliminate the Dimetrodons.

"Our strength is nothing compared to yours, %n%! Just dealing with the weakened Dimetrodons was enough to tire all of us out..."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"Yet here you are, still full of fighting spirit!"#br##br#
#&53$Walter, though tired, gives you a big smile.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Walter that you'll clear out the Rock Beetles surrounding the cavern entrance while the soldiers recover their strength.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
"Good thinking. We'll revise our strategy while you take care of those strange rock creatures."#npc$$828$1#|
12162|#&7$Walter##br#
"I think we must revise our strategy to focus around the support of %n%...It's not wise for us to simply rush in on our own to something we don't understand."#br##br#
#&53$Walter and his soldiers consider different battle strategies based around how best to support you...##npc$$821$1#|
12163|#&7$Walter##br#
"%n%, you're back! Just in time, we've discovered some vital information."#br##br#
#&53$Walter looks very worried..##M121030$Walter$823$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"This is Hermione. She used to study a few basic spells at the Magic Academy. Hermione, please tell him what you've discovered."#M121030$Walter$821$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"At first I thought I was just imagining things, so I didn't tell anyone, but..."#M123010$Hermione$821$0#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"Here's what happened. While we were rushing closer and closer to the cave entrance, I felt a strong pressure from inside the cave. I think someone's cast a spell on the entrance."#M123010$Hermione$828$0#|
12164|The soldiers need some time to rest after their battle with the Dimetrodons, so you decide to clear away the Rock Beetles near the entrance as you are still full of strength.

"This spell is very advanced. As a junior sorcerer, I've only learned the basics..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"At the academy, my mentor once mentioned an extremely powerful barrier spell that not only isolates the area, but can bring harm to any trying to pass through by force."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"For our safety, I think we should examine the entrance before we try to enter and make sure that my senses are correct."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Hermione what she thinks you should do to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"I'm not yet skilled enough to cast Magic Telepathy on my own, but I think the Argus Rock Beetles have some magic power resonating from the rocks on their bodies. If you can bring me some of those rocks, I may be able to harness the power..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Nodding, you agree that you'll collect some of these rocks from the Rock Beetles and return shortly.##char$$806:0$0#|
12172|#&7$Hermione##br#
"Thank you for hearing me out. I hope I'm not just paranoid...I just want to make sure everyone will be safe!"#npc$$821$1#|
12173|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You return from the cavern entrance, having collected a few stones from the Rock Beetles.##char$$821$0#

"%n%, thank you for getting these for me...it's a big help."#br##br#
#&53$Hermione blushes in embarrassment.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"So...let's see..."#br##br#
#&53$Hermione gathers up the stones and begins to incant a spell.##npc$$311$1#|
12174|Hermione suspects that a magical barrier has been cast upon the entrance of the cave, but lacks the power on her own to cast a spell to reveal it. If you can gather some rocks from the Rock Beetles, they should have enough residual magic to let her cast her spell.

#&53$Hermione's energy seems completely drained after casting her spell.##npc$$501$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"That's incredible, Hermione..."#br##br#
#&53$Walter and the other soldiers begin to relax and smile at the beauty of the crystal ball.##M121030$Walter$828$0#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"%n%, take this Crystal Ball and smash it right in front of the entrance. The Magic Energy it contains will make the invisible barrier appear, if there is one..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"It's the only way for us to be sure if my feelings are correct."#br##br#
#&53$Hermione wipes the sweat from her brow and tries to relax.##npc$$829$1#|
12182|#&7$Hermione##br#
"That was really rough... since leaving the Magic Academy, I haven't cast a single spell until now..."#M123010$Hermione$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
"You've done a great thing today, Hermione. When we return to Navea, I'd strongly suggest that you return to the Magic Academy; even I can recognize your talent! You shouldn't let such a skill go to waste."#M121030$Walter$821$0#|
12183|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell everyone that you did indeed see a barrier in front of the cave after smashing the crystal ball.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"So I was right... there really is a magic barrier there... I'm not sure what to do next..."#M123010$Hermione$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Hermione if she is familiar with any way to break the barrier.##char$$821$0#

"Both the Avians and Giants are capable of casting spells. But everybody knows that, right?"#br##br#
#&53$Nobody responds, so Rachel sighs and continues to explain.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"It's possible that one of their groups has cast this spell. If so, even though they're not involved in this, they might know how to remove it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Rachel what she suggests to do about gathering such information.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"As the hunters are at war with the Giants, and we hardly even talk to the Avians...It'll be hard for us to just walk up and ask for their help, obviously."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"I think the best course of action is to head towards the Stone Hammer Tribe. There, you can meet with Tanner Jones, one of our expert hunters. If you two work together, I think you'll be able to capture some Stone Hammer Sorcerers for questioning."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"If you'll be going to meet with Tanner, it'd be great if you could deliver this meat to him from me. I still have to go to the New Moon Hunting Grounds and deliver supplies to Drake, so that would save me some time."#npc$$821$1#|
12192|#&7$Tanner##br#
"If things keep carrying on like this, we'll lose the war..."#br##br#
#&53$Tanner looks deeply troubled; the situation between the Giants and Humans is not going well.##npc$$826$1#|

"Hm? Where did you get all this? This is Rachel's delivery...is she ok?!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You briefly introduce yourself and explain what's been going on near Deep's Cavern.##char$$821$0#|
12194|The magic barrier cast over the cavern's entrance has put a stop to your plan for now. Rachel suggests that you meet with Tanner Jones and ask him for help in gathering information about the Giants' Magic. She would also be very grateful if you would deliver some Shaggy Ox Meat in her stead.

12201|#&7$Tanner##br#
"Ah ha! You're the %n% I keep hearing about! You've gained quite a following back in the village - every hunter keeps talking about your good deeds. I hear that without your help, an entire team of hunters would have met their doom! Good work, %n%!"#br##br#
#&53$Tanner pats you on the back with a thankful smile on his face.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"I'm glad that you've made your way out here, %n%, the situation here is getting grim. I think you've heard about this, but the Giants definitely have some strange new weapon on their side. It seems to give them quite a boost in power."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Let's work together on this, shall we? You, use your superb fighting skills to take out these Giants, while I do what I can to find the answers you seek."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After careful thought, you agree that working together will be the best decision for both of you. With more people on your side who are familiar with the Giants, you'll certainly be able to uncover some information.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Here's the first order of business. We'll destroy the materials the Stone Hammer Tribe have been using to manufacture these powerful weapons."#npc$$821$1#

"%n%, you should have no trouble with this, right? Show me these legendary skills I keep hearing about!"#npc$$821$1#|
12202|#&7$Tanner##br#
"Thanks for offering to help. I know that you and the other hunters discovered my brother Roger's message...But I'm still worried about him. We still haven't heard from him since..."#br##br#
#&53$Tanner sighs.##npc$$821$1#|
12203|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having returned from smashing the ore used by the Stone Hammer Tribe to craft weapons, you tell Tanner of your successful operation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Since I became a leader amongst the Hunters, I have sought out peace with the Giant Chief. The thing about Giants is...even the thought of peace is like surrender. And for the Giants, well, surrender is not in their nature..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"It seems that if we ever want to negotiate hunting rights, we'll have to outright defeat the Giants, no matter what. It's the only way to get through to the Chief, sadly."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"We both know that if we want to succeed against the Giants, we must first deal with these strange weapons. Otherwise, we'll just be beaten into submission, no matter how cunning a plan we hatch."#npc$$2$1#

"I've done some investigating on your spell situation, and this is what I've found..."#br##br#
#&53$Tanner pauses a moment before continuing.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"From what I've learned about Giants, when their elder casts arcane spells, he must use a medium. The medium is just a simple runestone commonly found in human practices."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"If the barrier cast over the Ancient Lair is really a work of a Giant Elder, you should be able to find the corresponding runestone that could cancel the spell."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Finding this particular runestone is likely your safest bet of breaking the barrier. Perhaps if you were to collect as many runestones as you can from the Giants, we'll be able to discern which one could remove the barrier."#npc$$821$1#|
12222|#&7$Tanner##br#
"Giants are quite different from humans, especially in regards to magic. Their affinity with magic is so low that they absolutely must use a medium to keep their spells working."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"This creates a great weakness on their part, because all one has to do to break the spell is destroy the corresponding runestone."#npc$$825$1#|
12223|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand over all the runestones you managed to collect from the Giants.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Hmm...None of these look like the one we're after...Most of them are simply for traps or for putting out fire. There are even some for storing food..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"It would seem that the barrier at the Ancient Lair is not of the Giants' creation..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After all your hard work, disarming and infiltrating the Stone Hammer Tribe, this revelation leaves you feeling quite discouraged.##char$$809:80$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Chin up, %n%! Recovering these runestones is still extremely useful for us. Now all I have to do is destroy them and the Giants will be defenseless! Even though we didn't find the outcome you sought, this is quite a significant development for us hunters."#npc$$825$1#|
12224|If the barrier over Deep's Cavern was created by the Giants, all you need to do is obtain the correct runestone from a Stone Hammer Mystic and smash it to remove the spell.

"Everything is set in motion, then. I will go discuss terms with Chief Amon. %n%, you should relax a while and enjoy what little luxuries we have at our camp. I'll be sure to ask the chief about this barrier for you."#br##br#
#&53$Tanner smiles at you and turns to leave, ready to put this battle to rest.##M126050$Tanner$821$1#

#&53$* Should you accept this quest, you will undertake the task as Tanner.#|
12232|#&7$Tanner##br#
"The key here is to not make any unreasonable demands of Amon. The primary goal of these talks is to bring peace to all our people."#M126050$Tanner$821$1#|
12233|#&7$Tanner##br#
"From here forward, the New Moon Hunting Ground will be evenly shared between both the Hunters and Giants!"#M126050$Tanner$821$1#

#&7$Elite Hunter##br#
"Hooray!"#M122010$Elite Hunter$824$0#

#&7$Elite Hunter##br#
"This is a true victory! Peace! Peace!"#M124030$Elite Hunter$825$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"This war, spanning generation after generation, is finally over..."#br##br#
#&53$With everybody cheering joyfully, Tanner feels relieved for the first time in what seems like ages.##M126050$Tanner$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You congratulate Tanner for the final and peaceful end of the war between the Hunters' Mountain Village and the Stone Hammer Tribe.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"I owe this victory to you, %n%. Without your help during this trying time, I know that we would have met with defeat..."#M126050$Tanner$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% looks slightly embarrassed and seems to really want to say something...##pet$$1$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% turns to Tanner.##br##br#
"Noble human, I'm sorry I thought you'd just banish the Giants from the land. You are just like %n%! A human truly worthy of respect."#pet$$821$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
#&53$Tanner, taken by surprise, then begins to laugh as he turns back to you.##br##br#
"%n%, that's quite a unique partner you have!"#M126050$Tanner$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and can't help but laugh along with Tanner.##char$$806:71$0#|
12234|At last, the Hunters have finally won the war! Tanner is now going to negotiate with the Stone Hammer Tribe's Chief, Amon - hopefully for peace.

Playing the role of Tanner, go to the Stone Hammer Tribe to establish the terms of negotiation with Stone Hammer Chief Amon.|
12241|#&7$Tanner##br#
"By the way, %n%, I didn't forget to ask about this mysterious barrier. Chief Amon said he definitely did not order any sort of barrier over Deep's Cavern. He actually thought I was attempting to mock the Giants' lack of magical expertise..."#M126050$Tanner$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$So, the magic barrier has nothing to do with the Giants after all. Consulting the Avians is the only alternative, however...##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Thinking back on the rescue of Puckett and your resounding defeat over the Argus Cult, simply asking the Avians will no longer be an easy matter.##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"While we were working to achieve peace with the Giants, it seems that some new issue has arisen...Our village chief has asked me if I can spare any of our team to deploy to the northwest. It would seem something is going on there."#M126050$Tanner$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"According to the chief, reports of the sounds of a great battle, and even severe earthquakes, seem to be coming from the northwest; so he has sent the majority of our hunters to investigate."#M126050$Tanner$821$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"I would go have a look myself, but I must return to the village first to let the people know about the peace agreement we have reached with the Giants."#M126050$Tanner$828$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"I need you to take charge in the northwest for me, %n%. Journey over there and find out what's really going on!"#M126050$Tanner$821$1#|
12242|#&7$Badly Injured Hunter##br#
"Which squad do you belong to? I've never seen you before..."#br##br#
#&53$The hunter seems exhausted, and it's too hard to tell the full extent of his injuries...##npc$$828$1#|
12243|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the injured hunter that you were sent by the Church in pursuit of the Shadow Knight, but, for the moment, are here on Tanner's request to investigate the fighting in the northwest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"Tanner? Is...is he alright? I'm Roger Jones, his older brother."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$With wide eyes, you realize that the injured hunter before you is the missing Roger Jones! You never expected to come across him accidentally!##char$$823:0$0#|
12244|Tanner has returned to the village to spread the good news of the peace treaty between the Hunters and the Stone Hammer Tribe. However, there still seems to be some commotion going on to the northwest of the Stone Hammer Tribe's lands. Maybe the war is not completely over yet.

Investigate the Northern Route of the Stone Hammer Tribe.|
12245|#&7$Young Hunter##br#
"Who are you? Judging from your outfit, you're not a hunter..."#br##br#
#&53$The young hunter looks at you curiously.##npc$Young Hunter$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain that the war between the Humans and Giants is finally over. Tanner has formed a treaty of peace with the Giants and has returned to the village to let everyone know.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Juno##br#
"Oh...you know Tanner? I'm Juno..."#br##br#
#&53$Juno looks suspicious and turns to Roger.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"Hey, Roger!"#npc$$821$1#|
12251|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Roger all about what has transpired in the Mountain Village, the Hunting Ground, and the Stone Hammer Tribe. The group led by his brother, Tanner, has just recently completed peace talks with the Stone Hammer Giants.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"Really?...Finally...it's over...My own little brother...I'm so proud!"#br##br#
#&53$Roger smiles serenely and gazes off down the mountain.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"As for me, well, I wasn't so lucky, obviously...I was so focused on our retreat from the Beast Statue Altar that I got careless. In that brief moment, the so-called Argus managed to strike a terrible blow."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After listening to Roger's tale, you ask if there's anything you can do to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"I would certainly not turn down the help of someone so trusted by my little brother. We are surrounded by Carnivorous Toucants in this area. Juno here is just a rookie hunter, I'm afraid he can't handle much more than a single Toucant, much less a carnivorous one."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"If you really want to help, please scare off those ferocious Carnivorous Toucants. It's dangerous in my condition to be surrounded by meat-eating birds...I'd really appreciate being able to lower my guard for a moment."#npc$$821$1#|
12252|#&7$Roger##br#
"Carnivorous Toucants always hunt in flocks. Even experienced hunters have to be careful when handling a group of these ferocious birds. You must be very careful or they will outsmart you."#npc$$821$1#|
12253|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Roger that you've taken care of the Carnivorous Toucant problem.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"Thank you, %n%, now I can finally relax, if even for just a moment. If you hadn't come along, it's quite possible that I would have already been a meal for them!"#npc$$821$1#|
12254|Some ferocious meat-eating toucants have been keeping a watchful eye on Roger. You must find a way to drive them off.

Chase off the Carnivorous Toucants and Swift Toucants near the Northern Route of the Stone Hammer Tribe.|
12261|#&7$Juno##br#
#&53$Juno, looking very anxious, stares towards the trail without a word. He looks like he's afraid of what he might see walking along the road...##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You question Juno, trying to find out what the matter is. Juno, embarrassed, struggles to answer.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Juno##br#
"I've been wanting to get some Toucant feathers to keep Roger warm, and I don't think I'd have any trouble doing so on my own..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"But...this forest is haunted! I'm too afraid to move from this spot... Supernatural things are too scary."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Concerned, you follow Juno's gaze down to the end of the trail, but see nothing at all.##char$$823:0$0##&PP00703#

#&7$Juno##br#
"I mean it, it really is haunted! While I was making a retreat earlier, I saw a translucent ghost drift right up in front of me! I'm not lying! I swear!"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"Sigh, nobody ever believes me...It's true, I am a coward, but...I still wish I could go get some of the Toucant's thick fluff for Roger..."#br##br#
#&53$Juno really does look quite scared.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After seeing how scared Juno is, but how much he wants to help, you make up your mind to go get those feathers for Roger, even if the forest is haunted.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Juno##br#
"Really? You'd do that for us? That's great! I can't even make myself take a single step into that haunted forest..."#npc$$828$1#|
12262|#&7$Juno##br#
"There really are ghosts around here...I wanna go hooome!"#npc$$829$1#|
12263|#&7$Juno##br#
"You're...you're still you, right? %n%? You're not possessed o...or a ghost...right?"#br##br#
#&53$Juno is still on alert, even while accepting the fluffy feathers you've brought.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
#&53$Juno lowers his guard, but still glances around cautiously. You do your best to reassure him that you are, in fact, you!##npc$$821$1#|
12264|Juno is too scared to go into the forest, but he's also scared that Roger's condition will worsen due to the heavy bleeding. After expressing his worries about a haunted forest, you decide to take charge and collect the Thick Fluff that Toucants are notorious for having.

Hunt Swift Toucants along the Stone Hammer Tribe's Northern Route and bring back their Thick Fluff.|
12271|#&7$Juno##br#
"I'm so lucky that you've come along. I was at a loss trying to figure out what to do next! I can't just leave Roger alone, hungry and cold..."#br##br#
#&53$Juno looks a little embarrassed.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"Even though the village isn't too far away, I don't think Roger can make it in his condition. He needs to recover a bit more before we try to make our way back home."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"I'd like to get some firewood to keep us warm... but..."#br##br#
#&53$Juno looks at you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"I'm embarrassing myself again, but...could you get us some firewood?"#npc$$821$1#|
12272|#&7$Juno##br#
"I have to get tougher! I can't just rely on %n% for everything..."#br##br#
#&53$Juno mumbles to himself.##npc$$821$1#|
12273|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Juno all the dry twigs you could find.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Juno##br#
#&53$Juno sets them on the ground and quickly has a fire started.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"%n%, why not rest by the fire with us? You've already done so much to help. I'm sure Roger would love to talk to you if you can spare the time, he's been really worrying about everything that's been going on lately."#npc$$821$1#|
12274|Juno would like to make a fire to keep warm by, so he's asked you to collect some firewood for him.

Follow along the Stone Hammer Tribe's Northern Route and collect Dry Twigs for Juno's fire.|
12281|#&7$Roger##br#
"I really admire your courage, %n%. Coming out here alone, fighting a war that you really didn't need to..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Roger if he knows anything about the ghost Juno is afraid of.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"A ghost? Oh, he must be talking about... Arghh...!"#br##br#
#&53$Roger clutched at the wound in his abdomen in pain. Trembling and dripping sweat, Roger looks like he can hardly keep it together.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You gently lay a hand on Roger's shoulder and ask him what, if anything, you can do to help.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"%n%, Highland Mollusks... Ughh... Somewhere to the northwest of the forest there is a creature called the Highland Mollusk..."#br##br#
#&53$Roger cringes in pain as he tries to talk.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"The... The mucus of the mollusk has a pain-killing effect. It would help relieve some of this pain... Can... can you get it for me?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"Please... hurry... I feel I may go mad from this pain..."#npc$$828$1#|
12282|#&7$Roger##br#
"Ohh..."#br##br#
#&53$Roger is dripping sweat...Every moment seems to be a struggle for him. You can tell he's trying to keep quiet as to not attract attention from any roving beasts.##npc$$828$1#|
12283|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly give Roger the Cold Mucus and watch as he silently applies it to his wound without a word.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"...Thank you, %n%."#br#
#&53$After a few minutes, Roger seems much more relaxed. The pain-killing effect of the mucus must have already begun to work.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"This wound is very serious. Even though it has received the best treatment to be expected out in the wild, it definitely needs to be taken care of by a doctor."#br##br#
#&53$%p% inspects Roger's injury, administering basic first aid.##pet$$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"Haha, my wound's dressing was done by Juno; pretty good for a rookie on such a serious injury. If only he could get over this mental barrier of fear, he'd become an excellent hunter someday."#br##br#
#&53$Roger looks over to see Juno staring into the dark forest.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"As for this ghost Juno mentioned, we first heard about it back in the village. Supposedly a child saw a female ghost near the forest edge, floating in the air..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"While we were retreating from the Beast Statue Altar I also saw this female ghost...I thought it was just because I was dizzy with pain, but if Juno saw her too..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Roger##br#
"Well, even if we did see a female figure, there's no reason to believe she is a ghost! During all that chaos, our imaginations could have run wild. Other than that, I have no clear answer for this."#npc$$821$1#|
12284|Roger is in an incredible amount of pain from his wounds and can hardly stand it any longer. He manages to tell you, through gritted teeth, that the mucus of the Highland Mollusk has pain-relieving properties.

12291|#&7$Roger##br#
"Juno, I think I'm feeling well enough to travel. While my pain is not too bad, let's try to head back to the village quickly."#br##br#
#&53$Roger, still under the pain-numbing effects of the Cold Mucus, seems to feel ready to return.##M126060$Roger$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"But, Roger! You can barely even walk right now. The path home is crawling with ferocious Dimetrodons, there's no way we can make it back in one piece! And there's also the..."#br##br#
#&53$Juno looks nervously in the direction of the dark forest.##M122070$Juno$821$0#

#&7$Roger##br#
"Have you so quickly forgotten our partner here?"#br##br#
#&53$Roger smiles at you.##br##br#
"%n% can go on ahead and make the way safe for us. I'm not worried in the slightest!"#M126060$Roger$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod to Roger and tell Juno that it'll be no problem for you to clear the Dimetrodons out of the way.##char$$806:0$0#

"We're ready whenever you are, %n%. Just say the word and we'll hit the road."#M126060$Roger$821$1#|
12292|#&7$Maya##br#
"Mmm, looks like another stranger is coming my way again. What's that? You know these people? Speak, or do you wish to face the wrath of Left-Wing Butterfly Maya?"#br#
#&53$At her feet, Avians lay on the ground dying.##npc$$825$1#|
12293|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A bewitching figure gracefully floats in the air before you. Is this the ghost Juno and Roger had seen? She slowly descends to the ground.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Oh, I know! You're the one poking around Deep's Cavern. Has your quest brought you to me?" #br##br#
#&53$Maya smiles at looks directly at you, her eyes piercing into the depths of your soul.##npc$$821$1#

12294|Despite Juno's protests, Roger insists that he wants to return to the village while his pain is still under control. The route back to town is dangerous, so you offer to clear away all the aggressive beasts along the northern path. When the coast is clear, Juno will help Roger get back to town.

Drive off all the Mountain Dimetrodons along the northern path so that Juno and Roger can safely return to the village.|
12301|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You boldly approach this mysterious woman and ask what she knows about the barrier spell cast upon the entrance to Deep's Cavern.##char$$821$0#

"So it's true! You are the one who's been poking around there. It's a fairly simple spell to break, not an issue for someone like me at all." #br##br#

#&53$Completely taken by surprise, you realize that this Eidolon is the 'ghost' you fought earlier. You brace yourself, ready for a fight...##char$$827:80$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Relaaaax. I don't intend to fight you for no good reason. Perhaps we can work together, yes? I've been having a bit of an...issue with these Avians, as you can see. I'll be in a very, very bad mood until it gets resolved..."#M130010$Maya$828$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"These filthy birds snuck in while I was otherwise occupied and made off with my magic equipment. I tried to simply ask them where they took it...but they didn't cooperate! Dirty, smelly Avians!"#M130010$Maya$826$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Let's make a deal, shall we? Envoy to Envoy? I don't want to be around these filthy birds any longer, so if you could retrieve my equipment, I'll return the favor by dispelling the barrier blocking the entrance to Deep's Cave. Sounds fair? I certainly think so!"#M130010$Maya$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly think it over and then nod in agreement. Even though you hardly know a thing about this other Envoy, you were going to have to deal with the Avians eventually. Perhaps helping each other will save some time, if she really can so easily break the barrier.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Excellent! Oh, and one more thing. I want these Avians to suffer for what they've done to me...hehehe! You'll make sure of that, right?"#M130010$Maya$825$1#|
12302|#&7$Maya##br#
"If you won't help me, I see no reason to waste my time on you. Understand?"#br##br#

#&53$After having defeated many of the Argus Disciples, you return to Maya with the news.##char$$821$0#

"Excellent! The faster you do as I say, the faster we can leave this filthy place. Now that you've shown those Avians the wrath of Maya, it's time to sneak into their stupid Avian lair."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Don't worry, don't worry! I'll keep my promise. I always keep my promises..."#npc$$827$1#|
12304|Maya, the mysterious Envoy of Gaia who has lately been mistaken for a ghost, seems to somehow know that you seek to break the barrier over Deep's Cavern. She agrees to help you out, as long as you help her exact revenge upon the Avians who stole her magic equipment first.

Teach the Argus Guards a lesson from Maya.|
12311|#&7$Maya##br#
"It is true that it is sooo easy to break the magic barrier cast on Deep's Cavern, but I still need your help. You can't expect me to do everything on my own, right?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Uncertain of whether or not Maya is simply trying to use you, you have already agreed to help, so you tell her you will do what you can to assist.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"First of all, you were indeed right. The Avians are the ones you created that annoying barrier. But the Avians can't create such a spell like that without also having a Magic Circle somewhere else, you see? If that circle is broken, the barrier will be drastically weakened and easy to dispel."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"As stupid and filthy as they are, the Avians are not complete idiots...This critical Magic Circle will definitely be safely situated in their village."#br##br#
#&53$Maya looks with fury in the direction of the Avian's home.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"I'll leave it up to you to get in there and destroy the Magic Circle. I can't stand to be around those dirty, smelly birdmen! I feel like I need to take a bath from just thinking about them, ugh!" #npc$$827$1#|
12312|#&7$Maya##br#
"I guess if you don't want to help, you can try to find someone else...Oh, wait! I'm the only one around who can actually help, aren't I? Hehe!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Get out there and destroy that Magic Circle, I'm counting on you!" #npc$$825$1#|
12313|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Maya that the Magic Circle is destroyed, and she smiles widely.##char$$824:0$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Perfect! I'm so glad; that annoying Magic Circle is finally out of the picture..." #br##br#
#&53$Maya suddenly stops smiling and stares at you seriously. It's actually quite creepy...##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Hmm... Your strength is quite surprising, even for an Envoy of Gaia. Well, no need to make a fuss, I guess. Don't look at me like that, it's only an observation." #npc$$826$1#|
12314|Maya tells you that in order to weaken the barrier blocking the entrance to Deep's Cavern, a special Magic Circle created by the Avians must be destroyed.

Enter the Argus Cult and destroy the Cursed Argus Circle.|

"You certainly move quickly! With this pace, we'll be able to break through the barrier in no time."#br##br#
#&53$Maya smiles strangely, but seems to genuinely want to help you out... you think.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"To fully break this magic spell, we'll have to find the one who cast it. That sort of thing is common knowledge, right? However... After all the commotion in the village, the guards are certainly going to be keeping their acolytes safe.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"If this is the case, you must terminate all the guards and sorcerers getting in our way. Then we'll be able to proceed with our plan."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Remembering that Maya said this would be "easy," you frown slightly at the many tasks Maya has assigned you.##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Hmm...? What are you waiting for? Do you think killing the guards and sorcerers is not enough? Well, I guess you can take down more, if you like! Hehe!"#npc$$826$1#|
12322|#&7$Maya##br#
"Stop dawdling, there is much to do! I don't have time to wait on you forever!" #br##br#
#&53$Maya looks supremely unhappy to see you still lingering around.##npc$$826$1#|
12323|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Maya that you've taken out the majority of the guards and sorcerers of the Argus Cult.##char$$821$0#

"Perfect...now the entire Avian village has lost all its defenses...All that's left is to locate Zujahla. He is the one who cast the barrier spell."#M130010$Maya$825$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Zujahla is the deacon of the Argus Cult. Wait here, I'll cast a location spell that will reveal him to us."#M130010$Maya$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
#&53$Maya mumbles strange words as she casts the location spell.##M130010$Maya$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$So, according to Maya, this Zujahla is the one who cast the barrier spell. If she is correct, and he is found, the spell will soon be broken!##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Hmph! Come out Zujahla, don't even think you can hide from me...!#M130010$Maya$311$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"That's him! I see him!"#br##br#
#&53$Maya shouts viciously, a confident smile spreading across her face.##M130010$Maya$2012$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Wait...What's happening? Zujahla's aura...it disappeared! No! I was so close, so close to seeing where he is hiding!!"#M130010$Maya$823$1#|
12324|The Argus Cult has raised the alarm and established a watch over the important members of the village. You must quickly strike before the Avians have fully established a solid defense!

Defeat Argus Guards and Argus Sorcerers at the Argus Cult.|
12331|#&7$Maya##br#
"Ugh! I don't have time for this! Those stupid, filthy Argus Sorcerers must be on to us - they know we're after Zujahla. They must be uniting their strength to keep him hidden from my Sight."#br##br#
#&53$Maya looks furious.##M130010$Maya$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Maya how she would like to proceed.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"%n%, I know you've already taken out a lot of Argus Cult members today, but you're just going to have to head back in and fight some more. I need those Argus Sorcerers taken out of the picture, otherwise they'll just keep Zujahla's location concealed."#M130010$Maya$826$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"I don't think I have to remind you that the Sorcerers will certainly be under the protection of some Argus Gladiators. They may seem stinky and goofy looking, but don't underestimate them! Understand?"#M130010$Maya$826$1#|
12332|#&7$Maya##br#
"Curse you stupid, ugly, stinky birds! You think you're so smart, huh?! I'll never forgive you!"#br##br#
#&53$Maya stares furiously towards the Avian Village.##M130010$Maya$826$1#|
12333|#&7$Maya##br#
"Have you taken care of those awful Sorcerers yet? I can't believe I wasted so much of my magic on that tracking spell only to be thwarted by Avians! Those birds will pay!"#br##br#
#&53$Maya looks very displeased.##M130010$Maya$823$1#|
12334|While trying to locate the Argus Deacon Zujahla with her magic, Maya's tracking spell was suddenly interrupted. She is certain that the Argus Sorcerers, guarded by Argus Gladiators, are pooling their magic to block Maya's spell.

Defeat the Argus Sorcerers and their Argus Gladiator guardians so that Maya can locate Zujahla and the barrier over Deep's Cavern can be lifted.|
12341|#&7$Maya##br#
"Ugh! Why is all this taking so long?! At this rate, I'll run out of my magic power really soon. You must get me something to help me replenish what I'm losing."#M130010$Maya$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Hmm, the staves from those dying sorcerers should do nicely. I should definitely be able to absorb whatever remaining magics reside within..."#M130010$Maya$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"I've gotta say, that young soldier girl from earlier - obviously a beginner with magic - was the one to give me this idea. Absorbing the magic essence from the Rock Beetles was good thinking. I don't normally have to do this sort of thing, of course, but I'm glad you guys thought of it." #M130010$Maya$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your gaze off into the distance as you think about what Maya has said. How did she know what happened earlier outside of Deep's Cavern? Was Maya there? Or did she use some kind of magic to oversee from afar...?##char$$828:0$0#

"What are you just standing there for! This is why I am running out of magic! Get. Me. The. Staff!!!" #M130010$Maya$826$1#

"Master, is everything alright? This woman is acting really weird..." #pet$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Even though you, too, are suspicious of Maya's intent, it does seem like she really wants to take down the barrier. For the moment you have no better idea, so you decide to go along with Maya's plan.##char$$821$0#|
12342|#&7$Maya##br#
"I didn't think that maintaining this spell could drain so much of my power..."#br##br#
#&53$Maya seems to be talking to herself and doesn't even notice you.##npc$$828$1#|
12343|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You collect the Argus Curse Staffs and gave them to Maya.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
#&53$Maya absorbs them into her body, smiling as her magic gradually returns.##npc$$2012$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"It seems I've almost been fully restored, sweetie. I guess I should thank you for giving me this idea."#npc$$824$1#|
12344|Maya complains that she doesn't have enough magical power left to cast even a simple tracking spell. However, she has an idea: she could use some magic staffs to replenish her powers. 

Find the Argus Warlocks in the Avian Fort and take their Argus Curse Staffs.|
12351|#&7$Maya##br#
"This part should be easy!"#br##br#
#&53$Maya giggles.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
#&53$An orb of light appears with a gesture of her hand.##br##br#
"This magic ball will guide you to the source of the magic. At least I'm pretty sure it will."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Don't worry, I'm pretty sure it'll help you find Zujahla. Now listen carefully."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"You need to find Zujahla's Argus Ritual Codex. That'll have the spells for the barrier in it. With it, I'll be able to take the barrier down."#npc$$827$1#|
12352|#&7$Maya##br#
"You want the barrier destroyed, don't you? Then get out there and find Zujahla! If you don't get that book, that barrier is staying up!"#npc$$826$1#|
12353|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Argus Ritual Codex over. Maya flips quickly through the pages, scanning the text.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"What the... this is a bunch of useless junk! Where are the spells? The magical incantations?"#br##br#
#&53$Maya seems quite upset.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Sigh. I guess there is some useful reference material..."#br##br#
#&53$Maya appears to be disappointed... until she realizes you're staring at her.##npc$$828$1#|
12354|Maya has made a magic orb for you. If you take it to the Avian Fort, it will reveal any invisible targets. This will let you find Zujahla and the Argus Ritual Codex.

"Most mages can't handle the Magic Barrier since the art has been lost. Lucky for you, lost arts are my specialty."#br##br#
#&53$Maya's expression changes from one of fury to a broad smile.##M130010$Maya$825$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Let me take a look at that book."#br##br#
#&53$Maya flips through the Argus Ritual Codex.##M130010$Maya$828$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Even easier than I thought!"#br##br#
#&53$Maya turns; you feel a rush of air and a rumbling in the earth.##M130010$Maya$2012$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"And done. The barrier sealing Deep's Cavern is gone. Now, I've kept up my end of the deal, right?"#M130010$Maya$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You look at Maya with suspicion. This all seemed a little too easy...##char$$823$0#

"%n%, I'm glad you came! This... this... witch is causing all sorts of problems! She almost ruined our plan by rushing in here!"#M125010$Robinson$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Hey, I couldn't let %n% forget our deal! You promised to bring me some magical equipment! That's why I got rid of the Magic Barrier for you!"#M130010$Maya$821$0#|
12363|#&7$Robinson##br#
"%n%, I'm glad you came! This strange lady here says you know her. She just barged in here, almost wrecking our plans!"#M125010$Robinson$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"%n%, don't you forget about the deal we made! You promised to bring me that magic equipment; it's the only reason why I helped you dismiss that magic barrier!"#M130010$Maya$821$0#

#&53$You tell Robinson about how Maya helped you as well as what happened with the Argus Cult.##char$$821$0#

"What she said was really true? You have my apologies, then."#br##br#
#&53$Robinson apologizes to Maya, bowing his head respectfully.##M125010$Robinson$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Oh, it's not a problem.  If it really bothered me, I would have turned you into a toad or something."#br##br#
#&53$The soldiers stare at Maya in disbelief.##M130010$Maya$826$0#|
12364|Maya claims that she's taken care of the barrier. You should go confirm it yourself.

"Walter told me that both the Cult Leader Zaunna and Argus are here. This is way beyond the Hunter's Group, so I brought in some help."#M125010$Robinson$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You agree that this would to be too much for them, and suggest they hold ground here and protect the area from attack.##char$$821$0#

"..."#br##br#
#&53$Robinson looks displeased.##M125010$Robinson$826$1#

"%n%'s right. The people inside are on another level. You'd be committing suicide if you rushed in."#M130010$Maya$827$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Just let %n% go alone. Everyone else will just get killed trying to protect you."#M130010$Maya$826$0#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Blast it..."#br##br#
#&53$Robinson snarls, glaring at Maya. He bites back whatever retort he has.##M125010$Robinson$826$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Fine... I get it. Still, if you need help, just shout. We'll come running regardless."#M125010$Robinson$821$1#|
12372|#&7$Maya##br#
"Heh heh heh!"#br##br#
#&53$Maya seems quite amused with herself.##npc$$825$1#|
12373|#&7$Maya##br#
"Yes! Finally! Ha ha ha! The Eye of Argus is mine!"#br##br#
#&53$Maya cannot contain continuous peals of laughter.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Something's definitely not right here. You ask Maya what is going on.##char$$821$0#|

"I held up my end of the bargain, right %n%?"#br##br#
#&53$Maya breaks into laughter again.##npc$$825$1#

"That's right! I created the barrier. That's why I knew I could remove it! I did this all for the Eye of Argus."#npc$$821$1#

"I knew it was you messing with us!"#br##br#
#&53$%p% assumes a combat stance.##pet$$1001$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"No need to be like that! I may have tricked you, but I did hold up my end of the bargain."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"I did you a favor by sealing the cave anyway. If it'd been open, you and that Hunter Village would have been crushed already."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"We both used each other. That's fair, no?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Anyway, it looks like the demons are starting to get worked up. And, of course, Argus is going to be a problem..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"With the barrier gone, nasty things are gonna start spilling out of that cave. If I were you, I'd get in there and clean it up before it gets out of hand."#npc$$825$1#|
12382|#&7$Dallan##br#
"Are you okay?"#br##br#
#&53$Dallan asks, his voice filled with concern.##npc$$821$1#|
12383|#&7$Dallan##br#
"Life in the Hunter Village is peaceful again, thanks to you. You should be proud."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"You've defeated the giants, stopped a war, and even ended a hidden threat."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan nods respectfully to you before turning to Robinson.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"And you too. You're both heroes."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"I didn't do anything worth praise."#br##br#
#&53$Robinson looks away.##M125010$Robinson$823$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
#&53$Dallan puts his hand on Robinson's shoulder.##br##br#
"If you hadn't guarded us, dozens of people would have been killed."#npc$$821$1#|
12384|It turns out that Maya is the one who created the Magic Barrier. Unfortunately, she duped you into getting her what she needed from the Argus Cult... But now isn't the time to worry about this. Argus is still lurking in that cave! 

Defeat the monsters within the cave!|

"What's going on? I rushed over here when I heard that loud noise!"#br##br##&53$Robinson gasps, trying to catch his breath.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"I guess in the end all we really can do is rely on you, %n%. We just aren't on your level. Tracking the Shadow Knight was the most we could do for you."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"I guess we should get back to the village. This place is going to be crawling with beasts soon."#npc$$821$1#|

"Leaving so soon, %n%? Why not stay and join the celebration?"#M008040$Kara$3001$1#

"I'm glad that you helped out that Hunter Village, took care of Argus before things got worse, and eliminated that monster."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"What's more, we learned something from all this. It seems that the Shadow Knight already knows how to use the Cube of Gaia to create monsters. The Mine Beetle in the Demarech Mines was simple. Argus, though, that shows some real expertise."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You can't help but feel a bit uneasy. The Cube of Gaia supposedly created the world and all of its creatures. If the Shadow Knight is able to control it completely...##br##br#

"I've seen you before, %n%, at Helonia. If it weren't for you, the pirates would be ruling it right now."#npc$$501$1#

#&53$Yolanda seems quite tired. You ask if she needs to sit down.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Yolanda##br#
"No, thank you. I'm fine. I've just been trying to learn about what happened to my husband."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Yolanda##br#
"Lucas was an ecologist who traveled all over the world. I don't know why he wanted to come out here, though."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Yolanda##br#
"I know everyone thinks a monster is responsible, but I doubt it. My husband knew how to deal with monsters. Someone else must have been responsible."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You note what Yolanda said, promising her you'll find out what happened to Lucas.##char$$822:75$0#

"If anyone can do it, you can. Please, find out what happened to my beloved husband."#npc$$829$1#|

"I only came out here to investigate the Corpser Bandits. I didn't think that the Shadow Knight would have been here already..."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You notice Alex's serious expression.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"As if the murders aren't enough. The entire marsh is changing! A lot of these animals are completely new to this area."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Take the Thousandwaters Marsh, for example. It used to be a quaint little marsh just east of here, but now it's filled with Carnivorous Crocodiles! We need to figure out what is happening."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask if there's anything you can do to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Of course! We have sent some of our best scholars to the marsh."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I want you to identify the Carnivorous Crocodile range. When you're done, give that info to Penny. Hopefully that will provide us some insight into matters."#npc$$821$1#|
12422|#&7$Penny##br#
"I just don't get it! Why would Carnivorous Crocodiles migrate out here?"#npc$$828$1#|
12423|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Penny all of the information you gathered. You then tell her that Alex asked you to come.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"This is the current active range of the Carnivorous Crocodiles? Let's have a look!"#br##br#
#&53$Penny bends over the notes, studying them intently.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"See, normally their territories are small and they defend them ruthlessly. This... this is something completely different."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"They must have been forced out of their homes somehow."#npc$$827$1#|
12424|Many Carnivorous Crocodiles have shown up east of the village. Alex wants you to study their range and pass that information along to Assistant Penny. 

Head to the northern part of Thousandwaters Marsh, record the locations of the Carnivorous Crocodiles, and give that information to Assistant Penny.|
12431|#&7$Penny##br#
"What a terrible situation. Even if they've been forced to migrate, they still have to be eliminated. We can't waste time trying to figure out why they've moved."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I'm sorry to say, but you're gonna have to handle it. You're a soldier. We're just scholars."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$That doesn't come as a surprise.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Be careful. They're dangerous enough in their native habitat. Being forced out of their home has made them even more aggressive."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"If you don't do something, they'll be attacking the village soon enough."#npc$$821$1#|
12432|#&7$Penny##br#
"These Carnivorous Crocodiles are quite dangerous. If they aren't taken care of, the villagers will be in real danger!"#npc$$821$1#|
12433|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Penny that the Carnivorous Crocodiles have been eliminated.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I guess it had to be done. Once we finish investigating, I hope we can help them repopulate their home. Now we can focus on investigating Lucas'..."#M106030$Penny$822$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
#&53$Penny is interrupted by Alex's arrival.##M137010$Alex$3001$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Penny, %n%, good that you're both here. Our patrols have found a number of bats southeast of the village."#M137010$Alex$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Bats? Could they belong to the Corpser Bandits? That's really close to where we found Lucas' body..."#br##br#
#&53$Penny seems lost in thought.##M106030$Penny$828$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"We were wondering the same thing. That's why I need %n% to investigate the matter. %n%, meet me later, we've got a lot to talk about."#M137010$Alex$822$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You promise to meet Alex later.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Could you maybe help me while you help Alex? I need some things collected for me too. I need to check my molds."#M106030$Penny$827$1#|
12434|The Carnivorous Crocodiles are a danger to the Villagers, so Penny asks you to eliminate them.

12441|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Penny what she needs.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Well, see, I've taken molds of the bites on Lucas' body. I just need to see if the bite marks belong to the bats."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"So, I was hoping you could bring me some bat teeth. I have a feeling they won't match my molds at all."#npc$$828$1#|
12442|#&7$Penny##br#
"Please bring me back some teeth from the bats. I need to compare them to my molds."#npc$$821$1#|
12443|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the teeth over to Penny.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I...didn't need quite that many..."#npc$$825$1#|
12444|Penny doubts that Lucas' death has something to do with the bats, so she asks you to collect bat teeth for her to examine.

12451|#&7$Alex##br#
"Hm. We should make sure bats were present at the scene. Could you collect some soil samples for me? It hasn't rained, so there should still be traces of the bats in the soil."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask what you need to do.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Well, %n%, just collect some soil samples. Go grab some dirt. Oh, and if you get a chance, take care of some bats too."#npc$$822$1#|
12452|#&7$Alex##br#
"Hurry and collect some soil from the scene. We need to confirm the cause of Lucas' death."#npc$$821$1#|
12453|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Alex the soil you retrieved. You also inform him that you took care of the bats.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"You're really good at this, you know? Would you like to join the Investigation Team one day?"#br##br#
#&53$Alex smiles.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I wish I could recommend you, but that would be a bad idea. They'd deny you on the spot."#npc$$821$1#

"Uh... why would they do that? Aren't you important?"#br##br#
#&53$%p% looks at Alex curiously.##pet$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"We just don't get along that well. We've had our little problems in the past. They'd assume I'd want to hire someone just like me!"#br##br#
#&53$Alex laughs without a care.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Oh! I almost forgot! Have you talked to Penny? She's been working on the Carnivorous Crocodile report. She'd probably love to talk to you."#npc$$821$1#|
12454|Alex asks you to survey the southern Thousandwaters Marsh, take some soil samples, and eliminate any bats in the area.

"%n%, do you remember the Carnivorous Crocodile invasion?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod. How could you forget fighting those things?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I found where this particular group originated from: north of Candetonn! They'd never crossed the river before this, let alone attacked villagers."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Penny what could have made them move.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"That's what I need your help investigating. The most probable cause is an environmental change."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Please investigate their old habitat. Oh, and be careful! If it isn't something environmental, it is probably REALLY dangerous."#npc$$827$1#|
12462|#&7$Penny##br#
"The Carnivorous Crocodiles are from the north. Can you go find out what's changed up there?"#npc$$821$1#|
12463|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Penny that the place is swarming with hostile Arachnids!##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"That's not possible!"#br##br#
#&53$Penny frantically flips through her paperwork.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"There are no records of Arachnids anywhere near here! Something is definitely wrong."#npc$$821$1#|
12464|Penny asks you to head north and examine what has changed in the former Carnivorous Crocodile habitat.

"My analysis of the bat teeth is progressing, but I have some spare time."#br##br#
#&53$Penny grins.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"We need to know more about these Arachnids to figure out why they're here."#br##br#
#&53$Penny hands you an Insect Trap Box.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"This box can hold any bug. So, get out there and bring me back a live one, please."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take the box, a feeling of dread weighing down on you.##char$$809:80$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, those bugs were pretty fierce. You'll have to subdue them if you want to catch them."#br##br#
#&53$%p% seems a little worried.##pet$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Just don't 'subdue' them too hard! I need them alive to make sure I can properly identify them." #npc$$824$1#|
12472|#&7$Penny##br#
"Please bring that Arachnic back alive! If you can manage that, I'll identify what kind it is."#npc$$821$1#|

"Whoa! That's a scary one! #br#
I never knew that there would be bugs like this in Candeo Marsh. #br#
I'm pretty sure this one isn't native to the marsh." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Penny##br# 
"I'll start the identification process immediately." #br#
Penny looks intently at the Arachnid, #br#
her passion for her work self-evident. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br# 
"By the way, while you were out catching bugs, #br#
the results of the tests we were running came in." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask if any evidence was discovered in the collected soil #br#
that might be have to do with Lucas. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br# 
"Not really. The evidence in the soil has nothing to do with Lucas. #br#
I don't think we're dealing with a murder scene in this case. #br#
However, when we tested the tooth mold, #br#
we discovered traces of Turtle blood." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Penny##br# 
"You should go talk to Alex about it." #npc$$821$1#|

"Interesting, isn't it? Those turtles live in Fernscall Woods. I've already sent some knights to investigate."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I'm 100% sure those bats aren't wild. Turtles aren't normal prey for them. Someone probably trained those bats to kill using the turtles."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$Things are starting to make sense...##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Alex##br#

"Oh... %n%? I'm glad they sent more help."#npc$$828$1#|
12484|The investigation shows that the blood left on the bat teeth is from a type of turtle that lives in the Eastern Fernscall Woods. Alex asks you to head out there and meet with the soldiers he sent to investigate.

"Sorry, %n%. I'm a little on edge right now."#br##br#
#&53$Mark looks like he wants to say something more.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Mark to relax and tell you what happened.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mark##br#
"Alex is right. Normally the bats would ignore the turtles. When we got here, though, there were turtle husks everywhere. We couldn't find a drop of blood between them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mark##br#
"The investigation has sort of stalled, though. See, we thought these turtles were docile creatures."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mark##br#
"Given they attack us the instant we set foot in the marsh, we're pretty sure that's wrong."#br##br#
#&53$Mark shakes his head in annoyance.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Mark that you'll distract the turtles so they can work.##char$$806:0$0#

"It is embarrassing to say, but the turtles have us surrounded. Chase them off, would you?" #npc$$821$1#|
12493|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Mark that you cleared the turtles out.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mark##br#
"Thanks, %n%. While you handled that, we found something on our own. Someone tried to clean them up, but there are definitely footprints here."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mark##br#
"I have to admit, even with the turtles pushed back, I'm still kinda worried! I can feel someone out there, watching us..."#npc$$821$1#|
12494|Mark has found several turtle corpses, all completely drained of blood. Unfortunately, the live ones are pretty mean. He needs you to take care of them.

#&7$Henry##br#
"Hopefully this is enough for our purposes."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Henry##br#
"So, based on our observations, the turtles are used to train the bats. Based on the footprints and all the guano around here, this is probably a popular place for them to train."#npc$$821$1#

"Well, I didn't expect to meet another Envoy of Gaia out here!"#br##br#
#&53$A woman dressed in white appears in front of you.##M131010$Maiden in White$52$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Startled, you demand that she identifies herself. You ask if she has anything to do with the Corpser Bandits.##char$$803:79$0#

#&7$Maiden in White##br#
"Don't be so worried, I'm fighting them too! Also, quiet down, please. Even together, I don't think we could handle ALL of the Corpsers."#M131010$Maiden in White$823$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"My name is Mia. Gotta say, eliminating those bats really shows your skill. What do you think of teaming up, eh?"#br##br#
#&53$Mia offers a friendly smile.##M131010$Mia$822$1#

"I know you want to slaughter bandits, but you don't know the half of it. Their group is massive these days. Taking care of them by yourself won't be easy."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"If you'd like to help me, though, I could help you. It is a good deal, so I recommend you think about it."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&53$You consider Mia's offer. You look to %p% for a second opinion.##char$$826$0#

#&53$You nod and agree to work with Mia.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"I'm looking forward to it! Before we get started, we need to take care of a little problem though."#M131010$Mia$822$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"I HAD cast a spell to conceal myself, but you forced me to undo it. Now those blasted Wolfmen know I'm here."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Please find the Corpser Watchers and take care of them. We can't risk them reporting our presence."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12542|#&7$Mia##br#
"If we don't hurry, the watchers are going to alert the camp. I'd rather not have the entirety of the Corpser Bandits hunting us."#npc$$821$1#|
12543|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report back to Mia on your progress.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Good! Now we can really get to work!"#npc$$821$1#|
12544|Mia has been detected already! She needs you to eliminate the people looking for her. 

Eliminate the Corpser Watchers outside the Corpser Camp.|
12551|#&7$Mia##br#
"As you can see, the Corpser Bandit Camp isn't far from here. Now we just need to start taking out their defenses. We'll strip them down, layer by layer, until we can strike at their heart."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Our first step is to get rid of the bats. I know you've taken care of a lot of them already! The problem is that a lot are still at the camp. Of course, even if you slaughter all those, it would be nothing to train new ones."#M131010$Mia$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Mia what she thinks should be done.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Take out the ones who control the bats: the Corpser Beast Trainers!"#br##br#
#&53$Mia smiles.##M131010$Mia$825$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Oh, you also need to take their Corpser Training Whistles. If we don't get those, they'll just train more... uh... trainers."#npc$$821$1#|
12552|#&7$Mia##br#
"Go defeat Corpser Beast Trainers as quick as you can. Oh, and don't forget to take their whistles!"#npc$$821$1#|
12553|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Mia all the whistles you collected.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Great work! That's one obstacle out of the way! I'll keep these, since I've got a plan for them."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Mia seems to know a lot about the Corpser Bandits... You ask her if she know anything about the Shadow Knight.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Well, I've scouted physically and magically, but nothing turned up like this Shadow Knight you're looking for."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12554|Mia needs the whistles from the Corpser Beast Trainers if the bat threat is going to be eliminated. 

Eliminate the Corpser Beast Trainers near the Corpser Bandit Camp and take the Corpser Training Whistles.|
12561|#&7$Mia##br#
"Ugh, I think those bandits know something is up. The Corpser Camp has tightened its security. They've even erected defense totems!"#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"These totems fortify their skills and protect them from magic. If the totems are up, I'm not going to be much help."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You say you'll take care of it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"No, not yet. We need to weaken them first. There are still quite a few Corpser Warriors guarding the gate. No way you'd get to the totems while they're alive."#M131010$Mia$823$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Oh! And while you're at it, could you bring me their weapons, armor, and a bit of hair? You get me enough of that, I'll supply the plan."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12562|#&7$Mia##br#
"Get me weapons, armor, and hair from the Corpser Warriors. After that, I think we'll be able to handle the totems."#npc$$821$1#|
12563|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Mia everything you've collected and ask why she needs the stuff.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"A disguise, of course! What were you expecting, a curse or something? Anyway, with a disguise, it would be possible to sneak into the camp."#M131010$Mia$825$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"My spell will transform you into a Wolfman. The armor and weapons you have will do the rest."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12564|The Corpser Bandits have noticed that enemies are in the area, and, as a result, have fortified their defenses. Mia asks you to defeat Corpser Warriors near their gate then collect their weapons, armor, and hair from the fallen.

12571|#&7$Mia##br#
"Are you ready?"#M131010$Mia$1001$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
#&53$Mia smiles as she begins casting her spell. The air crackles around you as she speaks.##M131010$Mia$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're surprised as your feet leave the ground; it isn't at all frightening or uncomfortable.##char$$601$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
#&53$Mia completes her spell; you drop gently to the ground.##M131010$Mia$2011$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You don't feel any different. You express your doubts to Mia.##M055020$%n%$52$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you speak, you realize that you've changed! Your voice has deepened, a hoarse edge to the sound. This unnerves you.##M055020$%n%$2012$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Well, that looks pretty... good. No one will suspect you at all."#br##br#
#&53$Mia looks away, trying to stifle her laughter.##M131010$Mia$825$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Now you just need to sneak into their camp and take the totem down. Oh, and bring it back to me when you're finished."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12572|#&7$Mia##br#
"Hurry up and destroy that Totem! Oh, and bring back whatever's left of it when you're done."#npc$$821$1#|
12573|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$While transformed, you manage to destroy to the totems.##M055020$%n%$1$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Let me see if this is what I need."#br##br#
#&53$Mia scrutinizes the totem.##M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Oh bother and blast! None of these are the Corpser Totem!"#M131010$Mia$828$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Whatever, I'm sure they have it somewhere. As long as I help you, it'll end up with me sooner or later."#M131010$Mia$825$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Let's get you changed back now."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12574|Mia transforms you into a Corpser Warrior so you can infiltrate the Corpser Camp, take the totems down, and bring them back to her. 

Get to work!|
12581|#&7$Mia##br#
"Okay. Let's get down to business. We need to handle the bats."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"First thing's first, we need to learn about those bloodsuckers."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Stir the bats up by attacking them. Things reveal their weaknesses when they're stirred up."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12582|#&7$Mia##br#
"Head to the north of the camp, attack the bats, and cause a commotion."#npc$$821$1#|
12583|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You disturbed the bats, so now they're flitting around the camp anxiously.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Excellent. Those bats are making a mess! So, I've put some thought into it. Animals that are scared are much easier to control using magic."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12584|Mia asks you to attack bats in the camp to rile them up. 

Attack the Vampire Bats in the Corpser Camp.|
12591|#&7$Mia##br#
"We should use this opportunity to capture some bats."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask her how she expects you to capture them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Remember those whistles I had you get? The bandits use those to control the bats!"#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"We're gonna beat them at their own game."#M131010$Mia$825$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Take a Cloth Bag with you and capture some of the bats. With some time, I'll be able to have them attacking the camp."#npc$$821$1#|
12592|#&7$Mia##br#
"Capture some bats and bring them to me. I'll work out how to send them back to play."#npc$$821$1#|
12593|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You wrestle the captured bats over to Mia.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"These poor little bats. What they've been through... There is no way we'll be able to release them into the wild."#M131010$Mia$828$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
#&53$Mia takes the whistle and plays several notes. The bag quiets down almost instantly.##M131010$Mia$1001$1#|
12594|Mia wants to use the whistles you collected to control the Vampire Bats so she can strike back with them. So, she asks you to capture some of them. 

Use the Cloth Bag to capture the Corpser Vampire Bats when they are weak.|
12601|#&7$Mia##br#
"The whistle works pretty well, but, as a precaution, I've also used a sleep spell. This will make sure that the bats can't turn against us."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're pretty sure the templars won't agree to this, but it is a good plan.##char$$828:80$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Now you just need to drop the bats off by the Corpser Camp gate."#br##br#
#&53$Mia hands the bag to you.##M131010$Mia$822$1#|
12602|#&7$Mia##br#
"Release those bats near the camp. Once you've done that, just come back to me."#npc$$821$1#|
12603|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You release the bats and then return to Mia.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Great. The bats will trigger soon and then we can watch what happens. This is going to be great."#npc$$821$1#|
12604|Mia wants you to go to the Corpser Camp and release the captured bats so they can attack the camp. 

Go to the gate of the camp and release the bats.|
12611|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Mia what she's going to do with the bats.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"I just asked the bats to recruit their friends and have some fun. We're gonna have a full blown bat army in no time!"#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You worry that the bats will still be a threat after they finish at the camp.##char$$826:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"You are thinking very clearly, and that's why I've also given another order to the bats. Once they finish, I've commanded them to kill themselves."#M131010$Mia$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Woah. Will that plan even work?##char$$823:72$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Don't believe me? Well, how about I show you? Don't give me that look. I'll just let you... Hitch a ride to the party."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"What do you think? Want to go?"#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&53$*If you accept this quest, you will take control of a bat, then take part in the attack.#|
12612|#&7$Mia##br#
"The attack has started! Let's wait it out."#npc$$821$1#|
12613|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Mia that her spell worked perfectly.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"It looks like the bats have done their part. That camp is a mess! All we have to do is wipe the stragglers out."#npc$$821$1#|
12614|Mia's plan is to let the bats enter the camp, go on a rampage, and then kill themselves. 

Force the bat to kill itself by flying into the fire after annihilating the enemy.|
12621|#&7$Mia##br#
"And we're done."#M131010$Mia$828$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"The bandits are either dead or scattered. Either way, I think the bats won."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"%n%, I think it is time for you and %p% to work. Break into the camp and take care of the remaining Corpser Bandits and Killers."#M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12622|#&7$Mia##br#
"Finish off the remaining Corpser Bandits and Killers!"#npc$$821$1#|
12623|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Mia that you completed the task.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Well, we've killed pretty much every Corpser around here, but I still haven't found the totem I was looking for. Guess it must be with their leader."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask about the totem that Mia needs.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"My sister and I both have missions we have to complete. Mine is to steal the Corpser Totem from the Corpser Bandits."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Sorry, but I can't reveal more."#M131010$Mia$828$1#|
12624|Mia asks you to finish off the Corpser Bandits. 

Go to the Corpser Camp and eliminate Corpser Bandits and Killers.|
12631|#&7$Mia##br#
"We're almost done!"#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"If we can take care of the Corpser Bandit Chief, the Corpser Bandits will fall completely apart."#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You do your best to hide your disappointment; you had hoped to find something out about the Shadow Knight. Still, you agree to see this to the end.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Don't forget our agreement! The Corpser Bandit Chief probably has the totem I want. After you've dealt with him, search him! Thoroughly! If you find any totems, bring them right back to me!" #M131010$Mia$821$1#|
12632|#&7$Mia##br#
"The leader of the Corpser Bandits must have what I need! Defeat him and bring the totem I need back!"#npc$$821$1#|
12633|#&7$Mia##br#
"Well? Did you find it?"#M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Mia the totem that you found on the Corpser Bandit Chief.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"This is it! This is the Corpser Totem!"#br##br#
#&53$Mia beams with excitement. Looks like you found the right totem.##M131010$Mia$824$1#|
12634|The Corpser Bandit Chief is on his last legs. It is time to end this. 

Eliminate the Corpser Elite Guards and the Corpser Bandit Chief, then take the totem from the Corpser Bandit Chief.|
12641|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're happy that you and Mia ended up helping each other out. You tell Mia that you're ready to return to Candetonn with the good news.##char$$822$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Wait! You won't go before I thank you, will you? Please, take this. Without you I would have never succeeded."#br##br#
#&53$She smiles, offering you a small bag.##M131010$Mia$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"I found these things on some of the Corpser Bandits. I bet the Templars would love to have them."#M131010$Mia$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You grasp the small bag; it feels like it's stuffed with paper and the like.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"By the by, I know it's a lot to ask, but could you maybe not mention me? My whole mission was sort of a secret. I'd rather not have trouble come my way, you know?"#M131010$Mia$822$1#|
12642|#&7$Anya##br#
"A bag? Why would I want a bag? Are you making fun of me?"#npc$$821$1#|
12643|#&7$Anya##br#
"Where have you been, %n%? The soldiers told me you went to handle a situation with some Vampire Bats near the Corpser Camp and nobody's seen you since. I thought..."#M138010$Anya$823$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Well, I thought we might have lost you, %n%. You better explain yourself. We were worried sick!"#br##br#
#&53$Anya, normally calm and full of confidence, suddenly looks nervous and quite angry.##M138010$Anya$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Anya that the majority of the Corpser Bandits have been scattered. As for the remaining members, you believe a squad would be needed to handle them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"You've handled the bandits...all on your own? How is that even possible?! What did you do?"#M138010$Anya$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Knowing that time is of the essence, you briefly explain to Anya how you managed to manipulate the bats so that they would do all the work for you. Keeping in mind your agreement with Mia, you do not disclose her involvement.##char$$809:82$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Bats, huh? Who woulda thought! Good thinking, %n%. I'll get Alex working on the capture of the rest of the bandits straight away. Oh! By the way, did you find any clues about the Shadow Knight while you were out there?"#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You blush at Anya's belief that it was solely you who thought of the bat attack and reveal that you heard of the idea from your friends. Changing the subject, you state that you didn't manage to find any clue at all related to the Shadow Knight, but you did find a small bag completely stuffed with what feels like paper. You hand it over for Anya to inspect.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I guess I should be grateful that the Shadow Knight is not involved here - certainly Alex will be glad to not have to deal with him."#br##br#
#&53$Anya lets out a sigh of relief as she opens the small bag and begins to read one of the letters.##M138010$Anya$828$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"This...is...!"#br##br#
#&53$Anya's eyes widen in shock! She quickly turns to the soldiers, an expression of fury on her face.##M138010$Anya$823$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Listen up, soldiers! You are to arrest Will. Immediately! Bring him back to Navea for questioning. We have a traitor on our hands!"#M138010$Anya$826$1#

#&7$Soldier##br#
"Understood!"#M125010$Soldier$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As Anya barks out orders, you catch a glimpse of the letters in the bag. You see that Will's name is signed on one of them - he has been collaborating with the Corpser Bandits! Of course!##char$$823:72$0#|
12644|After defeating the Corpser Bandits, Mia gives you a small bag as a gift. She suggests you bring it to the Templars. 

Hand the Small Bag over to Candetonn's Templar, Anya.|

"%n%, we owe you for taking care of the Corpser Bandits. You're skills are improving quickly."#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Anya that you wouldn't have improved so fast without help.##char$$809$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"While you were gone, Alex sent me some news. Those strangers at the Fernscall Cottage are just researchers. The most recent victim, Lucas, was one of them."#M138010$Anya$825$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"We found out that some of their companions have been trapped in the Awlstone Forest. I've already sent my own soldiers there to help, but I was hoping you'd be able to lend a hand as well."#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and ask Anya what she needs done.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Get out there and kill all the Woodland and Hardshell Snails you can find. That will make it easier for my soldiers to lead the researchers out."#M138010$Anya$821$1#|
12652|#&7$Brennan##br#
"There are lots of these blasted snails around. You get rid of them, then we'll discuss the next part of the plan."#npc$$821$1#|
12653|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Brennan that Anya wants you to help him. Your job is to make sure the snails are out of the way.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Finally! Someone's here to help. There are only so many monsters that I can handle alone."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Honestly, if I had my way, we'd have already left! These blasted researchers are refusing, though."#npc$$828$1#|
12654|A group of researchers are trapped in Awlstone Forest and Anya has asked you to help rescue these researchers.

"Think you could convince them to leave? The longer we're out here, the more dangerous things get."#npc$$821$1#

"Convince those researchers to pack up and get out of here."#npc$$821$1#|
12663|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You can't convince the researchers to leave.##char$$821$0#

"Bloody, blasted bookworms..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Looks like our only choice is to help them finish their work."#npc$$821$1#|
12664|Even with the monsters growing more and more violent, the researchers have refused to leave. Brennan wants you to figure out why. 

Talk with researcher Archie.|
12665|#&7$Archie##br#
#&53$Archie's body tenses as he watches you approach.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Archie that it is too dangerous to remain here.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Thanks for the advice, but I can't leave."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"You do realize that, by staying out here, you're killing people? These soldiers and %n% are risking their lives to protect you!"#br##br#
#&53$%p% took the words right out of your mouth.##pet$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Oh my! What kind of creature is this? I've never seen anything like this before, and it can talk!"#br##br#
#&53$Archie stares at %p% as he flips through a small book.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Archie that %p% is your Eidolon and that you're an Envoy of Gaia.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Envoy of Gaia? I've heard that somewhere before... Maybe it was Lucas who mentioned it? Lucas..."#br##br#
#&53$Archie's voice turns solemn.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After hearing mention of an "Envoy of Gaia", the Shadow Knight immediately comes to mind. You hope Archie will say more.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Our research team is investigating the creatures around here. Something is corrupting them, making them more aggressive! Even the unicorns have changed."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Lucas was heading up the studies on unicorns. He started acting a bit weird, then he disappeared. That was the last time I saw him."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"We've got to keep working. We think we can reverse the effect on the unicorns. We're almost there, and I am sure Lucas would have wanted us to finish the job!"#npc$$826$1#|
12671|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Archie that you'll help if they agree to leave once they're finished.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Great! With your help, our work will go pretty quick. I wasn't sure we'd be able to do this ourselves!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"We have no idea why the unicorns turned violent. They've completely lost their minds. They're even attacking their young! We have to do something before they drive themselves extinct!"#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"I hate to do this, but you need to kill the contaminated unicorns. It is the only way to save the foals."#npc$$828$1#|
12672|#&7$Archie##br#
"Please go and kill the contaminated Unicorns. It is the only way to protect their foals."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
12673|#&7$Archie##br#
"Is it done?"#br##br#
#&53$Archie regards you with a grim expression, his shoulders sagging with sorrow.##npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Archie that the contaminated Unicorns have been eliminated.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Even though I regret what we had to do, I'd still like to thank you. Those foals will be able to grow up now."#npc$$821$1#|
12674|Archie tells you that the Unicorns have turned violent due to some sort contamination. They've even started attacking their own foals! He asks you to kill these contaminated Unicorns to protect their foals.

12681|#&7$Brennan##br#
"What should I do... I was told that Unicorns are spiritual beings! That means that, even after they die, their spirits linger."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Apparently we've got to collect this soul energy. Unfortunately, I can't take my eyes off those guys."#br##br#
#&53$Brennan jerks his thumb towards Archie.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"I'm worried that if I look away, they'll disappear. What would Alex say if I lost someone?"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Brennan that you'll gather the souls for him.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Good. After you kill a Unicorn, check their soul energy. If it isn't contaminated, bring it back here."#npc$$821$1#|
12682|#&7$Brennan##br#
"Please bring back the pure soul energy. We might be able to save the Unicorns with it."#npc$$821$1#|
12683|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the pure souls over to Brennan.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Thank you. Hopefully this satisfies those blasted researchers."#npc$$828$1#|
12684|If the Unicorns' souls have not been contaminated, they could probably be saved. As such, it has been requested that you gather the souls of slain Unicorns and bring them to Brennan.

"I don't think we'll be able to leave the foals alone,"#br#
#&53$Archie murmurs quietly.##npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"The swamp is more dangerous than we anticipated. It will be difficult for the Unicorn Foals to survive alone. We'll have to protect them ourselves."#br##br#
#&53$Archie hands you a large cloth bag.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"I need you to place the Unicorn foals into this bag, then bring them right back. And be careful! Don't hurt them!"#npc$$821$1#|
12692|#&7$Archie##br#
"Could you please bring the Unicorn Foals back? We need to protect them."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
12693|#&7$Archie##br#
"Do you have the Unicorn Foals? I hope you were careful with them. They're still so young!"#npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the foals to Archie; his eyes light up with affection as he opens the bag...##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Wait! The foals, they're covered in scars!"#br##br#
#&53$Archie looks angrily at you.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly explain that the scars aren't your fault.##char$$807:72$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"I know it wasn't you. These were caused by the contaminated unicorns."#npc$$823$1#|
12694|In order to protect the Unicorn Foals, Archie asks you to capture them and bring them back. 

Use the Cloth Bag to capture the Unicorn Foals in Awlstone Forest, then return the bag to Archie. Be careful!|

"Let's focus on healing the Unicorn foals first."#npcs85h+70$$828$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"There's a plant that grows near here called Fog Grass. Properly treated, the sap has powerful healing effects. Untreated, it is very poisonous."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask how to properly treat it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"We don't know, unfortunately. The Flower Butterfly Fairies, however, use the stuff for food. Our only choice is to take the purified sap from the fairies."#npc$$2$1#|
12702|#&7$Archie##br#
"You need to treat the Unicorn foals' injuries. Unfortunately, doing so requires you take purified Medicinal Herb Juice from Flower Butterfly Fairies."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
12703|#&7$Archie##br#
"If only I can heal those Unicorn Foals... This will not be a wasted trip! Gotta hold on a little longer...."#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Medicinal Herb Juice to Archie.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"This should be just enough to do the job! I'll treat the Unicorn Foals' injuries immediately."#br##br#
#&53$Archie takes the sap, thanking you.##npc$$822$1#|
12704|In order to treat the Unicorn foals' injuries, Archie asks you to obtain Medicinal Herb juice from the Flower Butterfly Fairies.

12711|#&7$Archie##br#
"I think we can figure out what is contaminating the Unicorns if we read Lucas' notes."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You wonder, aloud, what it was that Lucas had discovered.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"I remember him talking about clues he found after his trip into the woods. He'd said he wasn't ready to write a full report, though."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"I heard that when his body was found, he didn't have anything with him. Not even his notebook."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"After Lucas went missing, we tried to explore the depths of the Awlstone Forest ourselves, but were always stopped by the Stone Forest Turtles."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Archie that you'll defeat these Turtles so that they can explore freely.##char$$821$0#|
12712|#&7$Archie##br#
"Please go get rid of the Turtles in the Awlstone Forest. If we can safely explore, maybe we'll be able to learn what Lucas did!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
12713|#&7$Archie##br#
"Have you gotten rid of those turtles?"#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Archie that you took care of the Stone Forest Turtles.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"All of them? Really? Thank you! I'll get an investigative team together right away!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Are you serious? We agreed to leave after you finished with the Unicorns!"#br##br#
#&53$Brennan frowns, annoyed.##M121010$$823$0#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"%n%, you've got to stop them. I don't care if you've taken care of the turtles, our mission is to get these researchers out of here!"#M121010$$826$0#|
12714|Lucas may have found some clues about the Unicorn contamination while exploring the Awlstone Forest. Unfortunately, with his notes gone and the Stone Forest Turtles blocking the way, no further progress has been made. As such, Archie has asked you to take care of the Stone Forest Turtles. 

Defeat the Stone Forest Turtles in the Awlstone Forest.|
12721|#&7$Archie##br#
"I know you care about our safety, but we need to learn whatever Lucas did so we can end this contamination."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"%n% just risked life and limb to give us a chance to do this!"#br##br#
#&53$Archie explodes, looking desperate.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"Look, if you do this, what's going to happen to those injured Unicorn foals? Are you going to abandon them at the camp?"#M121010$$823$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"But..."#br##br#
#&53$Archie looks at you with pleading eyes.##npc$$1$1#

"%n%, how about you and I go? We'll be fine out there by ourselves"#pet$$821$0#|
12722|#&7$Archie##br#
"Please, head into the depths of the Awlstone Forest and tell me what you find." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
12723|#&7$Archie##br#
"You're back! Did you discover anything?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Archie that you found Arachnids. Lots of them. Unfortunately, you were forced to kill a number of them after they attacked.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"That's odd. That area isn't the Arachnids' normal range."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Based on what you say, though, it looks like these Arachnids may be carrying the contamination. We need to find out where they are coming from."#npc$$821$1#|
12724|In order to protect the researchers, you investigate the Awlstone Forest yourself. 

Destroy the Arachnids and Velvet Arachnids in the depths of the Awlstone Forest.|
12731|#&7$Archie##br#
"There are still people at the Fernscall Cottage, right? With a bunch of state-of-the-art equipment?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Archie##br#
"In order to verify where these Arachnids really came from, I need you to obtain some Arachnid bodily fluids."#br##br#
Archie hands you a glass bottle.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Brennan##br#
"%n% says that those arachnids attack people on sight! How are they supposed to gather the bodily fluids?"#M121010$$823$0#

#&7$Archie##br#
"Easy! You just need to weaken them so they can't fight back, then drain some of their bodily fluids into the bottle. This will definitely be possible with %n%'s skill and speed!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Archie#br#
"After you've collected the Arachnid bodily fluids, go straight to the Fernscall Cottage and find Oswald. I'll head back with Brennan."#npc$$821$1#|
12732|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Oswald that there are a group of Arachnids within the depths of the Awlstone Forest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Oswald##br#
"So,the Arachnids are the source of the contamination? Unfortunately, without some bodily fluids or something of the like, I can't tell you where they're from."#M103020$Oswald$821$1#|
12733|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You approach the young researcher.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Oswald##br#
"I heard about you from Archie. Thank you for all the help you've rendered. I've been told that the Unicorn foals will be here soon."#M103020$Oswald$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the full glass bottle over to Oswald before describing the Arachnids to him.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Oswald##br#
"Well... based on the evidence, these seem to be the same Arachnids that have taken northern Candetonn. What do you think, Jalen?"#br##br#
#&53$Oswald glances to the middle-aged man.##M103020$Oswald$823$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"It certainly seems like it. We still have tests to conduct, though."#M112010$Jalen$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$This man, Jalen, must be one of the Church researchers.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"%n%. It is good to finally meet you. Once we are able to analyze these fluids, we'll have an answer."#M112010$Jalen$821$1#|
12734|Archie thinks that these Arachnids are the source of the contamination, so he asks you to gather their bodily fluids and take them to the Fernscall Cottage. 

Use the glass bottle on the Arachnids in the depths of the Awlstone Forest. After collecting their bodily fluids, give the bottle to Oswald at the Fernscall Cottage.|
12741|#&7$Jalen##br#
"%n%, I need your assistance while we run the tests."#br##br#
#&53$Jalen looks towards the Fernscall Cottage.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"There's a lot of important work going on around here. It is pretty hard work, but it is also very important work. As such, we should do whatever we can to help."#M112010$Jalen$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod in agreement.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"When our soldiers were helping the researchers get out of the forest, the cries of the Unicorn foals attracted a group of contaminated Unicorns."#M112010$Jalen$827$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"I don't want to just rely on the soldiers, though. If even a single thing is damaged, it will set our research back weeks. Let's take preemptive action. Clear those Unicorns out before they attack!"#M112010$Jalen$826$1#|
12742|#&7$Jalen##br#
"We could be attacked by the Unicorns at any moment. Chase them off as quickly as you can!"#npc$$821$1#|
12743|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Jalen that you've defeated the Unicorns that were threatening Fernscall Cottage.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"I guess you really are as powerful as the rumors say."#M112010$Jalen$825$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"While you were busy, we managed to finish our testing. They confirm that these Arachnids are similar to the Arachnids in the northern part of the marsh. They are definitely the same species."#M112010$Jalen$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The results are the same as what the scholars speculated. You ask Jalen if there's a way to find out where the Arachnids originated.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"These Arachnids are blind, meaning they live in total darkness. Based on the proteins in their body, they largely subsist on aquatic fare. After a discussion, we've reached a conclusion."#M112010$Jalen$821$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"These traits indicate that they live in the Candeo Core, in the northwestern part of the Candeo Marsh."#M112010$Jalen$826$1#|
12744|The contaminated Unicorns threaten the Cottage, so Jalen asks you to take care of them before they became a problem. 

Defeat the contaminated Unicorns near the Fernscall Cottage.|
12751|#&7$Jalen##br#
"There aren't any past records of them leaving the Candeo Core. Something must have changed that drove them out."#M112010$Jalen$821$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"Hmm, well... The Candeo Core is southwest of the Sarpa Abyss. Could that be connected somehow? Oswald has told me that, when they were searching for Lucas, their investigations were hindered by turtles outside the Sarpa Abyss."#M112010$Jalen$828$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"I doubt those creatures will be able to stop you, though..."#br##br#
#&53$Jalen hands you a device.##M112010$Jalen$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask what Jalen is getting at and what the machine is for.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"If you could install this scanner at the entrance to the Sarpa Abyss, we can use it to obtain data about recent changes to the environment. Unfortunately, to keep the machine safe, you'll need to chase the turtles away."#M112010$Jalen$821$1#|
12752|#&7$Jalen##br#
"Head to the Sarpa Abyss with the machine. Once you've got it in place, use it to gather environmental data."#npc$$821$1#|
12753|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You chase the turtles away, then get the report from the machine. You pass all the data along to Jalen.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"So you managed to get the data? Let me see it."#br##br#
#&53$Jalen looks the figures over intently.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"Hmm... If this data is right, Sarpa activity near the Sarpa Abyss has increased."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"The Sarpa used to stay confined to the Candeo Core, but now they're coming out en masse! Without question, something is changing in that marsh."#npc$$821$1#|
12754|In order to investigate what is happening at the Candeo Core, Jalen asks you to get rid of the turtles in the area, then install a scanner to collect data. 

Get rid of the Bayou Turtles near the entrance of the Candeo Core, then install the scanner.|

"It looks like we're going to need to investigate the Candeo Core directly."#M112010$Jalen$823$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"According to the reports regarding the Demarech Mines, the Shadow Knight has the ability to mutate the environment. I fear that may be what's happening here."#M112010$Jalen$828$1#

#&7$Jalen##br#
"Report all of this to Anya, then talk with the Village Chief. He should be able to tell you about the Candeo Core. We're going to need that information to conduct an investigation."#M112010$Jalen$827$1#|
12762|#&7$Jeffery##br#
"It is good to see you again!" #npc$$821$1#|
12763|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Jeffery about the Candeo Core in the Candeo Marsh. He seems surprised by your question.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"Why would you want to know about the Candeo Core? Well, I'll certainly tell you whatever I know."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"The Candeo Core is the marsh's primary water source. You've seen the dam north of here, right? The Candeo Core is the reason for it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"We knew the Sarpa lived in the Candeo Core. Seems like they always stayed inside it."#npc$$827$1##&PP00803#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$That information was useful, but it didn't reveal anything new. Still, you should pass it along to Anya.##char$$806:0$0#|

"Back already? So, what happened?"#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&53$You tell Anya about everything that has happened, including your suspicions that the Shadow Knight might be altering the Candeo Core.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Well then! We'll just have to investigate the Candeo Core! I'll get my men together so we can get started. While we get ready, can you ask Jeffery if there's anything else he knows?"#M138010$Anya$825$1#|
12771|#&7$Anya##br#
"According to Jeffery, the Sarpa can't speak. As such, we're going to have to get information more directly."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"First, we need to find out how long the Sarpa have been roaming outside of the cave. Sarpa are covered in Waterweed, right? Maybe we can use that."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Head to the Sarpa Abyss, subdue some Sarpa, and get me Waterweed. I'm sure we'll be able to learn something from it."#npc$$821$1#|

"What's up, %n%? Any trouble getting the waterweed?"#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&53$You tell Alex about Lucas' death, including the involvement of the Sarpa and the Shadow Knight.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
#&53$Alex's expression changes dramatically at the mention of the Shadow Knight; he doesn't let you finish.##M137010$Alex$826$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"We need to get in there and figure out what's going on! The Sarpa can speak, eh? Maybe they can tell us about the Shadow Knight!"#M137010$Alex$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're surprised by Alex's sudden ferocity. You have to rein him in, as Anya asked you to keep him from taking careless action.##char$$821:80$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"So... what? I'm supposed to wait here and do nothing? I guess Anya is in charge..."#br##br#
#&53$Alex smiles bitterly. He is definitely unhappy.##M137010$Alex$829$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Fine. I'll stay here. You, though... I'll trust you to deal with the Sarpa, %n%. I'll assign you some soldiers, you take them to the Sarpa Abyss and take care of the problem!"#M137010$Alex$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Well... What Alex asks doesn't conflict with Anya's order. You agree to his request.##char$$828:80$0#|

"Back already? Have you destroyed the Sarpa?"#M137010$Alex$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Alex that the Sarpa attacked your group with some sort of toxic mist. The soldiers are receiving emergency treatment.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"The Sarpa actually know how to set traps? I thought they were too stupid to do that... What's going on here?"#br##br#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Alex, this happened because you were too impulsive! I told you to wait!"#br##br#

"You need to calm down. When a commander gets too emotional, their soldiers are going to get killed."#M138010$Anya$821$0#|

"%n%, is Alex oka- no, nevermind. Ahem. According to the results we're getting from our tests, there have been significant changes to the Arachnids and the Sarpa."#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Only the Cube of Gaia can do things like this. The Shadow Knight must be behind this. We have to stop it from spreading any further!"#M138010$Anya$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You want to ask Anya why Alex has become so agitated upon hearing about the Shadow Knight, but it doesn't seem to be the right time.##char$$828:0$0#

"We're going to have to be more careful this time. While we get our soldiers prepped, I have a special job for you: eliminate the Arachnids outside the Sarpa Abyss."#M138010$Anya$821$1#|

"Good! Now I can lead my troops into the Sarpa Abyss safely."#npc$$821$1#|
12794|While Anya prepares her troops to enter the Sarpa Abyss, you need to take care of the Arachnids lurking outside of it. It would be quite bad if the squad are mobbed by Arachnids before they make it to the Abyss!

"To keep everyone safe, we'll need to clear the Arachnid eggs out of the Sarpa Abyss."#npc$$821$1#|

"Well? Do you have the map?"#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$Anya opens the map and examines it closely, occasionally nodding to herself.##M138010$Anya$1$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The main entrance is in the north, but it seems to be the entrance the Sarpa use as well. Look at the pool right in front of it! We certainly don't want to encounter the Sarpa there."#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Jeffery is right. We want to use this western entrance. But we need to get rid of Sarpa around the Sarpa Abyss first."#M138010$Anya$825$1#

"Looks like we'll still need your help. Oh, and talk to Penny if you get the chance. She could use a hand."#M138010$Anya$821$1#|

"I can't believe I was almost fooled into believing a vampire was responsible for what was happening in the marsh. I guess I haven't gotten that much wiser over the years..."#M119020$Jeffery$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You carefully remind Jeffery that you're in a hurry.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"Right, right, sorry. Yes, the map. Here it is. It's a little old, but it details both the cave and the dam's systems. It is honestly an ingenious system... and one we've obviously gotten a little lazy on checking in on."#M119020$Jeffery$825$1#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"I guess it worked a little too well, eh?"#M119020$Jeffery$827$1#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"Go ahead and take this back to Anya. My memory is a little rusty, but I'd say the western entrance is your best bet."#br##br#

"We're going to need to deal with the Sarpa Leader sooner or later. In my opinion, sooner will be better than later."#M138010$Anya$826$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The problem is that my scouts have reported that she's holed herself up in the Candeo Core. Who knows what sort of traps they have planned for us. So, I've been thinking, why go after the leader directly? Why not start by slaughtering some of their minions?"#M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're not really sure how that's going to help. Wouldn't your energy be better used penetrating the Sarpa Leader's defenses?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Well, %n%, sapience is a two-sided sword. The Sarpa Leader is smart enough to establish ambushes and hide herself. Let's see how she reacts to us exacting a little vengeance on her troops. I bet you she'll come out on her own."#M138010$Anya$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

"Oh good! I was hoping she'd ask you to!"#M106030$Penny$825$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"So you remember those Arachnids you brought me? Based on the evidence, the logical conclusion is that they're from the Candeo Core."#M106030$Penny$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod. You remember the evidence pointing to them originating from a dark cave. The Candeo Core was, really, the only place that made sense.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"We managed to find an ecology survey from five or so years ago that detailed creatures living in and around the Candeo Core. The bugs certainly seem similar... give or take a few hundred to a few thousand years worth of evolution."#M106030$Penny$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Penny what she means.##char$$823:0$0#

"Something is causing the creatures around here to evolve far faster than they should be. It pretty much explains, well, everything that's going on!"#M106030$Penny$827$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I need to do what I can do to confirm this, so I was hoping you'd be able to bring me some Sarpa scales. If I could examine them, I'd be able to see the scale of the physical changes they've undergone."#M106030$Penny$821$1#|
12832|#&7$Penny##br#
"Please get me some Sarpa scales so I can investigate their changes."#npc$$821$1#|

#&7$Penny##br#
"Like I thought. The changes in the Arachnids and Sarpa are quite similar: they are clearly evolving at an incredibly accelerated rate. Worse, these changes are making them more aggressive and causing them to expand their territory."#M106030$Penny$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You think you know the answer already, but you ask Penny what she thinks could be causing this.##char$$823:0$0#

"By controlling the Cube of Gaia."#pet$$821$1#

"So, bring me back some fresh Hoofbeast meat. And seriously, don't try to trick me. I know what fresh, healthy Hoofbeast tastes like."#M009020$Baird$825$1#|

#&53$With that, Para Ryan swaggers off.##M009100$Para Ryan$821$1#|
12934|Para refused to believe that you captured the Jerboas. On the advice of Baird, he issued you another test: hunting Hoofbeasts in the east. You have to bring back Hoofbeast Meat as proof.

12941|#&7$Baird##br#
"You're going to have to play this carefully, %n%. Don't look at me like that. The Second Prince isn't happy with your success. At all. He probably would have had your head if I hadn't intervened."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask about the rebels.##char$$821$0##&PP00902#

#&7$Baird##br#
"Well... the rebel's general, Micha, allied with Tatiana, the Third Prince's beloved. They launched an attack against the King, swearing they'd restore the Third Prince's honor. I really don't think that's part of Micha's plan, though."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"Can't worry about that right now, though. You need to get some Stable Wind Grass. Without that, my plan is going to be dead in the water."#M009020$Baird$821$1#|
12942|#&7$Baird##br#
"Don't worry, I'm on your side. I'll make sure the Second Prince respects you. Honestly, you've got the easier job. Probably the safer one, too."#br##br#
#&53$Baird grins.##M009020$Baird$825$1#|
12943|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the Stable Wind Grass to Baird, asking why he needs them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Baird##br#
"This is something that will be more difficult for you to understand. See, our culture is very different from yours."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"You need to understand that, even as enemies, we still respect each other. Those we conquer become our own, and must wear our braids. It acknowledges their defeat and shows their respect to the victors."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"It may seem silly to you, but it is very important to us."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your thoughts drift back to the braid you saw Odum Ryan wearing. So they are both a sign of loyalty and submission...##char$$828:0$0#|
12944|Para Ryan was furious that you were passing his tests, but Baird suggested temporarily assigning you to the Lion's Roar Army, the elite troops under Para's command. You're now working for Baird, and Para Ryan guaranteed that, if you succeeded, he'd consider allying with the Church. Your first mission is to gather some plants.

Go to the stream, collect some Stable Wind Grass, and bring them to Baird.|

#&7$Baird##br#
"You'll be joining the advanced team. Your job is to head out ahead of the main troop and eliminate any immediate dangers."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"If my information is correct, we'll be passing through Rhino territory. There's no way our forces would make it through unscathed. See if you can find a way to drive those beasts off."#M009020$Baird$821$1#|
12952|#&7$Baird##br#
"I have to admit, I didn't think you'd take this so... calmly. Even my bravest warriors would be worried taking this mission on."#M009020$Baird$821$1#|
12953|#&7$Baird##br#
"The advanced team says you did great work."#br##br#
#&53$Baird pats you on the shoulder.##M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"Go and get your equipment in order. The next job is going to something really challenging."#M009020$Baird$821$1#|
12954|Baird had you join the advanced team, and asked you to clear the route of rhinos.

"We didn't have a lot of time to prepare for this battle. We're still missing a lot of supplies..."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"Our biggest problem right now is an armor shortage. Since you're familiar with the Rhinos, why don't you skin a few to help us out?"#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"Hides from Armored Rhinos would be perfect."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"So, hurry up and bring me those hides! I don't want my warriors fighting without armor!"#M009020$Baird$821$1#|
12962|#&7$Baird##br#
"Remember, we need hides from the Armored Rhinos. If you could make sure they're Rough Rhino Hides, that'd be best."#M009020$Baird$821$1#|
12963|#&7$%n%##br#

"There's still a lot of work to be done."#M009020$Baird$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#

"His end is coming!"#M038050$Tatiana$827$1#|
13034|Tatiana has betrayed the rebels and is using her knowledge of their plans and strategies against them. Their first plan is to gather their spellcasters together and launch an all-out attack to cripple the army. Stop them before they can gather!

Eliminate the Rebel Casters.|

"We need to cause some chaos to draw their guards out. They're used to being on the offensive. If we could hit them in multiple places at once, they'd fall apart!"#M038050$Tatiana$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"We should start by setting fire to their supplies. They'll pull most of their troops in to deal with that. Once they do that, we surround and crush them!"#M038050$Tatiana$821$1#

"The battle competition? Isn't that for the Makar alone? How strange! How very strange!"#M015010$Shashek$2$1#

#&53$You watch Shashek look you up and down.##char$$828:0$0#|
13104|Pascal is almost ready to make your armor, but first you need a War Spirit. He thinks Shashek will help you, but only if you prove yourself by defeating his guards.

"I never thought I'd see the Makar allow an outsider to participate. A human, no less! Times are changing..."#M015010$Shashek$2$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"Well, it doesn't matter to me anyway. If you're competing, you have as much right to a War Spirit as anyone."#M015010$Shashek$1$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"You defeated my guards, so you're definitely strong. But this test isn't just about strength."#M015010$Shashek$1$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
#&53$Shashek sings a prayer.##M015010$Shashek$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The words ring in your ears, causing you to tense up. Something feels... strange.##char$$1$0#

#&53$You turn to %p%, but it's staring at Shashek in rapt attention. You ask what it feels.##char$$821$0#

"I feel some sort of... energy. Could it be...?"#pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You want to know more, but Shashek finishes his prayer before you can ask anything else.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"The God of War will grant you a War Spirit. If you can pass his test, of course."#M015010$Shashek$2012$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"He wants you to battle the Mudlings and Waterlings around the pool. Each type will have a specific core inside some of them. Once you have both cores, bring them back."#M015010$Shashek$2$1#|
13112|#&7$Shashek##br#
"What an odd turn of events..."#M015010$Shashek$821$1#|

#&7$Shashek##br#
"This year's competition may be worth watching."#br##br#
#&53$Shashek smiles.##M015010$Shashek$51$1#|
13114|Shashek says you need to get two different cores from the nearby Mudlings and Waterlings to pass the God of War's test.

"Did you know the remnants of the rebels are hiding out nearby?"#M015010$Shashek$821$1#

"The God of War only offers one chance. If they interrupt the ritual, you're finished. No second chance, no do-over, no mulligan."#M015010$Shashek$821$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"This ritual is your responsibility. I recommend you protect it by getting rid of any potential interruptions."#M015010$Shashek$821$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"I don't need to tell you what to do, right?"#M015010$Shashek$821$1#

#&53$You shake your head. It looks like you aren't finished with the rebels yet.##char$$828:80$0#|
13122|#&7$Shashek##br#
"You're the first human to come here. In all the years I've been here, you really are the first. What a strange human you are."#M015010$Shashek$821$1#|
13123|#&7$Shashek##br#
"Will you ever cease to amaze me? You crushed those rebels so easily!"#br##br#
#&53$Shashek's interest in you seems to still be growing.##M015010$Shashek$821$1#

"Well, Envoy, I look forward to seeing you compete."#M015010$Shashek$1$1#|

"The God of War has recognized your abilities. Your strength, your determination, your intelligence... he's seen it all. You have been judged worthy."#br##br#

#&53$Pascal waits expectantly.##M038040$Pascal$821$1#|
13133|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Pascal about the tests as you hand over the War Spirit.##char$$821$0#

"Lucky you, getting to kill more rebels! Those test sounded way more exciting than the usual ones."#br##br#
#&53$Pascal grins broadly.##M038040$Pascal$824$1#

#&7$Pascal##br#
"This War Spirit is magnificent..."#br##br#

#&7$Pascal##br#
"You have brought me such amazing materials... This armor will be my greatest masterpiece."#M038040$Pascal$821$1#

"%n%, honor my work by winning!"#M038040$Pascal$821$1#|

#&7$Shep##br#
"I heard you brought Pascal some real treasures."#M037020$Shep$2$1#

#&7$Shep##br#
#&53$Shep seemed strangely energetic.##br##br#
"I may not like you, but you're getting results. You don't see quality material like that often."#M037020$Shep$826$1#

#&7$Shep##br#
"You better bring me something just as good, though. Head to the Filthrun Croft. I need some War Breath."#M037020$Shep$821$1#

#&7$Shep##br#
"You'll need to meet with Adonis to get it. Try challenging some of the Centaurs around the area. If Adonis judges you skilled, he'll let you test."#M037020$Shep$821$1#|

"Oh ho... how many failures will they send? They need a better selection process."#M015030$Adonis$821$1#|

13144|Shep needs a War Breath to put the finishing touches on your weapons. To get it, you'll need to challenge the Centaurs in Filthrun Croft. If you prove your strength, Adonis will let you test and, hopefully, give you a War Breath.

13151|#&7$Adonis##br#
"I've heard all about you from Shashek. But I suppose you're getting tired of people knowing about you, eh?"#M015030$Adonis$1$1#

#&7$Adonis##br#
"This is going to be fun, though. I keep my tests personal. No spirits this time, just you and me!"#M015030$Adonis$2$1#

#&7$Adonis##br#
"First: bring me some branches from the Tree of the Dead. Be careful, though! The VERY venomous Deadwood Spiders love that tree."#M015030$Adonis$2012$1#

"You wouldn't be the first test taker to die trying to get those branches!"#M015030$Adonis$1$1#

"So, you aren't afraid of death, are you? And you're skilled enough to avoid it. I guess Shashek was right about you."#M015030$Adonis$1$1#

#&7$Adonis##br#
"That was just a pre-test test, though. Now it's time to see what you are really made of."#M015030$Adonis$2$1#|
13154|As a test, Adonis asked you to gather branches from the Tree of the Dead.

"Yar!"#br##br#
#&53$Adonis bellows as he throws the branches into his magic circle. He then hands you an emblem.##M015030$Adonis$2011$1#

"Sure, I'd appreciate the help. It's so tiring to keep driving those Jerboas off."#M015030$Adonis$1$1#

#&7$Adonis##br#
"They just like taking more and more territory. The problem is, they carry parasites that are harmful to the Trees of the Dead. If I leave them alone, they'll kill the Trees, the arachnids will kill them, or they'll all die! Do you think you could you help me drive them off?"#M015030$Adonis$1$1#|
13172|#&7$Adonis##br#
"Hmmm..."#br##br#
#&53$Adonis seems lost in thought.##M015030$Adonis$1$1#|

"Take a look around us. You see all the wild Rhinos around here?"#br##br#
#&53$Mummer gestures around the both of you.##M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"They aren't sure how to react to all the soldiers around here. Some of them have even tried attacking squads and camps!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"We can't have them attacking us while we battle the Gnomes. They could easily swing the battle against us."#M009070$Mummer$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're pretty sure you know the answer, but you ask what he'd like you to do.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Do what you do best, of course: eliminate the problem. Get out there and kill some rhinos! Pretty sure you'll handle it better than three full squads could!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13242|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Don't worry, I won't start the real fun without you. You take care of the Rhinos, I'll get the attack organized."#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13243|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You return to Mummer after taking care of the Rhinos.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Great, it'll just be us and the Gnomes on the battlefield. We're ready to get started!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13244|Mummer is almost ready to launch an attack against the Gnomes, but the local Rhinos are a serious threat. He needs you to deal with them so they don't attack the army while the Gnomes and Makar fight.

Drive off the nearby Grassland Rhinos and Wild Rhinos.|
13251|#&7$Mummer##br#
"I've been thinking. It is well and good that the rhinos aren't a danger to us anymore, but I think we can still use them."#M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"If you could capture a rhino alive, then we'd be able to chain it up near the Gnomes. We let it cry for help, then the rest of the rhinos come down to rescue it and smash the Gnomes up good!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"What do you think, %n%? You willing to help me with this plan?"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13252|#&7$Mummer##br#
"We'll charge right after the rhinos do. I can't wait to see the Gnomes' reactions! The King is going to love this!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13253|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You don't even need ask Mummer how you did. His expression says it all.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Beautifully done! Beautifully done!"#br##br#
#&53$Mummer pats your shoulder enthusiastically.##M009070$Mummer$825$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"I have to admit, the idea wasn't really mine. Our King was the one who pioneered this tactic. It certainly still seems to work."#M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
#&53$Mummer smiles as he looks over the chaos.##M009070$Mummer$1$1#|
13254|Mummer's plan takes advantage of the nature of the Rhinos' herd mentality and will trick them into attacking the Gnomes.

Capture a Rhino using a lasso and take it to the Gnome's gate.|
13261|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Fellow Makar! Listen!"#br##br#
#&53$Mummer addresses the soldiers loudly.##M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"These Gnomes have insulted our King! They've poisoned the Eldest Prince! They have spit on the honor of the Lion's Roar Army!"#M009070$Mummer$826$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Now look at them! They're laughing at us inside their camp! They think they are safe from us!"#M009070$Mummer$826$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"We will show those filthy Gnomes! The Lion's Roar Army will wipe them out and bring glory to the King!"#br##br#
#&53$The soldiers around you roar in agreement as they charge into battle.##M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Come on, %n%! We're getting left behind! First we need to eliminate their vanguard! Without them, the rest will fall!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13262|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Third Company, hit their flank! Surround those Gnomes! Guards, follow me!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13263|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Hahahahahahaha! This battle is glorious! Look at the Gnomes scurry and run!"#br##br#
#&53$Mummer laughs uproariously.##M009070$Mummer$825$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"%n%, isn't this grand? I can see it in your eyes: you're a real warrior!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13264|The battle is officially on! Mummer wants you to help defeat the Gnomish vanguard. 

Kill the Oracle Vanguards.|
13271|#&7$Mummer##br#
"What? The Gnomes have defensive magic? I didn't think they knew how to use totems. Blasted Gnomes."#br##br#
#&53$Mummer looks surprised.##M009070$Mummer$823$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"What a pain, now we've got to deal with the totems. I hate magic!"#M009070$Mummer$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You told Mummer not to worry, because you'd handle it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Good! I certainly don't know a lot about these totems!"#M009070$Mummer$825$1#|
13272|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Our warlocks should learn this sort of magic. It'd be pretty helpful if we ever met a worthy foe."#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13273|#&7$Mummer##br#
"I don't know what we'd do without your help!"#br##br#
#&53$Mummer salutes you.##M009070$Mummer$822$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Get the message to the men! We're going to charge!"#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13274|The Makar have successfully breached the Gnomish defenses. However, the totems in the camp are causing serious problems. Get in there and destroy them! 

Infiltrate the Gnomish camp and destroy the Oracle Totems.|
13281|#&7$Lion's Roar Scout##br#
"Warlord! The Sixth and First squads are surrounded and need backup!"#br##br#
#&53$The scout reports the news anxiously.##M009050$Lion's Roar Scout$828$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Tell them reinforcements are on their way. Have Third and Fourth squads send support. Everyone else will secure a path of retreat."#M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Lion's Roar Scout##br#
"Sir!"#M009050$Lion's Roar Scout$822$0#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"These Gnomes are more clever than I expected."#M009070$Mummer$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"%n%, I'm feeling a little uneasy... Could you go back them up? I want to make sure nothing goes wrong."#M009070$Mummer$821$1#|
13282|#&7$Ike##br#
"Are you here to help, %n%?"#br##br#
#&53$Ike gasps tiredly.##M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13283|#&7$Ike##br#
"We need any help we can get."#br##br#
#&53$Ike seems exhausted.##M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Ike about Mummer's orders.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"What? No! No! NO!"#br##br#
#&53$Ike's reaction is surprising.##M009080$Ike$823$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"This is a trap! They wanted to draw a large group of reinforcements in! If they try to break through to us, they'll be wiped out!"#M009080$Ike$828$1#|
13284|Although the Makar have broken through the Gnomish lines, several squads are in grave danger. You need to do something!

Slay the Oracle Berserkers, then meet with Vanguard Stone Guard Ike.|
13291|#&7$Ike##br#
"It's the Oracles' Sorcerers! They've created some sort of... miasma... that weakens anyone who inhales it."#M009080$Ike$828$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"A minute in it is enough to reduce the most hardened warrior to a mewling runt. We can't let anymore of our warriors fall into this trap!"#M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Ike that you seem resistant to their magic, so maybe you could take care of it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Hah! I bet those little sorcerers didn't think we'd have a Human helping us!"#M009080$Ike$823$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Go do it! I have no doubt you'll crush them and find an antidote!"#M009080$Ike$825$1#|
13292|#&7$Ike##br#
"Hang in there, everyone! We'll need to survive long enough for %n% to do their job! Let's show them we aren't afraid!"#br##br#
#&53$Ike bellows over the roar of battle, trying to raise the morale of his soldiers.##M009080$Ike$824$1#|
13293|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the antidote to Ike.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"This is the antidote? It looks foul."#br##br#
#&53$Ike eyes the antidote suspiciously.##M009080$Ike$828$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Not like we have a choice! I'll try it first to see if it's safe."#br##br#
#&53$Despite an apparently sickening taste, Ike managed to down the antidote.##M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Ick, Ike!"#br##br#
#&53$%p% watches sympathetically as Ike drinks it.##pet$$1$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Urgh... it seems like it works, at least."#br##br#
#&53$Ike is already looking a bit stronger... though he also looks a bit sick.##M009080$Ike$828$1#|
13294|Ike says his troops have been weakened by magic from the Gnomes' sorcerers. Since you seem resistant to their magic, he wants you to recover an antidote from them.

Kill the Oracle Sorcerers and find the Miasma Antidote.|
13301|#&7$Ike##br#
"We don't have time to warn the reinforcements, and we don't have enough of the antidote to deal with more of our warriors falling victim to the miasma. We'll need to handle this ourselves."#br##br#
#&53$Ike sighs as he looks out over the battlefield.##M009080$Ike$828$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Those sorcerers are the cause of all of our problems. If we throw everything we've got at them, we might be able to wipe them out."#M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"%n%, we must kill as many sorcerers as possible before the reinforcements arrive. For every one of us that falls, let a dozen Gnomes follow them!"#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13302|#&7$Ike##br#
"Go! Slaughter their sorcerers! Die if you must, but not before you've shown the Gnomes your warrior's spirit!"#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13303|#&7$Ike##br#
"I never thought we'd survive this long."#br##br#
#&53$Ike's breath come in rapid gasps.##M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"If it weren't for you, we'd all be dead right now."#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13304|To keep more Makar warriors from falling victim to the Gnomish miasma, Ike asks you to join them and help slaughter their sorcerers.

Eliminate the Oracle Sorcerers in the camp.|
13311|#&7$Ike##br#
"The situation here is improving. The battle is far from over, though."#br##br#
#&53$Ike looks exhausted.##M009080$Ike$828$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Is everyone ready to help our kin?"#br##br#
#&53$Ike's voice rises over the sound of battle.##M009080$Ike$824$1#

#&7$Makar Warriors##br#
#&53$The Makar Warriors offer a faint cheer, but you can tell they're exhausted.##M009010$Makar Warriors$822$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Ike if there is anything you can do for them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"%n%... we're at our limit. We can't launch another offensive. Some of our kin have been captured by the Gnomes. Try to free them. We might be able to do something with a few more able-bodied warriors fighting with us."#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13312|#&7$Ike##br#
"Live and die as warriors! Pay for the King's respect with blood!"#br##br#
#&53$Ike tries his best to raise the morale of his weary warriors.##M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13313|#&7$Ike##br#
"Ha... we've survived... we've proven we are the masters of this land..."#M009080$Ike$824$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
#&53$As he speaks, there is a commotion behind the troops. It seems the Gnomes are falling back.##M009080$Ike$1$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"We all owe you our lives. Not one of us would be going home without you."#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13314|Ike knows there are still many warriors trapped by the Gnomes, so he wants you to help them. It won't be much, but having their support might help the squad hold out.

Kill the Oracle Recruits inside the camp.|
13321|#&7$Ike##br#
"Hopefully these prisoners will help us out. We need to end this battle soon."#br##br#
#&53$Ike takes a deep breath.##M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You agree. You have more than just this battle to worry about. Kali still needs you to find an antidote for the Eldest Prince. You ask Ike if he has seen any Oracle Alchemists.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Alchemists? Of course I've seen them. I've just killed at least a half-dozen of them myself."#br##br#
#&53$Ike smiles.##M009080$Ike$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Ike about Kali's needs and that finding an alchemist is critical if the Eldest Prince is to survive.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Then you have my full support!"#br##br#
#&53$Ike's spirits seem to lift.##M009080$Ike$824$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Wait, %n%. I've heard the poison in Eldest Prince's body is also infused with magic. We should slaughter more of their magic users while we hunt their alchemists."#M009080$Ike$828$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"If we combine alchemist and magic user hunting, we'll guarantee a recovery for the Eldest Prince."#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13322|#&7$Ike##br#
"Don't worry. We'll catch up with you soon enough. You just worry about curing the Eldest Prince!"#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13323|#&7$Ike##br#
"How's it going for you?"#br##br#
#&53$Ike seems disappointed.##M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Ike the various useless medicines you found. He looks at each one and shakes his head.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Just like us, then. We didn't find anything of value on the alchemists. But we might have found something else."#M009080$Ike$828$1#|
13324|Find the alchemists in the camp and search the medicine boxes they carry. You need to find an antidote for the Eldest Prince. You should also eliminate their magic users when possible.

Get the medicine boxes from the Oracle Alchemists and eliminate the Oracle Sorcerer Guards.|
13331|#&7$Ike##br#
"Tell us, what did you use to poison the Eldest Prince? If you don't talk, you'll die!"#br##br#
#&53$Ike snarls fiercely at the captive.##M009080$Ike$826$1#

#&7$Captured Gnome##br#
"I'll tell you if you kill everyone else around here. Oh, and yourself. After that, I'll tell you."#br##br#
#&53$The Gnome taunts Ike ruthlessly.##M044040$Captured Gnome$825$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Fine! Die!"#br##br#
#&53$Ike prepares to deliver a deathblow.##M009080$Ike$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You stop Ike from delivering the final blow. You ask him to let you give it a try.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"All right, I'll let you try. If you don't get him to talk, I'm killing him."#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13332|#&7$Ike##br#
"%n%! He's not going to tell us anything! Let's make him pay for his crimes!"#M009080$Ike$826$1#|
13333|#&7$Ike##br#
"That was... a thing. I've never seen an interrogation like that before."#br##br#
#&53$Ike looks at you questioningly.##M009080$Ike$823$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"Well, no matter. We got the information we need." #M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13334|Interrogate the Captured Gnome. You must find a way to force him to tell you where an antidote can be found. Perhaps a bit of trickery will work... 

"Use" the Torture Tool to interrogate the Captured Gnome.|
13341|#&7$Ike##br#
"Wesker... He's the Gnome's overlord. Guess it would make sense for him to keep such a powerful medicine in his care."#M009080$Ike$821$1#

#&7$Ike##br#
"What are we going to do? Wesker is likely in the heart of the camp, but we don't have the strength to break through their lines."#M009080$Ike$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Ike to let you handle it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ike##br#
"I know you're strong, but are you sure you want to go alone? Wesker is a very powerful enemy."#M009080$Ike$821$1#|
13342|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Why'd you come back alone? Tell me about the current situation."#M037040$Leo Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
#&53$He conceals it well, but Leo Ryan is very nervous.##M037040$Leo Ryan$1$1#|
13343|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"That'll show those meddlesome Gnomes!"#br##br#
#&53$Leo bursts into laughter.##M037040$Leo Ryan$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the Oracle Ointment to Kali. You tell Leo how you took it from Wesker, and that it should be able to save Palo.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Is it true? Kali, give my son that medicine! Now!"#M037040$Leo Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Kali##br#
#&53$Kali looks at the Oracle Ointment sadly.##br##br#
"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but this isn't the antidote we need." #M038030$Kali$821$0#

#&7$Kali##br#
"This is called the Oracle Ointment. While it works well for physical injuries, it won't do anything for this poison." #M038030$Kali$828$0#|
13344|The time has come to end this. You need to deal with the Gnome's Overlord, Wesker.

Kill Wesker and bring back whatever medicine you can find.|
13351|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"...this is not your fault, %n%. You have done everything you can. Palo's suffering will end soon."#br##br#
#&53$You can see the sadness in Leo's eyes.##M037040$Leo Ryan$828$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"He's reaped what he's sown. Even if he were to recover, no one would respect him. It is better this way."#M037040$Leo Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
#&53$It seems obvious that Leo Ryan doesn't believe his own words.##M037040$Leo Ryan$1$1#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"We shouldn't give up so easily, your Majesty."#br##br#
#&53$Shalen interjects carefully.##M038020$Shalen$823$0#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"Do you remember the old legend about the Tears of Ares? It's a magical grass that can only be found in the Wrathborne Temple. It might be able to save the Eldest Prince!"#M038020$Shalen$821$0#

#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"That's right, father. Don't give up so easily. If %n% and I go to Shashek together, he may allow us to enter the Wrathborne Temple."#M009100$Para Ryan$821$0#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Would you be willing to do that, %n%? Are you willing to further risk your life for my foolish son?"#M037040$Leo Ryan$821$1#|
13352|#&7$Shashek##br#
"I didn't expect to see you here again so soon. Tell me, what brought you here?"#M015010$Shashek$821$1#|
13353|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Para speaks up before you have the chance.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"Shashek, as one of the royal family, I ask that you allow %n% and myself to enter the Wrathborne Temple!"#M009100$Para Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"You want to enter the Wrathborne Temple? Why?"#M015010$Shashek$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Shashek about everything that has transpired.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"Is that so? Well, unfortunately, there is some... trouble at the Wrathborne Temple. Though... since both you and the Second Prince have passed my tests, I'll let you enter the Wrathborne Temple."#M015010$Shashek$1$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"At least I'll let you enter if you agree to help me."#M015010$Shashek$2$1#|
13354|You've decided to enter the Wrathborne Temple to see if the legends surrounding the Tear of Ares were true. Go find Shashek and ask his permission to enter the temple.|
13361|#&7$Shashek##br#
"After %n% helped me chase the rebels off, I found that the temple's seal had been damaged. Now the place is swarming with monsters." #M015010$Shashek$821$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"I had been planning to seal the temple completely and imprison the monsters inside it until I came up with a better plan." #M015010$Shashek$821$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"However, with the two of you here, maybe we can take the monsters on directly."#br##br#
#&53$Shashek hands an orb to Para Ryan.##M015010$Shashek$821$1#

#&7$Orb##br#
#&53$The orb glows strangely.##M404010$Orb$1$0#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"This orb is the key to repairing the seals. You'll need to take it to the deepest part of the temple and perform the sealing ritual."#M015010$Shashek$2$1#

#&7$Shashek##br#
"If you think you can do it, I'll allow you to enter the temple."#M015010$Shashek$2$1#

#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"Of course. We will restore the seal and eliminate the monsters. You have our word."#M009100$Para Ryan$822$0#|
13362|#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"%n%! I'm over here. Hurry!"#M009100$Para Ryan$821$1#|
13363|#&7$Para Ryan##br#
"I've been trapped by this strange magic. Can you get me out of here?"#br##br#
#&53$The Second Prince seems annoyed.##M009100$Para Ryan$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You try everything you can think of, but couldn't break the spell. It seems like it was meant to trap intruders. You shake your head at Para, letting him know you can't do anything here.##char$$821$0#|
13364|Shashek has allowed you to enter the temple, on the condition that you deal with the monsters inside and repair the seal.

Eliminate the monsters in the Wrathborne Temple and reach the seal. (Solo)|

"What bad luck... It looks like it's up to you now."#M009100$Para Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Orb##br#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"We're preparing to launch a counter-offensive, but we have to do something for the refugees first."#M127010$Lawrence$821$1#|

"Sorry. I reacted a little strongly. I was sent here from Navea."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"Me and my partner, Zachary, are in charge of protecting VIPs."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"Unfortunately, the person we were supposed to be protecting ran off to the village. Normally that wouldn't be a big problem but... Well, you've heard what happened. We've got a serious problem now."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$The refugee looks relieved to get a blanket. Seeing an opportunity, you ask about what happened at the village.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Frightened Victim##br#
"Thank you for doing this. Most of us couldn't salvage a thing."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Frightened Victim##br#
"I don't know why they would attack us! There's nothing of value anywhere in our village!"#npc$$821$1#

"I'm really worried about the people who weren't able to escape. I hope they're okay..." #npc$$828$1#|
13416|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you give the blanket to the refugee, she starts complaining.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Cold Victim##br#
"About time! I was literally freezing to death!"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Cold Victim##br#
"Things have been getting so much worse here! The forest used to be nice to place to live! Then the land started to lose its vitality, the temperature started to change, and now this!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You'd vaguely heard about the problems in the Oblitus Wood. You ask her what she knows about it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Cold Victim##br#
"I don't know anything about it. Everyone thinks its the dwarves and their confounded machines, though. Who knows what their crazy contraptions can do!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Cold Victim##br#
"Besides, they power those blasted things with the earth! It wouldn't be a surprise if it drained the land. Go see for yourself! There's some sort of walking metal thing near the Barren Well!"#npc$$827$1#|
13421|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Leonard for more details on the situation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"Lady Analisa came out here to deliver an Electromagnetic Turret and take care of some odd jobs around the fortress."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"If you're wondering why she did it herself, I think she might have been interested in some changes in the Oblitus Wood. She probably wanted to investigate what was going on herself."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Leonard that an assault is being planned on the village to rescue the captured villagers.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"I know. But they're far from ready."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"By the time they're ready to go, Analisa could be dead."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Leonard how you can help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"Well, my partner, Zachary already left to investigate Krok Village. It's pretty dangerous out there, though. Even if he rescues Lady Analisa, they could be ambushed by a monster on the way back."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"Think you could eliminate some of the Sasquacks around the area? That'll make things easier for him if he's on his way back."#npc$$821$1#|
13422|#&7$Leonard##br#
"The Dark Sasquacks are particularly dangerous, so try to deal with them first."#npc$$821$1#|
13423|#&7$Leonard##br#
"That was some good work! Hopefully Zachary comes back soon."#npc$$821$1#|
13424|Leonard hoped that you could help him rescue Lady Analisa, whom he suspects is trapped in Krok Village. First, he wants you to clear out the nearby Sasquacks to make things easier if Zachary and her are on their way back already.

"We don't have a choice: we need to take Krok Village back. I'm not sure we have enough strong warriors to manage this without a lot of casualties though."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"We need some medical supplies, but there isn't much in the fortress."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask how you can help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"The slime from Deadwood Snails actually has some powerful medicinal qualities. Smearing it on a wound will stop the bleeding and help it heal up."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"So, get us some slime!"#npc$$822$1#|
13432|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"It smells awful, but Deadwood Snail slime serves as a powerful medicine."#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$You give the slime to Lawrence.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"That looks like more than enough. At least I hope it'll be."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$According to Lawrence, the Varan are fierce fighters. They took Krok Village amazingly quickly. Oddly, it seemed like the refugees were mostly uninjured.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You express your concerns to Lawrence.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"We noticed that too. All of the injuries seem to be self-inflicted while escaping or from monster attacks while making it to the fortress."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"I really don't know what the Silverflash Tribe is up to."#npc$$825$1#|
13434|Lawrence is worried about the damage the soldiers will take while retaking Krok Village, especially given their lack of medical supplies. As a result, he asked you to collect some mucus from Deadwood Snails.

"Better than I'd expect. Analisa and several others are hiding near the village, being protected by a Makar warrior. The situation in the village at least seems stable."#npc$$829$1#

"Here though... I was asked to get these kids out of here, but the roads are more dangerous than I expected."#npc$$823$1#

#&53$You say that these stones were the only things in the carts. Zachary looks doubtful.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"There must be more to this. Perhaps some secrets are hidden inside the stones? I think, the only thing we can do is..."#M121010$Zachary$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$He is interrupted as a horrible roar erupts from the forest. The children look terrified.##char$$2$0#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"What's that?"#br##br#
#&53$Vincent asks in a trembling voice.##M001020$Vincent$821$0#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"Right, you're not from around here, are you %n%? Fury Mountain Wolves are ferocious predators. Usually they stick to livestock, but people have disappeared..."#br##br#
#&53$Zachary speaks quietly.##M121010$Zachary$821$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"It's not safe to leave the children here. We need to get them back to the fortress."#M121010$Zachary$821$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"I'm worried about what would happen if they followed us all the way back, though. There are warriors there, but there are also a lot of helpless villagers there too..."#M121010$Zachary$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You agree and say you'll deal with the wolves.##char$$821:0$0#

"Of course. Me and %n% are here."#br##br#
#&53$Zachary smiles as he speaks.##M121010$Zachary$823$1#

"Get going, %n%. And remember, if they catch up with us..."#M121010$Zachary$821$1#|

"Okay, children, does everyone have a bottle?"#br##br#
#&53$Zachary asks the children.##M121010$Zachary$821$1#

"Yes...but it smells really, REALLY bad."#M001020$Vincent$821$0#

"Good. Then smear it all over yourselves!"#M121010$Zachary$825$1#

"Eeeew! Do we have to?"#M002020$Ashley$823$0#

"Okay! Then I'll get the kids back to Nudak Fortress."#M121010$Zachary$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Odum here has been helping me out. While I was trying to help the villagers get out, the Varan spotted me. It was getting bad, then he helped me fight them off."#M142010$Analisa$821$1#

#&53$You tell Analisa about the Fulcheth Forest and the fact that the Silverflash Tribe is transporting stones from there to the village. You give her the stone.##char$$821$0#

"Interesting. I don't think I've seen any piles of stones in the village."#br##br#

#&53$No doubt about it: it is definitely the Third Prince.##M190010$Odum Ryan$822$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"After Mas- I mean, after you defeated me at the Alabastren Temple, I disbanded my guard and started wandering alone to hone my skills."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"I had planned on settling in Krok Village for a bit, but, when I got here, the Varan were everywhere! It was weird, so I decided to investigate."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#

"I mainly came out here help the Church transport the Electromagnetic Turret to the fortress."#M142010$Analisa$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"On the side, though, I was investigating the claims that the forest's natural energy seemed to be decreasing."#M142010$Analisa$821$1#

"Yep, like I suspected. Can you see how similar the stones and these fragments are?"#M142010$Analisa$821$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"Does that mean they're using the Fulcheth Forest Stones to summon the Earth Guards? Some of our tribe's witches possessed a similar ability."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"It's possible, but we need a little more information to prove it. I really need my tools..."#M142010$Analisa$828$1#|
13514|Analisa noticed a small amount of magical power on the stones, so she asked you to bring her some Earth Guard Fragments to research.

"%n%, can you get my Toolkit? We can also use this as an opportunity to survey Krok Village."#M142010$Analisa$821$1#

#&53$Analisa continues the conversation while she examines the stones and fragments.##M142010$Analisa$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

"They're already increasing their patrols. If our location is discovered, Analisa probably won't be able to finish her work."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#

"I think our best bet is to try and create a diversion, draw their attention somewhere else."#M190010$Odum Ryan$827$1#

"I know it's a lot to ask, but could you please attack the patrolling Varan? That'll draw their attention to you, at least."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#|

"We claim this village for the glory of the Silverflash Tribe! The words of the weak are meaningless."#M054010s85h+30$Shay$821$1#|
13573|#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
#&53$Odum calmly approaches Shay with the confidence expected of a prince.##M190010$Odum Ryan$3001$0#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
#&53$After reaching a respectful distance, Odum bows.##M190010$Odum Ryan$822$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"You are remarkably brave, young Makar. I witnessed your Human friend's display of strength - what is it that you really want of us?"#M054010s85h+30$Shay$1$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"With respect, honored Priest, I just wish you to hear me in this. Neither of us wants any needless deaths, I am certain. Here, read this and you will understand that despite our show of force, we seek peace!"#br##br#
#&53$Odum presents Analisa's Letter to the Varan Priest.##M190010$Odum Ryan$821$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"Hmph, deaths? Hardly even an injury have we inflicted upon the people here.  We are not here to harm you. We did all that we could to avoid such atrocities when we took the village."#br##br#
#&53$Thinking back to the reports, you do recall thinking it was odd that everyone escaped with barely a scratch.##M054010$Shay$$1$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"I know that you and your people just need access to the water from the pool. With this knowledge, I am hopeful that we can come to a peaceful agreement."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"Hmm...I see...Truly, you will let us use the water if we release the village back to the Humans?"#br##br#
#&53$After reading Analisa's letter, he looks doubtful.##M054010$Shay$2$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"Yes, it is all the truth, I swear on the whole of Makar. The people of the village have no problem sharing the water with you. All you needed to do...was ask."#M190010$Odum Ryan$822$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"Hmm, as you fought with honor, I expect you to also honor this pact. We have a deal."#M054010$Shay$2$1#|
13574|Playing the role of Odum, Analisa has entrusted you to make your way to the Varan Priest to deliver her letter of peace.

Defeat the Silverflash Guards and then try to negotiate with the Varan Priest, Shay.|
13581|#&7$Shay##br#
#&53$Judging by the expression on Shay's face, it seems he has been expecting you for quite a while.##M054010s85h+30$Shay$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You bow with respect to Varan Priest Shay as they prepare the Silverflash Ambassador to return with you to the fortress with your negotiation for peace. As you took a bit longer than expected to get here, you only introduce yourself briefly to the impatient looking Priest.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"So, you are the one who defeated the very best fighters of my tribe? Very impressive, Envoy of Gaia, I saw it all from safer grounds."#br##br#
#&53$Shay bows slightly and briefly looks at %p%, a flash of amazement flickers in his eyes.##M054010s85h+30$Shay$2$1#

#&7$Shay##br#
"On behalf of the Silverflash Tribe, I apologize for the unneeded terror we have caused. This water supply is crucial to the survival of our tribal leader, and we were desperate."#M054010$Shay$1001$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Surprised by this news of their tribal leader, you ask Shay to explain, concerned about what has happened.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"He is a powerful spell weaver, but his latest spell backfired and critically injured him. Only the pure energy of this pool seems to be helping his condition. Oblitus Wood used to be a place full of the Life Energy he needs, but that is changing, so this was our only hope."#M054010$Shay$1001$1#

#&7$Shay##br#
"In recent years, Oblitus Wood has been losing its vitality. It began in the northeast, and has continued to spread like a plague. Now the only uncontaminated water source is this lake in the southwest, which is why we sought it out."#M054010$Shay$2012$1#

#&7$Shay##br#
"As per our agreement, we will leave your village in peace in return for access to the water. As our esteemed leader will be using the pool frequently, however, we will be positioning Earth Guards nearby for his safety. They will be no threat to the people of the village, but we must always keep our eyes on our injured leader."#M054010$Shay$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Fully understanding the Silverflash Tribe's plight, you say you are ready to return to Nudak Fortress to finalize your peace talks.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"Come forth, Ambassador, and go with this brave Human to the fortress and express our Tribe's peaceful intentions." #M054010$Shay$1$1#

#&7$Silverflash Ambassador##br#
"It will be done, holy one."#br##br#
#&53$The Silverflash Ambassador nods to you that he is ready.##M053010s85h+30$Ambassador$52$0#|
13582|#&7$Carrick##br#
"I heard the Silverflash Ambassador was to meet with me. He couldn't have gotten lost, could he?"#npc$$821$1#|
13583|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Arriving with the Silverflash Ambassador, you see a very impatient Carrick tapping his foot.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"There you are! The Church Guard recently saw you enter Krok Village alone and then all reports ceased. What's been going on out there?!" #M128010$Carrick$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Face to face with the furious commander, you hastily explain what transpired in the village, emphasizing that everyone is safe and unharmed. The two races have reached a peaceful conclusion.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
#&53$Carrick furrows his brow now and then, lost in thought as he takes in the details of the events. He looks back and forth between you and the Silverflash Ambassador, remaining silent until your explanation is done.##M128010$Carrick$1$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I see. I will trust in Analisa's judgment, as we do not have time for unneeded conflict. We will honor our agreement and allow the Silverflash Tribe to use the water. We forgive what you have done, as no one was hurt. Let us have peace." #M128010$Carrick$822$1#

#&7$Silverflash Ambassador##br#
"Commander, in truth, you've made a wise decision this day. The Silverflash Tribe will retract all the warriors and make an offering of apology to the people. We never intended harm upon you, yet our previous actions were shameful." #M053010s85h+30$Ambassador$1$0#

#&7$Silverflash Ambassador##br#
"We are truly sorry for invading Krok Village. Until our leader recovers from his wounds, we will only use your water source - our people will leave Krok Village in peace." #M053010$Ambassador$1$0#|
13584|You have succeeded in reaching a peace agreement between Krok Village and the Silverflash Tribe. Priest Shay wishes you to accompany the Silverflash Ambassador back to Nudak Fortress so you can report the situation to the Fortress Commander, Carrick.

Take the Silverflash Tribe Ambassador to Nudak Fortress and report to Carrick.|
13591|#&7$Carrick##br#
#&53$The Silverflash Ambassador and other soldiers depart, leaving you alone with Carrick. He watches them go, then shifts his gaze to you.##M128010$Carrick$1$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I'm impressed by the peaceful resolution you have brought about from this crisis; I see why the Church believes in you!"#br##br#
#&53$With the tension over, Carrick's gruff attitude dissipates.##M128010$Carrick$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Relieved by Carrick's calmer disposition, you don't forget to mention that it wouldn't have been possible without Analisa and Odum.##char$$821:82$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"An honest one, aren't you? A rare find indeed. If you're willing to go the extra mile for Nudak Fortress, we have another issue that could use your expertise." #M128010$Carrick$828$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"According to the Silverflash Tribe, all the changes in Oblitus Wood started in the northeast. Now, the Dwarven village of Tafay is up there, so they could be prime suspects..." #M128010$Carrick$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Soon, we will send scouts to the north so they can assess the situation. We would like you on the case, however... There's a more pressing problem at hand that must be dealt with first." #M128010$Carrick$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Hordes of out of control robots have wreaked havoc at the Barren Well in the east. If left unchecked, I fear they will devastate our fortress. I've already sent some soldiers to address the issue, but...#M128010$ Carrick$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod to Carrick to continue, already prepared for what will come next.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Our forces at the Barren Well are vastly outnumbered, %n%. We could really use your assistance out there! You must travel to the northeastern side of the forest. There you may destroy as many robots as you can, and level the playing field for my soldiers."#M128010$Carrick$822$1#|
13592|#&7$Carrick##br#
"The robots are trying to approach the fortress! If you don't destroy as many as you can, I'm afraid the soldiers won't be able to hold them all off much longer, %n%."#npc$$821$1#|
13593|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You return to Carrick after eliminating the robots that were gathering around the northeastern side of the fortress and give him a rough estimate of the number of robots you saw.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"That many?! So it is true...my soldiers are having a rough time out there if the robots managed to break through the defenses" #M128010$Carrick$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"This is worse than I thought..."#br##br#
#&53$Carrick sighs, organizing his thoughts for his next order.##M128010$Carrick$828$1#|
13594|Carrick is worried that his soldiers are too few in number to handle the masses of rampaging robots. You have been charged with the task of thinning the numbers of metal monstrosities.

Defeat the Walkerbots and Cargobots near the Barren Well.|
13601|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"The commander must really trust you, huh? Hopefully he's not wrong. Since you're here to handle the robots anyway, perhaps you can make yourself doubly useful."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"While you're out there clashing with our enemies, could you also do me a favor? Our metal supplies are low, and I could really use some of those Robot Scraps for the forge."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"With those scraps, I'll be churning out new weapons and armors left and right! I need to get started with their preparation now, in case the war against The Shadow Knight does indeed begin."#npc$$821$1#|
13602|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"I can use as many Robot Scraps as you can carry, %n%! I need to get starting on the new equipment soon."#npc$$821$1#|
13603|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand all the Robot Scraps that you've collected over to Lawrence.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Wow, quite the haul you've got there. And of high quality to boot! The metals are slightly impure, but once treated properly they will make the finest equipment around." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"While you were gone, it seems the Commander has been recalling all active duty soldiers, except for the ones at the Barren Well, of course." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Obviously something is afoot, you ask Lawrence if he has any information.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"There has yet to be a direct order, but everyone already knows that we are going to start drilling for the battle against The Shadow Knight's demon army..." #npc$$821$1#|
13604|Quartermaster Lawrence has asked you to collect Robot Scraps as you will be destroying as many as you can for Fortress Commander Carrick. With these, he can craft new equipment for future battles.

Collect Robot Scraps from the Cargobots.|
13611|#&7$Carrick##br#
"These robots were all made by the Dwarves in the north. The Dwarves must be recklessly draining the land to make the darned things, and as a result, have depleted the Life Energy in Oblitus Wood. They must be stopped!" #M128010$Carrick$826$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I sent word to Navea's army for aid in eliminating these robots,  but instead, only Analisa arrived. She brought with her a strange device and claims it can destroy robots en masse." #M128010$Carrick$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$With the addition of this powerful weapon, you ask Carrick if there are any new plans.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"As you've seen, teams of robots have managed to break the defenses of the barren well, indicating that the squad out there is wildly outnumbered." #M128010$Carrick$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
#&53$Carrick sighs.##br##br#
"You know, %n%, when I heard you were coming to the fortress, I thought: what can an inexperienced %s% do to help at the front line?!" #M128010$Carrick$828$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Now I see that I was foolish to doubt you. You are perhaps our most valuable ally, and I would like to ask you for your assistance yet again." #M128010$Carrick$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Ready for anything, you let Carrick know that you will always fight at his side for Nudak Fortress.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Glad to hear it, %n%! Here's the first step to helping out the soldiers at the Barren Well: There are still some supplies in the fortress's storage room - take them to the barren well and give them to Walker, the Squad Leader in command. I suspect my troops sorely need a boost of supplies out there." #M128010$Carrick$821$1#|
13612|#&7$Walker##br#
"Robots! Robots everywhere! And no supplies to spare!"#npc$$828$1#|
13613|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Finally reaching the camp, you hand over the much needed supplies to Walker, and tell him that you are here to offer your aid in battle.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Finally! Supplies from the fortress! You are just one person, but we need all the help we can get against these blasted robots! It seems like a never-ending onslaught." #M121010$Walker$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Scoping out the area, you see the powerful Electromagnetic Turret brought by Analisa, and ask why it has not been used yet.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Oh, so you're familiar with our supposed trump card? This baby can fire powerful electromagnetic pulses that paralyze the robots' cores, but the problem is...."#br##br#
#&53$Walker whacks the machine.##M121010$Walker$827$1#

#&7$Walker##br#
"It needs quite a long time to recharge and it can't be interrupted once the process has begun. Even though the robots encroach closer and closer, the darn thing is always recharging; we still haven't been able to fire it once!" #M121010$Walker$821$1#

#&7$Electromagnetic Turret##br#
#&53$With the yet inoperable Electromagnetic Turret and the innumerable hordes of robots, it's no wonder the soldiers have been here so long!##M167010$Turret$1$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"The longer this takes the worse it gets for the soldiers."#h+70pet$$821$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"I really don't know if we can withstand the never-ending waves of robots while this thing charges. If these mindless robots alone cause us so much trouble, what will happen if we have to face The Shadow Knight's army? Right now, it feels impossible..." #M121010$Walker$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You place your hand on Walker's shoulder to comfort him. You know you must restore the soldiers' morale soon, or they might simply give up.##char$$828:0$0#|
13614|The squad facing off against the robot hoards must be low on supplies, so Carrick asked you to make a special delivery to the Squad Leader Walker.

Go get the supplies from the crate in the fortress and give them to Soldier Squad Leader Walker at the Barren Well.|
13621|#&7$Walker##br#
"Dash it all! We need this machine to work now! It's almost like an ocean of metal out there. A large group has already escaped from the Barren Well, past our defenses..." #M121010$Walker$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having taken care of those robots already, you tell Walker in hopes to put him at ease.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Really? Well at least there's some good news to be had. As we simply don't have enough soldiers out here, we've been doing our best to keep them contained to one area. When those robots broke through the defensive line, we still had to focus on maintaining our position and could not pursue them. We just don't have the resources out here!" #M121010$Walker$825$1#

#&7$Walker##br#
"These robots appeared at the same time Oblitus Wood began to wither. If we can't start thinning their numbers, we might not be able to wait until this thing finishes recharging." #M121010$Walker$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Understanding that the defense of the Electromagnetic Turret is the number one priority, you offer to assist the soldiers by destroying as many robots as you can.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Thanks for the assist, %n%. While we're on guard here, do what you can to thin the Bouncer robots' numbers." #M121010$Walker$826$1#|
13622|#&7$Walker##br#
"If we fail to drive back the Robots, we may be overrun before this device is fully charged."#npc$$821$1#|
13623|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Returning victorious, you tell Walker that you've defeated as many of the Bouncer robots as you could.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Yes, I saw everything from here. Nice moves out there! I'm impressed, %n%, your skills far surpass any of ours; with your assistance, we should be able to hold out until this thing is fully charged!" #M121010$Walker$822$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"No time for celebration!" #br##br#
#&53$%p% exclaimed suddenly, looking towards the mound of robots you had just defeated.##h+70pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You and Walker turn around to see what %p% is staring at. Slowly, the Robots you thought had been defeated were beginning to rise; even with their outer armor in horrible condition, they seem to be back in working order.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"No...this can't be!" #M121010$Walker$829$1#|
13624|Your reputation precedes you, and Walker knows how skilled you are, so he's asked you to destroy the robots near the barren well.

"This is awful!#br#
@How are we going to stop these robots?#br#
@Destroying their shells isn't enough!"#M121010$Walker$828$1#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Maybe we could remove their cores?#br#
@Not that that's any easier..."#br#
@Walker looks at you hopefully. #M121010$Walker$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@After a moment of thought, #br#
@you ask Walker how to remove the cores and#br#
@stop them from moving.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"It is pretty tough.#br#
@I don't think anyone but you could do it."#br#
@Walkers gives you a tool that reminds you of a door handle.#M121010$Walker$828$1#

#&7$Walker##br#
"First you have to destroy their shell and expose the core.#br#
@Once you do that,#br#
@you just extract the core and they're done!"#M121010$Walker$828$1#|
13632|#&7$Walker##br#
"Hurry and remove the Robots' cores now! It's the only way to stop them from reanimating!"#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$You return from your core removal mission, carrying as many cores as you could handle.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Nice work. These Robots are finally a safe pile of scrap metal. Now we just have to wait for this device to be fully charged, and we can destroy them all..."#M121010$Walker$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Despite your efforts, Walker still looks very stressed. Concerned, you kindly ask him what the matter is.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"%n%, we've sent a whole squad into battle at the barren well who are supposed to report on the state of the battle at fixed times. However, their latest report has yet to come in...." #M121010$Walker$829$1#|
13634|Walker mentioned that the only way to stop the robots permanently is to remove their cores, so you agreed to take the tool he provided and remove the cores from damaged robots.

Use the Removal Tool on the damaged Berserker Bouncers and Ballistic Bouncers.|
13641|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Trying to keep Walker focused, you ask about the status of the Electromagnetic Turret and for any previous reports from the missing squad.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Hmm, the device...let's see...Ah! Thanks to you, the recharge is progressing more quickly than hoped! I believe it will be ready shortly."#M121010$Walker$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, indicating that he should continue speaking.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"As for the squad, in their last report they said that they had been overwhelmed by Butterfly Hoplites soaring above the Barren Well. Being ambushed like that from above...no wonder they haven't had a chance to report yet. They must be overrun!" #M121010$Walker$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Butterfly Hoplites are exceedingly fast, there's no way the soldiers will be able to retreat from the onslaught." #br##br#
#&53$%p% looks at you expectantly.##pet$$821$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Who knows how long reinforcements would take to arrive, what do you suggest, %n%?" #M121010$Walker$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You believe that it is unlikely reinforcements will arrive in a reasonable amount of time. The only solution you see is for you to go alone to the Barren Well and assess the situation. Walker and the others should continue to guard the Electromagnetic Turret until it is fully recharged.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"We will be eternally grateful, %n%. Be careful out there!"#br##br#
#&53$Walker salutes you with respect.##M121010$Walker$822$1#|

"Hurry, go defeat the Butterfly Hoplites in the south! I'm not sure what will become of our soldiers without your aid. They need to be rescued!"#npc$$821$1#|
13643|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you are returning from battle, you see Walker waving at you excitedly back at camp.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Walker##br#
"You. Are. Amazing! %n%, you did it! You saved them all! As soon as the first of the soldiers returned, they told me all that you'd done out there!" #br##br#
#&53$Walker looks extremely grateful.##M121010$Walker$825$1#

#&7$Walker##br#
"What's more, while you were gallantly rescuing our soldiers, the turret has finally reached full charge! It's ready to fire whenever we're ready!" #M121010$Walker$821$1#

#&7$Walker##br#
"Once our technician confirms that all systems are go, we'll end this once and for all. Let's take down these Robots!" #M121010$Walker$821$1#|

13664|Having taken care of the robot infestation, Walker and his soldiers returned to the forest. He told you that if you wanted to continue investigating, you should head towards Tafay Village and look for a scout named Vincent.

"Though the thorn's poison doesn't kill you instantly, there are a lot of hungry lizards in the forest. So if people get poisoned and fully paralyzed, they will be easy pickings for the lizards." #M121011h+55$Vincent$501$1#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"%n%, what's your opinion on this situation: If the decay of Oblitus Wood is in fact caused by the Dwarves of Tafay Village, then Nudak Fortress will have to begin a potentially grueling negotiation process.

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You agree with Vincent. If, indeed, the withering of Oblitus Wood is caused by Dwarves, then Nudak Fortress could potentially have to resort to force against the Dwarven village. However, you say you would like to avoid such an attack if possible.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"Whatever choice we make, our army will be passing this way when the time comes. The Forest of Thorns is a maze of Poisonous Vines. Only the Dwarven robots and lizards can wander through unharmed.

"There was something...While I was scouting out Tafay Village, I heard a lot of arguing within the walls. I tried to get a better look inside, but was attacked by the Tafay Bouncers.

"A noble endeavor indeed, %n%. You've done so much for our village. If our Chief were here, I know he'd agree with me: Tafay Village would pledge its services in the fight against The Shadow Knight, for the good of all our lands."#M052011$Dolan$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Curious about this overzealous leader, you ask about why Chief Tobin is so passionately leading his villagers in the dangerous quest for a new energy source.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dolan##br#
"Village Chief Tobin succeeded his father a few years ago and became the youngest Village Chief of Tafay Village. He's passionate and full of ambition. However, he's a little rash. Perhaps...he's too eager to prove himself to his people."#M052011$Dolan$2$1#|

"When Oblitus Wood started to wither, one of our instruments detected a new energy signal in the east towards Ghostweep Ruins. Despite my pleas for him call off the expedition, the stress of our energy crisis took hold of him and he lead the youths in the village there to mine this new energy."#M052011s85h+70$Dolan$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$If new energy really exists, is this not a good thing? As you ponder this, you ask Dolan to explain his reasoning for opposing the operation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dolan##br#
"It's true that we've detected some energy signals from Ghostweep Ruins in the east, but our readings suggest it is quite unstable. It's hard to say at the moment if it's even dangerous, as it usually takes years of research and experimentation before we decide to mine a new source."#M052011$Dolan$821$1#

#&7$Dolan##br#
"But Chief Tobin is acting out of desperation. Without any new energy, Oblitus Wood and Tafay Village can't survive for very long."#M052011$Dolan$828$1#

#&7$Dolan##br#
"I appreciate that he wants to save our kind, but I am still against his decision. Always comparing himself to his father, he is blinded with the need to prove his worth as a new leader. Maybe, just maybe, if an outsider weighs in on the dangers, he will open his eyes."#M052011$Dolan$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Seeing how hopeful Dolan is as he looks at you, you are compelled to ask him what you should do to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dolan##br#
"The village itself is safe for now; it's our villagers who need saving at the moment. Please, stop our Village Chief's operation at Ghostweep Ruins, and tell them to return before we feel the effects of that corrupt energy source."#M052011$Dolan$2$1#

"Just as I thought, the energy here is dangerously unstable. It's quite similar to the energy signals I recorded when I inspected the robots gathering at the Barren Well. There must be some kind of connection, perhaps underground, between Ghostweep Ruins and the Well."#M050051$Alvin$821$1#

#&7$Alvin##br#

#&53$Returning from your encounter with Chief Tobin, you tell Shaine that he snatched the Bright Light from you and took off further into the cave.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Shaine##br#
"No! This is a disaster!"#M050011$Shaine$823$1#|
13844|Shaine asked you to take the Bright Light into the Ghostweep Cave and look for the Village Chief, Tobin.

Enter the cave and find out what's going on with Tobin.|
13851|#&7$Shaine##br#
"My past experiences have never covered something like this - this whole situation is way over my head." #br##br#
#&53$Shaine, while worried, sounds slightly less panicked.##M050011s85h+70$Shaine$829$1#

#&7$Shaine##br#
"I don't know what else to do for our Chief...I should lead the others back now and report to the Elder. I wish I didn't have to leave him, but it's just too dangerous in that cave." #M050011$Shaine$827$1#

#&7$Shaine##br#
"After I apprise the other militia leaders of the situation, we're going to head back to Tafay Village to ask the Elder what we should do about next." #M050011$Shaine$1$1#

#&7$Shaine##br#
"Oh yea, I almost forgot! Alvin told me to let you know that he's discovered something peculiar about those crystals. You should go see what he has to say about them."#M050011$Shaine$$821$1#|
13852|#&7$Alvin##br#
"......."#M050051s85h+70$Alvin$821$1#|
13853|#&7$Alvin##br#
"Oh, There you are! I've been looking all over for you. I discovered some critical information about these crystals, and I thought you should know as soon as possible." #M050051s85h+70$Alvin$821$1#

#&7$Alvin##br#
"The energy on the crystals is reminiscent of Life Energy, but it looks like it has been corrupted in some way. If I guess correctly, those zombies are what is draining the Oblitus Wood of its vitality, in a similar way that we Dwarves also draw our life force from the spirit of the forest."#M050051$Alvin$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You realize that, like an Envoy draws in the Power of Gaia to produce an Eidolon, so to do the Dwarves absorb the essence of nature, perhaps fueling their great skill with machinery. For some reason, this connection gives you a bad feeling...##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Alvin##br#
"You see, the zombies absorb the forest's Life Energy, sapping it directly out of Oblitus Wood. This is what is causing it to wither and decay. This unusual energy we see here is emitted from these zombies after they absorb the pure Life Energy." #M050051$Alvin$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$By now you are familiar with the strange, powerful energy tingling in the air, and gasp as you realize there must be many more powerful zombies hidden in the depths of the Ghostweep Cave.##char$$823:0$0#|
13854|Shaine told you that Alvin has discovered something interesting about the crystals you found and suggested that you go talk to him.

Talk to the Energy Inspector, Alvin.|
13861|#&7$Alvin##br#
"From the amount of energy residue on the crystals, I suspect that it takes quite a lot of these zombies to have such a resounding effect on nature. I think there must be many more powerful zombies inside the Ghostweep Cave itself." #M050051s85h+70$Alvin$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Alvin that Chief Tobin recently stole your Bright Light and ran deep into the Ghostweep Cave, alone...##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alvin##br#
"If this is true, the Village Chief is in extreme danger right now. There's no way he's strong enough to deal with the plethora of powerful monsters inside on his own." #M050051$Alvin$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you have already promised, you tell Alvin that not only are you here to investigate the cause of the corruption, you also believe you are the only one who can rescue their Chief from the Ghostweep Cave. You ask Alvin to report to Nudak Fortress the true reason of Oblitus Wood's decay.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alvin##br#
"I will go to Nudak Fortress, but...%n%, do you really intend to go in there alone?!"#br##br#
#&53$Alvin looks up at you nervously.##M050051$Alvin$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Alvin that it is your mission to discover what is going on within the Oblitus Wood. Now that Chief Tobin is also in danger, you don't have time to wait for reinforcements and must act immediately!##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Alvin##br#
"But..."#M050051$Alvin$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You look sternly but kindly at Alvin and tell him that it would be best if he were to go quickly to Nudak Fortress to report to either Commander Carrick or Knight Blacksmith Analisa. They will know what to do and who to send for backup.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Alvin##br#
"You are a brave soul, %n%. You truly are our only hope at bringing our Chief back alive. I will travel to Nudak Fortress to deliver this information. You...Be careful, friend." #M050051$Alvin$822$1#|
13862|#&7$Tobin##br#
"......."#M051021s85h+70$Tobin$1$1#|
13863|#&7$Tobin##br#
"You... Were you sent to rescue me? I can't go yet, can't you see? These monsters cannot stop me from saving my village! Nothing can stop me from saving my village! I must find energy! I must save Oblitus Wood!"#br##br#
#&53$Tobin's voice is shaking with fear, yet he still seems determined to find a new source of energy.##M051021s85h+70$Tobin$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Concerned about Tobin's delirious manner and ranting about energy, you still feel the need to tell him that these zombies have been the cause for the withering of the forest.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tobin##br#
"It's..so..dark in here. Dark! So many monsters..I almost gave up. Can you believe it?! But you've just confirmed it! I knew it was these, these things ruining my home!" #M051021$Tobin$821$1#

#&7$Tobin##br#
"You think I will just leave?! I must persevere! For the good of my people, my village, my land!" #M051021$Tobin$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Driven to the brink of madness by the love of his people, you can tell that Tobin would sacrifice his life for them...##char$$821$0#|
13864|Alvin said that there must be many more powerful zombies in the cave. The Village Chief wandered in there alone and is probably in grave danger, so he asked you to enter Ghostweep Cave and save him.

Enter Ghostweep Cave and find the Village Chief.|
13871|#&7$Tobin##br#
"For my people!...For Tafay!..."#M051021s85h+70$Tobin$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Tobin is in no condition to take on the zombies of Ghostweep Cave. You ask him to tell you what he's discovered and hope that he'll let you take it from here.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tobin##br#
"...You...You!"#br##br#
#&53$Tobin Sighs.##br##br#
"You're...right. I cannot do this thing. I will accept your help...for the sake of Tafay Village."#M051021$Tobin$823$1#

#&7$Tobin##br#
"My apologies for how I treated you when we first met, I was out of my mind. If you had not come searching for me, I would have continued deeper and deeper into madness. I'm certain you've saved me from death."#M051021$Tobin$822$1#

#&7$Tobin##br#
"I've discovered that the energy signal is being emitted from deep within the cave, probably from a very powerful...zombie, you called them? I advise you to seek it out, and end this."#M051021$Tobin$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Gravely, you nod to Tobin and tell him that you will not fail. You mention that his villagers are already returning home, and anxiously await his safe arrival.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Tobin##br#
"Before I go...what is your name, brave Envoy of Gaia?"#M051021$Tobin$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A bit surprised that he knew of your status as an Envoy, you give him your name.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tobin##br#
"Thank you, %n%. Be safe."#M051021$Tobin$822$1#|
13872|#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"......"#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#|
13873|#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"It may seem dangerous, but that is all the more reason to fight with you!"#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"When the monsters absorbing the Life Energy of the forest are defeated, the land will begin to recover. After a while, the balance will be renewed as before. Of this, I am certain."#M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#|
13874|Tobin believes that a powerful monster in the cave has to be eliminated in order to heal the Oblitus Wood.

Conquer the zombies infesting Ghostweep Cave (Instance) and free Oblitus Wood from its corruption!|
13881|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Not expecting company, you wave to Odum and ask what the situation is. Is there some emergency, perhaps?##char$$821:82$0#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"Analisa and I were walking back to the fortress when this speedy Dwarf came charging past us! We decided that was rather suspicious, so we stopped him and asked what was going on. He told us a brave human was going into Ghostweep Cave alone!" #M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"My friend, I knew it would be you I'd find!"#M190010$Odum Ryan$825$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"When I got to the fortress, I grabbed anyone available who could help and rushed back out here. You can't do everything on your own, %n%, leave some for the rest of us!" #M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
#&53$With a twinkle in her eye, Analisa beams at Odum's show of loyalty.##br##br#
"Odum, you're always so thoughtful of others, and I can see you care deeply for our lands. Tell me, would you consider joining the Church?" #M142010$Analisa$821$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"A talent like yours would be crucial to the success in our upcoming battle. Wouldn't you agree, %n%? We would be honored to have you as one of our Templars."#M142010$Analisa$825$0#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"Me? A Templar? I never thought...But...I'm not sure I'm ready to join just yet. I feel I am not yet finished honing my skills as a warrior. When I'm ready, I'll forever be at your side!" #M190010$Odum Ryan$828$1#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"%n%, you should head back to the fortress and tell the commander what's what. I'll hang back here and pick off any zombie stragglers. Hurry, spread the good news: Oblitus Wood is saved!" #M190010$Odum Ryan$821$1#|
13882|#&7$Carrick##br#
"......." #npc$$821$1#|
13883|#&7$Carrick##br#
"You're finally back! I heard that you delved into Ghostweep Cave on you own. That was a brave move! I was quite concerned, %n%."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the commander about the plight of the Dwarves in the north, and how you managed to solve the zombie problem in the cave.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I can hardly believe it...zombies! Without you, who knows what would happen to our home. You're a true hero! On behalf of all residents of Oblitus Wood, we heartily thank you!"#br##br#
#&53$Carrick salutes you with a new-found, deep respect.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Even though Oblitus Wood still needs a lot of time to recover, at least we have a hope now. I look forward to the day in which Oblitus Wood will be restored to its former glory."#npc$$821$1#|
13884|Odum asks you to return to the fortress and inform the commander that the zombies in Ghostweep Cave have been eliminated.

Report to the Fortress Commander, Carrick.|
13891|#&7$Carrick##br#
"You've been such a great aid in the recovery of Oblitus Wood. We will do our best to help you in your endeavors. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"With this problem solved, you have lifted everyone's spirits; they are all preparing for the coming war. That this whole situation was resolved by a single person is a truly inspiring feat."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You blush slightly, embarrassed at all the praise being showered upon you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"You must inform the Church of our new allies. All residents in Oblitus Wood, including the Silverflash Tribe and the Dwarves in Tafay Village, are ready and willing to help the Church fight against The Shadow Knight's army."#npc$$821$1#|
13892|#&7$Belenus##br#
"May I be of assistance, young one?"#M118010$Belenus$822$1#|
13893|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to the Grand Bishop how you rallied all the inhabitants of Oblitus Wood. They are united against the The Shadow Knight. You also describe the dire situation of the zombies from Ghostweep Cave.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"You have done good work, %n%, and I am glad. We could not have known that the zombies were the cause for the energy corruption of the forest." #M118010$Belenus$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Remembering the strange behaviors of the zombies, you tell the Grand Bishop that the zombies of Ghostweep Cave seem to be well organized. You explain that you have experience the risen dead before, and have never seen such behavior.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
#&53$The Grand Bishop turns to his Guard Officer.##br##br#
"Gus, you are most knowledgeable in this. Please explain."#M118010$Belenus$822$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Certainly, Grand Bishop."#M135010$Gus$822$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"%n%, we have records from the past recounted by another Envoy of Gaia of zombies such as these. They are fallen Envoys... It is true that, occasionally, a zombie of an Envoy maintains the capacity of thought."#M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"However, we do not know if the memories and thoughts preserved in the zombies are from its original human form, or if the creature is possessed by another consciousness."#M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"These Envoys were consumed by their Eidolons that had grown most powerful... I see that your own Eidolon's ability has increased greatly, perhaps soon to reach its peak..."#br##br#
#&53$Gus looks at %p% beside you.##M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"I worry that if your Eidolon grows even more powerful, it could break your bond and turn on you. I'm not certain what would happen in this situation, but it could result in your death. Please bear that in mind..." #M135010$Gus$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, Gus's words making you a little worried. You and your Eidolon have become fast friends, however, and you trust each other fully.##char$$806:0$0#|
13894|Carrick asked you to inform the Church that the residents of the Oblitus Wood are willing to stand up and fight against The Shadow Knight's army.

Travel to Navea and report to the Grand Bishop of the Church.|
13901|#&7$Ben##br#
"I overheard your chat with Hayes. So you want to become a mercenary, huh? Think it's good money, don't you? Hmm...alright! It's your lucky day, you're in!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It seems he has totally misunderstood why you're here, but you decide it would be a good chance to get to know the Sanknie Alliance from the inside. Under the guise of mercenary, you begin your investigation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ben##br#
"The name's Ben. I am a Divisional Guard Captain of the Sanknie Alliance. You will be following MY orders for the next few days."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Your first task is simple enough. Head inside the camp first and ask around to get the status of our affairs. We have a bad situation going on and I don't have the time to hold your hand!"#npc$$821$1#|
13902|#&7$Ben##br#
"They haven't even completed most preliminary of tasks...If we can't accomplish anything out here...."#br#
#&53$Ben mumbles, distracted.##npc$$821$1#|
13903|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report back to Ben about what you discovered from others around camp: Funding cuts, lack of supply shipments, and even vicious bandits.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Don't you think I know all of this?! I just wanted to avoid having to explain it to you! The research being conducted out here is taking too long so our resources are being pulled!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Headquarters hasn't been able to send us as many guards lately, so we've had to rely on mercenaries. Some of them though... worthless."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Anyway, no time for chatting. You now know all that you need to. Get to work!" #npc$$821$1#|
13904|Ben thought you wanted to become a money grubbing mercenary.  They need more guards at the moment so you were accepted immediately. For your first task, Ben tells you to meet with people in the camp and get to know the situation from them.|
13905|#&7$Maxim##br#
"So you're the new rookie, eh? Ben must be sending you around so he doesn't have to tell you himself what's going on."#br##br#
#&53$The pale-faced man sighs.##M125020$Maxim$821$1#

#&7$Maxim##br#
"The name's Maxim - leader of the Second Expedition Team. There are only two expedition teams remaining in the Oasis...I'm ashamed to say it, but my team's been suspended for the time being as most of our members have suffered injury from the latest attacks."#M125020$Maxim$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You notice that Maxim is covered in scars and bandages; he's clearly seen better days.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Maxim##br#
"Me and my team were recently attacked by a large group of Sand Owl Bandits... In the fight we lost many of our belongings and sustained many injuries. The bandits even managed to make off with a very important map..."#M125020$Maxim$821$1#

#&7$Second Expedition Member##br#
"Don't talk like that, captain! We all know that you tried your best. We were simply overrun!"#M123020$Second Expedition Member$827$0#

#&7$Second Expedition Member##br#
"Exactly! We're a group of archaeologists! Now we're not only attacked by desert creatures, but have to deal with these tough Sand Owl Bandits as well..."#M123020$Second Expedition Member$826$1#

#&7$Second Expedition Member##br#
"The Sand Owl bandits are getting increasingly aggressive, and we're really quite helpless on our own. Usually the expedition teams are to be protected by guards sent from the Sanknie Alliance, but, due to budget cuts, they can't afford to send the usual guard force here. We're receiving less and less support."#M123020$Second Expedition Member$821$0#

#&7$Maxim##br#
"It's all true, what they've said. But if you think we're upset, you haven't dealt with Hayes much. He's our Project Director. He's taking the reduced funding for his program very badly."#M125020$Maxim$828$1#|
13906|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You approach the head of the medical supply team of the Sanknie Alliance, hoping to hear what she has to say about the situation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Oh dear, nearly all our supplies have been stolen by those bandits...What's left will only support us for a few more days..." #br##br#
#&53$Camilla mumbles to herself and paces back and forth, checking her list.##M115030$Camilla$828$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Not too long ago, the Second Expedition Team was brutally attacked by the bandits. Nearly all of our supplies were pillaged and many have been injured! Those villainous bandits even stoop so low as to poison their blades!"#M115030$Camilla$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask why the Sanknie Alliance decided to set up a branch here. It seems to be quite dangerous in the Star Sand Desert.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say, but it is in relation to a certain project we're undertaking."#M115030$Camilla$823$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"It wasn't too rough out here initially, but back then we had ample financial support and aid from the Sanknie Alliance headquarters. With reduced funding, all sorts of problems pop up constantly!"#M115030$Camilla$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"We didn't used to have to rely on mercenary help as the guards sent from headquarters could circle the entire oasis. Now we can only afford the most inexpensive of mercenaries..."#M115030$Camilla$825$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"I don't mean to offend you, but around here our mercenaries don't have a good reputation... If Hayes had his way, he'd dismiss the lot of you."#M115030$Camilla$821$1#|
13911|#&7$Ben##br#
"After the latest raid by the Sand Owl Bandits, Project Director Hayes has been scrutinizing our security efficiency. He didn't say anything. That's how I know he's unhappy with our work around here." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"The bandits sound like a big deal, and our diminished numbers certainly don't help, but right now our biggest threat is the group of raging Moas outside of camp."#br##br#
#&53$Ben lets out a long sigh.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"During the bandit raid we charged through the Moa's dwelling. We thought the things were pretty harmless, but after messing up their nesting grounds...well, they certainly seem to want to exact revenge upon us!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"No time for simple rookie tasks, here's your first mission: Fend off the Moas and prevent them from destroying camp. Don't want to Hayes to keep lookin' at me like that..."#br##br#
#&53$Ben shivers in his boots.##npc$$821$1#|
13912|#&7$Ben##br#
"If those Moas rush into the camp, they may destroy some of our precious research instruments. Hayes would be furious!"#npc$$821$1#|
13913|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having dealt with the Moa situation, you return to Ben and give your report.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Finally, someone who can accomplish things around here! Tell me your name, rookie."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After introducing yourself to Ben, you inquire about the Sand Owl Bandit situation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Ben##br#
#&53$Ben lets out another sigh.##br##br#
"Well, they started out as just a small group, nothing to worry about. Only stole a few things that we could easily replace. But now... they have a new leader who is leading them in a more aggressive manner."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Their latest wave of attacks have cost us dearly, both in supplies and in capable fighters. You should talk to Camilla, she might have something for you to do to help our injured."#npc$$821$1#|
13914|While dealing with a bandit raid, the expedition team trampled the Moas' territory. The furious Moas might destroy research instruments and data if they assault the Oasis, so Ben requests that you to help fend them off.|

#&53$You walk up to Camilla, a little unsure of what you should ask her about.##char$$821$0#

"Hey there, you're the rookie, right? I'm Camilla from the medical supply team, I think I spoke to you earlier...Do you think you can help me out?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, ready to help out Camilla during these stressful times.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"We lost many of our pack animals when we were attacked. Currently, we've been relying on manpower to move our supplies and they're not very efficient! I can hardly find volunteers to help out anymore, either...."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"I overheard what the captain told you to do with the Moas. Do you think you could manage to wrangle some of the Moas outside camp? If I can train them to carry our supplies, things would be much easier out here!"#npc$$821$1#|
13922|#&7$Camilla##br#
"You're the only rookie we've had for months, so I understand that you're quite busy...I hope you can spare the time to help me out."#npc$$821$1#|

#&53$With some effort you manage to pull the Moa over to Camilla and hand her the rope.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Captured Moa##br#
#&53$The moa stands up tall and ruffles its feathers, striking an offensive posture while fighting the rope. Even though it's under great strain, the rope holds the large bird in place.##M089030s75h-20$Captured Moa$1120$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Wow! I knew they looked strong, but this is amazing! Certainly it can be trained to help us out around here. Birds are pretty smart, you know!"#br##br#
#&53$Camilla examines the captured moa and looks quite impressed.##M115030$Camilla$823$1#

"It's hard to find tameable animals in a desert such as this. If you're short on gold, your ostrich could fetch a high price out here..."#br##br#
#&53$Camilla looks at Beebis, trying not to stare.##M115030$Camilla$821$1#

#&53$You put a stop to Camilla's thoughts immediately, telling her that Beebis has been travelling alongside you for too long to even consider selling for any reason.##char$$807:72$0#

"Ok, ok! Relax, I just thought I'd ask. I'll concentrate my efforts on taking good care of this moa here. Hopefully I'll train it right! Here, take this with my thanks."#br##br#
#&53$Camilla hands you a few coins from her purse.##M115030$Camilla$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"You are the kindest mercenary I've ever met. You don't slack off, either!"#br##br#
#&53$Camilla is glad for your assistance and gives you a warm thank you.##M115030$Camilla$821$1#|
13924|Camilla overheard that you were tasked with driving off angry Moas. She took this opportunity to ask you to capture some Moas with a rope so that they could be trained to carry the supplies.|
13931|#&7$Camilla##br#
"Those Sand Owl Bandits are big threat around here. If one of them wounds you, the toxins they use sap your strength so you can no longer fight."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Camilla what the full effects of the venom are and what kind of poison the Bandits use.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"They use the venom from the Curly-Tailed Chameleon. Once you get poisoned, you lose all your strength and can't stop shivering."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"But don't worry, I'm great with medicine! In fact, I've already discovered the antidote. However the patients need something nutritious to regain their strength fully."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Moa Eggs are packed with nutrients and will be perfect to help the patients' recovery. Please, can you collect some for them?"#npc$$821$1#|
13932|#&7$Camilla##br#
"We really have to fend for ourselves out here lately; headquarters is no longer offering us extra support."#br##br#
#&53$Camilla sighs helplessly.##npc$$821$1#|
13933|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Camilla the large Moa Eggs that you've collected.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Thank goodness! These are just what the doctor ordered!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"My patients and I thank you for your help! Without you, I'd have to try to collect these eggs on my own...and I'm not fit for combat at all!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Camilla what's been going on between the Sanknie Alliance's project and the Sand Owl Bandits. People are always mumbling about some current "project" or "research," but nobody seems to want to talk about it, so you think it's best to start with the bandits.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"We launched this project here in the desert, and the Sand Owl Bandits have always kept an eye on us. They seemed to be planning something, like they were stalking us, but they didn't make a move for a few years."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"When they started to rob us, they only took a few supplies and ran because they couldn't stand up to our guards. Sigh... Since the guards sent from Headquarters left us, the Sand Owl Bandits are becoming more and more aggressive..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Lately, it seems that the bandits have gained a new leader and their group has drastically increased in numbers. This is when we would really need the Sanknie guards most, but they are being withdrawn because our work here isn't proceeding as headquarters would like..."#npc$$828$1#|
13934|Many people were poisoned by the Sand Owl Bandit's in a previous attack. Although they are now recovering thanks to Camilla's antidote, they need nutritious food to regain their strength. Camilla would be very thankful if you could collect Moa Eggs for her.|
13941|#&7$Camilla##br#
"You ask a lot of questions about those Sand Owl Bandits...What's got you so interested about them?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Camilla that you like to study your opponents techniques so that you can gain the advantage while fighting against them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"I see! I heard from some of the guards that the Sand Owl Bandits are sending scouts to observe us as well. They must be trying to find out when our next expedition is..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"I think I heard that the guards have seen them to the east of Palmgil Oasis..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You and %p% nod and tell Camilla that you will go investigate the problem.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"%n%, are you sure you can take them on alone? If you do manage it, Ben will certainly be thankful! Whatever the results, please report back and let him know what's going on." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Please, be careful!"#br##br#
#&53$Camilla looks quite worried.##npc$$821$1#|
13942|#&7$Ben##br#
"How should we deal with these conniving bandits..."#br##br#
#&53$Ben furrows his brow and looks lost in thought.##npc$$821$1#|
13943|#&7$%n%##br#
After taking care of the Sand Owl Bandits spying on Palmgil Oasis, you report back and tell Ben what you have done.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ben##br#
"What? You really defeated all the bandits on your own?! Are you really that good of a fighter?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$Those bandit spies were easy peasy for us! We could fight them off all day!##pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Worried that %p%'s bragging will annoy Ben, you try to interrupt, but before you do so you notice a smile spreading across Ben's face.##char$$821:80$0#

#&7$Ben##br#
"You've been one surprise after another, %n%. Compared to other mercenaries I've hired, you seem too good to be true!"#npc$$821$1#|
13944|Camilla overheard the guards talking about some bandit scouts outside the oasis, probably trying to find out the time of the next expedition. Ben is quite worried about what to do, so you decide to check it out and defeat any bandit scouts you find there.|
13951|#&7$Ben##br#
"With someone like you around, we may be able to send you as backup for our mercenaries in the field."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"Here's what you'll be getting yourself into: I've deployed a troop of mercenaries to handle the Sand Owl Bandit situation. They're not the best mercenaries I've seen, actually quite useless, but that's no reason to just leave them there without backup."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"I want you to head out there and give them a hand. While you're at it, maybe you can also eliminate the whole Sand Owl Group! Ha! If you can accomplish this, Hayes may hire you on as a full member of the division."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ben##br#
"I'll tell supply clerk what's-her-name to prepare some supplies for you and the other mercenaries.#br#
...What are you standing around for, move out!"#npc$$821$1#|
13952|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"If I knew how many bandits were out here, I never would have left..."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah shakes her head helplessly.##npc$$828$1#|
13953|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$When you approach Phaelah and her men, you notice her giving you a very suspicious look. You sense that, had you not had your weapon put away, you could have been attacked!##char$$828:80$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Are you a bandit? Hmm, if you were, I'm pretty sure we'd be fighting. Oh, so you're one of us!...Wait, I've never seen you around anywhere...Uh...Who are you?"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah looks completely frazzled and you worry about her mental state.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Phaelah that the captain sent you to help them out as well as bring fresh supplies.##char$$821$0#|
13954|After realizing how talented a fighter you are, Ben's asked you to bring supplies to the mercenaries in the field. If there's a chance to eliminate the bandits, go all out to defeat them all!|
13955|#&7$Camilla##br#
"%n%, hey! Over here!"#br##br#
#&53$Camilla gives you a pack of heavy goods.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Ben asked me to make this ready for you. Please deliver it to those poor, weak mercenaries out there."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Hehe...if you can help complete our "Star Plan", you will be wealthy beyond your wildest dreams..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"...Oh! Er, what did I just say? I, uh, didn't say anything, right? Really, I didn't! You didn't hear anything!"#br##br#
#&53$Camilla vehemently denies what she has just said.##npc$$821$1#|
13961|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Even though they've sent just one person, it's better than no one at all."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah tries to be positive.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"We just defeated a patrolman from the Bandit Group. A small victory, but it's a start! We were about to move forward to Sand Owl Camp, but a group of Sandy Armordillos is blocking our way."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah points out the Sandy Armordillos nearby.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"We were just about to take on these Sandy Armordillos so we can get by. Wanna join us?" #npc$$821$1#|
13962|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"We didn't know Jonah was such a coward until we fought those bandits. As you see, he's now a nervous wreck. What a chicken!"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah points to the other mercenary beside her and laughs.##npc$$821$1#|
13963|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having handled the Sandy Armordillos, you return to Phaelah to give her the news of the cleared path.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Alright! With those monsters cleared, we can go seek out our lost mercenaries. I...have no idea where they are."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah giggles nervously.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Shocked by this turn of events, you had no idea that some of the mercenary troop was missing! You ask Phaelah if she knows where her companions could be. Is it possible that they've been trapped by the Sand Owl Bandits?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Of course there are more of us! We intended to cross the Cracked Sand Plain so we could surprise the Sand Owl Group, but our plan was found out and they started tracking us. We thought it would be a good idea to split up, maybe confuse them. But, uh, we didn't really organize our routes..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"I may as well be all alone out here though! These other mercenaries, after only a single fight, have become so scared and timid! Look at this one, he calls himself Jonah - I call him a wimp! He's shaking like a leaf!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$When you look to the other mercenaries, all of whom are trembling with fear, you see that many of them are wounded, although not fatally...##char$$828:80$0#|
13964|Phaelah's path to the Sand Owl Camp was blocked by Sandy Armordillos. She would like to be on her way and has invited you to join her in fighting them off.|
13971|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"I have been thinking... Perhaps we should go back to the Oasis and come up with a better plan. Once we're ready, then we can come back out and search for our missing mercenaries."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah looks to you. You can tell she hopes you'll agree so they can return to safety as soon as possible.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Looking around, you can tell that most of the mercenaries look ready to give up and run home. However, for the moment, you keep your opinion to yourself and instead ask Phaelah what she knows about the Sand Owl Bandits.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"The Sand Owl Bandits recruit members from both the Avians and the Humans, but they've never been very well trained - until now. Lately their skills have greatly improved - they must be stepping up their training regimen!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"If you expect us mercenaries to take on the entire new and improved Sand Owl Camp - no small feat, if I might add - then we'll definitely need to mount a ranged attack! We'll need a huge amount of arrows so that we can keep them all at bay! Right, everyone?"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah says this with great confidence.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"But...we are completely out of arrows after our last, er, battle..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"How did you run out of arrows? I thought you only encountered one Sand Owl! Did you really shoot your entire supply of arrows at one foe?"#br##br#
#&53$%p%, confused, wonders how so many arrows could be used to fend off one enemy...##pet$$822$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Sure, there was only one Sand Owl patrolman... But many Armordillos! With their hard hides, we hardly damaged them, though. I wasted many arrows trying to find a weak point, but in the end it was completely useless."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"So I'm thinking we should be able to retrieve the arrows I shot, either from their backs or the ones scattered in the bushes. Problem solved!"#npc$$821$1#|
13972|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"A good commander can predict what's gonna happen and always keep a step ahead!"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah seems quite proud of herself.##npc$$821$1#|
13973|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Look at them all! So many arrows!"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah holds up the mostly broken and useless arrows proudly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After the tale of wasting arrows on heavily armored Armordillos and now trying to use those damaged arrows to attack the bandits' camp, you now fully understand why Ben called these mercenaries "useless".##char$$821$0#|
13974|Phaelah thinks they need more arrows to attack the bandits' camp, so she asks you to help her retrieve the Arrows stuck in the Armordillos' back and scattered in the bush.|
13981|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Everybody, prepare yourselves! It's time to take out those bandits!"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah shouts orders to the other mercenaries.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"We will advance from our current position and pass through Rex territory, then cross through the Curly-Tailed Chameleon's realm in the north. This will bring us to a position of advantage upon the bandits' camp!"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah indicates positions on the map as she gives her orders.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"We need to send a scout to make sure the way is clear before proceeding."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah looks around, observing the other mercenaries' reactions. Nobody speaks up.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Looks like it's up to you then, %n%! Scout out our attack route, maybe you will even find other missing mercenaries along the way."#npc$$821$1#|
13982|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Hm...who does this nice kettle belong to...?"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah looks around shiftily and shoves it into her pack.##br##br#
"Guess it's mine! Heh heh..." #br##br#
#&53$Phaelah and the other mercenaries are slowly packing up "their" supplies.##npc$$821$1#|
13983|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Welcome back. Did you find any of the missing mercenaries along the way? What about the headquarters' guards?...Did you find anyone out there!?"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah looks worried.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You slowly shake your head; you found no one along the route that you scouted.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Nobody there...could it be too dangerous perhaps? Maybe we need to reconsider our plan of attack..."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah paces back and forth, chewing on her fingernails nervously.##npc$$821$1#|
13984|Phaelah asks you to scout out the route she has planned while the rest of the mercenaries pack up supplies. They seem to want you to do their work all on your own...|
13991|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Hmm... after thinking about it carefully, I have reached the best possible conclusion. A decision fit for the best of the mercenaries out here: me! Ahem. We will retreat at once to the camp at Palmgil Oasis!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After her grand plan of attack, you're shocked at Phaelah's decision. You almost don't want to bother, but you ask her why she's changed her mind.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"As you know, poor Jonah is so scared that he refuses to walk. Obviously, he knows this is a trap! I see that the path ahead is crawling with dinosaurs... Jonah might be right to be afraid, don't you think?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You stare at Phaelah for a few seconds, then shrug and tell her you'll take care of the dino problem. It should be safe, then, for them to press on...you hope.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Yes, good work, what would you do without my great decision making! Get out there at once! If, uh, something goes wrong though, we'll totally just retreat- er, rescue you!"#npc$$821$1#|
13992|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"I didn't realize how tough the Sand Owl Bandits really are...I can't believe there are so few of us left out here."#npc$$821$1#|
13993|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having handled the Rex infestation, you return to tell Phaelah but find her pacing back and forth in a panic.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Thanks for your help, but we have a critical situation here..."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah turns and looks at Jonah with concern.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You turn and see Jonah laying on the ground, shivering. He has become paralyzed with fear and seems to be unconscious! His lips are so pale... Could this be the effects of the Sand Owl Bandits' poison?##char$$823$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$There is no time to spare! You quickly tell Phaelah that you think Jonah and many of the other mercenaries could likely be poisoned. You ask Phaelah to examine them at once.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"What? Poisoned?! I'm on it!"#npc$$823$1#|
13994|Since Jonah is in shock and the road ahead is fraught with danger, you offered to defeat any Rex along the route so that Phaelah and her team will feel safe and not retreat.|
14001|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"What have we here... It looks just like a regular blade wound. There is some swelling, but... Could it really be poison?!"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah can hardly believe it.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"When Jonah said he lost his strength and started shivering, I thought it was simply because he was a coward..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After listening to Phaelah's description of Jonah's reaction, you remembered that Camilla told you all about the Curly-Tailed Chameleon's venom back at camp. You tell Phaelah all you know about the poison and its antidote.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Aah! It's really that complicated?! I only have a basic antidote, and that won't work on this particular poison... If we don't get the right venom to make our own antidote, Jonah will..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You put your hand on her shoulder and tell Phaelah to watch over Jonah. You will head out and collect the Curly-Tailed Chameleon's venom for the antidote.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Okay, then. It's all in your hands. I heard that the Curly-Tailed Chameleons like to hang around the entrance of the Sand Owl Camp. Please, be quick!"#npc$$828$1#|
14002|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Jonah...hold on, man! I'm sorry I ever called you coward..."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah watches over Jonah worriedly.##npc$$821$1#|
14003|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand all the Poison Glands you were able to gather over to Phaelah, hopeful that she knows what to do next.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Is this it? The Curly-Tailed Chameleon's venom?"#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah looks tense.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Ok, I'll get started... I studied alchemy long ago, before I became a mercenary. I gotta make it up to Jonah. The way I treated him..."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah gets to work right away.##npc$$821$1#|
14004|Jonah is suffering the effects of the Curly-Tailed Chameleon's venom. Phaelah knows a bit about poisons and antidotes, but is watching over Jonah, so you must collect a sample of their Poison Glands to help Phaelah make an antidote.

Go to the outskirts of the Sand Owl Camp and get the Curly-Tailed Chameleon's Poison Glands to give to Phaelah.|
14011|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"This should be just the right amount. If I'm not careful and put in too much venom, this antidote will just make Jonah worse." #br##br#
#&53$Phaelah mixes the venom and basic antidote carefully.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Fighting poison with poison is the only way sometimes. We have no other choice out in the field; this better work..."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah tries to give Jonah her antidote, but is trembling like a leaf.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Here, I'm too nervous to administer the antidote. Get him to drink it as soon as possible! Hopefully it will ease his pain quickly."#br##br#
#&53$Phaelah, exhausted, wipes the sweat from her brow.##npc$$821$1#|
14012|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Jonah... You'll be back on your feet soon. Don't give up hope yet."#npc$$821$1#|
14013|#&7$Jonah##br#
#&53$Not long after receiving the antidote, Jonah begins to awaken.##M122050h+55$Jonah$501$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
#&53$Phaelah finishes mixing the other antidotes and administers them to the other mercenaries. Suddenly you see Jonah staggering over.##M124040$Phaelah$101$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"Jonah! Do you feel any better?"#M124040$Phaelah$823$1#

#&7$Jonah##br#
"Phaelah... you idiot...You can't even distinguish between fear and poison...If my mouth wasn't so numb... I'd really give you an earful!"#M122050$Jonah$501$0#

#&7$Jonah##br#
"Is everyone else okay? You almost killed us..."#M122050$Jonah$501$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"I'm so sorry, Jonah. At least I caught it in time, right? I hope you can forgive me, I was such a fool..." #br##br#
#&53$Phaelah smiles sheepishly.##M124040$Phaelah$821$1#|
14014|Before Jonah succumbs to the poison, administer the finished antidote to him.|
14021|#&7$Phaelah##br#
"How are you feeling, Jonah? Are you well enough to travel?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jonah##br#
"I'm awake, aren't I?! I was poisoned, not killed! Geez..."#M122050h+55$Jonah$501$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"%n%, even though the time is ripe for our attack on the Sand Owl Camp, we must bring Jonah back to Palmgil Oasis for medical treatment as soon as possible."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"I've been doing some thinking while Jonah was recovering. The other mercenaries, along with the guards, were probably captured by the Sand Owl Bandits. If we are to rescue them, we'll have to sneak into their camp."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jonah##br#
"Hurry...enough talking... I, uh, suddenly don't feel too well...The antidote you made... You're sure it was an...antidote, right?"#M122050$Jonah$501$0#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
#&53$Phaelah looks at you and shrugs.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Phaelah##br#
"We have to take care of our own first, so we'll be bringing Jonah back to Palmgil Oasis right away. Upon our arrival, we'll ask Ben to send reinforcements to assist you. While waiting for them to arrive, why not investigate Sand Owl Camp first and establish a good strategy?"#npc$$821$1#|
14022|#&7$Clive##br#
"Hmph, you can't make me talk! You might as well just kill me, I'll never reveal the Palmgil Oasis secret!"#br##br#
#&53$Clive glowers at you.##npc$$821$1#|
14023|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you approach the trapped mercenaries, you are quite taken aback by their looks of extreme disgust.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Clive##br#
"You scum only captured us because we let our guard down for a second! We have nothing to say to you. Don't even think of asking us to reveal our leaders or plans or anything! We'll never talk. Never, I say!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You introduce yourself to Clive and tell him that you are not a bandit.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Clive##br#
"That a fact? I've heard of you. The rookie, %n%? Did Ben send you here? Thank goodness! Get us out of here!"#npc$$821$1#|
14024|Jonah is still in danger, so Phaelah decides to help him back to Palmgil Oasis for further treatment. You stay behind and agree to investigate the Sand Owl Camp in case you can stealthily rescue the mercenaries and guards before reinforcements arrive.|
14031|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You try to open Clive's cage through brute force, but it is exceptionally strong with a well-made lock. You ask him if he knows where you can find the key.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Clive##br#
"These bandits aren't very well organized, even with their new leader. Many of the Sand Owl Bandits are in possession of a Cage Key."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clive##br#
"You should be able to snatch a key from one of the bandits nearby. Try to ambush one and get back here without drawing too much attention."#npc$$825$1#|
14032|#&7$Clive##br#
"Guys, be quiet, Ben sent someone to rescue us."#br##br#
#&53$Clive whispers to the other imprisoned mercenaries to discuss their imminent.##npc$$821$1#|
14033|#&7$Clive##br#
"Alright, we're almost all free from these cages. We should begin planning how to sneak out of the camp. Unless someone has a better idea, I think we-"#M111040$Clive$821$1#

#&7$Mercenary ##br#
"Hold on! You're just going to run away? What about revenge? The Thief Captain's tent is right over there!"#M003010$Mercenary $821$0#

#&7$Clive##br#
"Are you kidding me? I know he needs to be stopped, but there's no way any of us can stand up to him. We have to get out of here while we have the chance! Once we regroup we can figure out how to deal with the Thief Captain."#M111040$Clive$826$1#

#&7$Clive##br#
#&53$Clive stops to think for a moment.##br##br#
"It doesn't matter. Whether we fight or run, we're sitting ducks without our gear. %n%, you're the only one of us who can move around the camp. Can you help us to reequip?"#M111040$Clive$828$1#|
14034|The Sand Owl Bandits carry the Cage Keys you need to free Clive and the other mercenaries. You need to snatch one of these keys to release each prisoner.|
14041|#&7$Clive##br#
"%n%, I need to ask you for one last favor..." #br##br#
#&53$Clive looks around and continues talking softly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clive##br#
"When we were imprisoned, a Sand Owl Hunter stripped us of our weapons and armor. Would you do us this great favor and steal them back for us?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clive##br#
"Once we're fully equipped, we'll be able to escape by ourselves."#npc$$821$1#|
14042|#&7$Clive##br#
"Alright, guys, let's get to work!" #npc$$821$1#|
14043|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the equipment you managed to recover over to Clive. The mercenaries begin to gear up quickly, still trying to give the illusion that they are locked in their cages.##char$$822:0$0# 

#&7$Clive##br#
"I'd rather have my own gear, but at this point, I can't be too choosy."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Clive##br#
"Suit up, people! It won't be long before those bandits figure out we gave 'em the slip."#npc$$821$1#|
14044|The Sand Owl Hunters confiscated the guards' and mercenaries' gear. Clive plotted to get at least the weapons back, so they could orchestrate their own escape.|
14051|#&7$Clive##br#
"Listen up, %n%, here's the plan. I'll lead the fall-back to Palmgil Oasis, but there's still someone who could use your help..."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Clive##br#
"There's a guy named Freddie who's with us, part of the Alliance Guard. He managed to escape on his own and tried to take out the bandits' leader, but we don't know what happened after that."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Clive##br#
"He's the one who led us to the Sand Owl Camp in order to locate an item of importance for the Sanknie Alliance."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Clive##br#
"When the First Expedition Team was captured by the Sand Owls, that important item was stolen. Freddie didn't dare report the missing item to Hayes until it was safely within the Alliance's grasp once more."#npc$$827$1# 

#&7$%p%##br#
"What's so important to the Alliance?"#br##br#
#&53$%p%, always curious, suddenly jogs your memory about something Camilla mentioned back in the Oasis. Something about a "Star Plan."##pet$$821$0# 

#&7$Clive##br#
"Pah, does it matter? We're mercenaries! As long as we're paid, we'll help whoever. As for this secret item, us mercenaries have a need-to-know policy. In this case, we really didn't need to know, apparently."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Clive##br#
"Anyway, I suspect he's still alive, hiding somewhere in the Sand Owl Camp. If you go in there and stir up a commotion, he'll see his chance and rendezvous with you to escape. Watch out for the patrolling Sand Owl Knifemasters and I think you'll be fine. I'm getting really worried about Freddie, so you better move quickly."#npc$$821$1#|
14052|#&7$Freddie##br#
"Tsch...found out at last, huh? Alright then, let's rumble!"#br##br#
#&53$Freddie flashes you a fierce gaze.##npc$$826$1#|
14053|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$At last, you've found Freddie! You call out to him only to be met with a steely gaze.##char$$801:0$0# 

#&7$Freddie##br#
#&53$Freddie looks you over and immediately goes on the defensive, ready to strike at any moment.##npc$$1001$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You quickly explain who you are and why you've come.##char$$823:0$0# 

#&7$Freddie##br#
"So, you mean to tell me you're the one who smacked down all those bandits on the ground? It's... hard to believe. What mercenary band are you with?"#br##br#
#&53$Freddie continues talking with you, ever looking more surprised.##npc$$823$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell him that Clive and the others escaped to Palmgil Oasis and are hoping to rendezvous with him there.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Freddie##br#
"You go on if you want. I've still got something I need to do."#br##br#
#&53$Freddie says in a firm voice.##npc$$821$1#|
14054|Clive and the others are escaping to Palmgil Oasis, and he's trusting you to find Freddie and tell him to fall back. Freddie is in hiding, though, so unless you make a commotion, he won't see his chance to escape. With a patrol of Sand Owl Knifemasters going around, he fears what would happen if they were to find Freddie first.

Defeat the Sand Owl Knifemasters around the Sand Owl Camp while looking for Alliance Guard Freddie.|
14061|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take a moment to grab Freddie's attention and ask him about the reason for searching the Sand Owl Camp.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Freddie##br#
"Buh? Didn't Ben tell you anything about the Star Plan?"#br##br#
#&53$Freddie looks a bit confused.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Freddie##br#
"Oh well.  No time like the present, eh? As I'm putting my life in your hands, how could it hurt to tell you? The Star Plan is the reason there's even a division here in the first place. The goal was to unearth the treasure hidden beneath the desert."#br##br#
#&53$Freddie nods and points at the ground.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Freddie##br#
"That's right, treasure - just like you've probably heard. But our only copy of the map got nicked by the Sand Owls. I'll bet it's already made its way into their leader's hands."#npc$$821$1##&PP01101#

#&7$Freddie##br#
"The new Sand Owl Leader has only had the position for a short time. It is said that he is a formidable fighter, and that he defeated all of the officers in the group. That's how he rose so quickly..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Freddie you're willing to help steal the treasure map back, if he'd like a hand.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Freddie##br#
"Sounds keen, mate. But let's move separately. You're the better fighter - why don't you face down the leader? I'll stir up some trouble in the camp, to get the rest of the bandits' attention. How's that that for a plan?"#npc$$821$1#|
14062|#&7$Helakar##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
14063|#&7$Helakar##br#
#&53$Even though you rush at him, weapon drawn, Helakar calmly stands before you while looking you up and down.##npc$$821$1#|
14064|After some poking and prying, you get Freddie to reveal the true goal of the Star Plan. However, the map showing the locations of the ruins beneath the sands has fallen into the hands of the bandits. With time running out, you team up with Freddie, enacting a plan to distract the bandits while you challenge their formidable leader.|
14071|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You demand that Helakar reveal to you the location of the map, but are only met with a blank stare.##char$$827:79$0# 

#&7$Helakar##br#
"Hmph... I didn't expect we'd meet again, %n%, especially like this."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$He knows your name? You can't help but stare in shock - you've never met this person before!##char$$823:0$0# 

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, be careful! That's-"#pet$$1001$0# 

#&7$Helakar##br#
#&53$Before %p% can finish the sentence, Helakar, leader of the Sand Owl Bandits, suddenly rushes you with his weapons drawn!##npc$$1001$1#

#&53$Once you accept this quest, Helakar won't hesitate to attack, so be ready!#|
14072|#&7$Helakar##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
14073|#&7$???##br#
"Once may be luck, but twice is no mere chance..."#br##br#
#&53$Just as you are about to defeat Helakar, a woman's voice is carried in on the wind.##M621010$Helakar$1$1# 

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Even Helakar... No, perhaps I should say: my new Eidolon has also lost to you? How...boring!"#br##br#
#&53$A familiar form boldly walks up to you.##M124030$Caroline$3001$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Caroline?! It can't be! The one who turned Cactakara Forest practically upside down with her rage... You never thought you'd see your nemesis out here!##char$$823$0# 

#&7$Caroline##br#
"Hmph. I had hoped that after Cactakara Forest, you'd have learned that it doesn't pay to stick your nose into others' business."#br##br#
#&53$Caroline laughs condescendingly.##M124030$Caroline$821$1#|
14074|You finally faced off against Helakar, the fearsome leader of the Sand Owl Bandits. As you expected, he wasted no time attacking you.|
14081|#&7$Caroline##br#
"It seems we've both matured. I hate to admit it, but you may have the edge as far as mastering this power is concerned."#br##br#
#&53$Caroline narrows her eyes.##br##br#
"I don't have the time to waste on you, %n%; I've got more important matters to deal with." #M124030$Caroline$821$1# 

#&7$Caroline##br#
"You're here for the treasure map, right? Go on, get this musty old thing out of my sight. Consider it a boon from your better." #M124030$Caroline$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Before you can react, Caroline and Helakar disappear in a flash of light, leaving behind only Helakar's fading afterimage. Breathless, Freddie dashes to your side.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Freddie##br#
"Wow, sent 'em packin', you did! You got the map, right? I'll bet Hayes will be happy to have that back. How about you take it back to the Palmgil Oasis while I round up some of the other mercs to truck some supplies back there?"#M125020$Freddie$821$1#|
14082|#&7$Hayes##br#
"What a useless bunch!" #br# #&53$Hayes fumes and kicks at a little pile of sand.# #npc$$821$1#|
14083|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the treasure map to Hayes.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Gadzooks! The stolen map! How in blazes did you get your hands on that?"#br##br#
#&53$Hayes looks you over in both wonder and confusion.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Wait...you're that mercenary who recently joined up with us, aren't you? The one people have been talking about... %n%, right? I've heard quite the account of your accomplishments!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Hayes the tale of your dangerous skirmish with the Sand Owl Bandits, and how you faced down Caroline and Helakar.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Well, you certainly have a knack for this sort of thing. Might you be interested in joining us in a more... full-time capacity? When the Star Plan bears fruit, you'll have more money than you can spend!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Ah, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me explain the particulars of the Star Plan. If it catches your interest, I've got the paperwork to sign you on as a partner, right here."#npc$$821$1#|
14084|You hadn't expected Caroline, whom you encountered in Cactakara Forest, to be behind the Sand Owl Bandits' raids. Fortunately, you foiled her scheme, chased her off, and reclaimed the treasure map. Better get it back to Hayes - he's probably worrying himself into a sweat.|
14091|#&7$Hayes##br#
"If you know this region's legends, you may have heard of a massive complex of ruins, long ago vanished beneath the desert sands. These are the fabled Ozymand Temple, seat of the old kingdom! The wealth in those ruins could make the hoards of today's rulers look like paupers' pennies!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"And THIS, right here, is the only known map showing its location!"#br##br#
#&53$Hayes spreads the map proudly before you.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Hayes##br#
"According to the map, Ozymand Temple is actually on the other side of the desert. The problem is, it's just not possible to walk straight through, even with plentiful supplies." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Only Akara knows the shifting paths of the desert, but no matter how we tried to petition and persuade him, he just wouldn't agree to guide us. If you're willing to join up with us, do you think you could maybe convince Akara for me? You've got a trustworthy look about you - perhaps you'll succeed where we failed." #npc$$821$1#|
14092|#&7$Akara##br#
#&53$Akara looks you over with a flinty gaze.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14093|#&7$Akara##br#
#&53$Akara frowns, apparently lost in thought. You wait, patiently, before deciding to speak up.##npcs85h+70$$1$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After a friendly introduction, you begin to explain Hayes's request to the peculiar looking Dwarf.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
#&53$Akara frowns dismissively as he holds up his hand to interrupt you.##br##br#
"Did Hayes put you up to this? You're wasting your time."#npc$$828$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
#&53$With his hand still suspended in the air, he looks over your shoulder, suddenly seeming a bit unnerved, but quickly returns to his calm demeanor.##npc$$1$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"What did you say your name was... %n%, is that it? This name... It means something to me. Come here. Closer, closer! Let me take a good look at you..."#npc$$821$1#|
14094|Hayes told you the truth behind the Star Plan, hoping you'll be able to convince the desert guide, Akara, to join the expedition.|
14095|#&7$Tina##br#
"You're %n%, right? The one Hayes invited to be a part of the Star Plan?"#br##br#
#&53$Not waiting for a response, Tina continues to talk.##npc$$822$1# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"Wow, a personal invitation from Hayes! That's quite the honor. To be in charge of such a large division of the Sanknie Alliance requires not only ability, but also an elaborate network of people and great diplomatic skill!"#npc$$825$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You mention Akara to Tina, inquiring as to the current situation and any tips to convince him to help.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"That... person is frustratingly mysterious. He's standoffish to merchants like us, like we're not worth his time!"#br##br#
#&53$Tina looks at Akara and sticks her tongue out, then draws it back in, self-consciously.##npc$$827$1# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"Anyway, as for Akara... Back when our caravan got lost in the desert, Akara was the one who found us, and led us back to the oasis. Without him, who knows what would've happened?"#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"But when Hayes invited Akara to guide the caravan through the desert to Ozymand Temple, Akara turned him down flat, left the oasis, and came here alone. If you're trying to get him to join up, you're probably wasting your time. I was sent here to persuade him, but can't get him to budge an inch on his decision. I can't imagine him agreeing to it."#npc$$821$1#|
14101|#&7$Akara##br#
"Interesting... You and that girl are much alike."#br##br#
#&53$Akara pauses, studying you with his gaze, then looks at %p% for what feels like a long time.##npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"You seem to have experienced much, for one so young. Perhaps you might be willing to do me a favor. Then, we can sit down and have a talk about the request that brought you here."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"There is something I need to do, but first, I must concoct a certain potion. Without that potion, I can't do what I need to." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Many Paralyzing Spiderlings inhabit the area around the tower, and I'd like you to bring me some of their glands, as well as some Venom Bug Eggs." #npc$$821$1#|
14102|#&7$Akara##br#
"How are you faring? I'll be waiting here for you to bring those glands and eggs."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14103|#&7$Akara##br#
"Ah, back so soon? How did your task go?"#br##br#
#&53$Akara stares at you creepily as he waits for your answer.##npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Paralyzing Spiders' glands and Venom Bug Eggs over.##char$$822:0$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"You rather seem a trustworthy sort, especially for someone affiliated with Hayes's caravan. I just may have a use for you, as you do for me."#br##br#
#&53$Akara takes the glands and eggs from you.##npc$$828$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"As you were gathering those, I thought things over, and decided that if you're along, I will guide the caravan through the desert to the Ozymand Temple."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Tina##br#
#&53$Before Akara finishes his statement, Tina's jaw drops in shock at his sudden acquiescence.##M106010$Tina$823$0# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You also get a strange feeling about Akara's agreement. You are about to express your unease, when Akara begins to speak again.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"I have one condition, though... I will only help you if you agree to help me, %n%."#br##br#
#&53$As Akara speaks, he mashes the eggs and spiderling glands into a paste.##npc$$821$1#|
14104|Before you could properly ask Akara to join the caravan, he asked you to bring him some Paralyzing Spiders' glands and Venom Bug Eggs, from which he could make a potion.|
14111|#&7$Akara##br#
"Shall we make a deal? A bargain, if you will? If you help me in what I need, I will gladly escort the Sanknie Alliance across the dunes. Oh, don't look at me like that, I won't ask you to do anything morally corrupt or life-threatening! And of course, if I violate the agreement, you won't have to help me at all."#npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You aren't entirely sure of what Akara plans, but if he really can safely lead the expedition team, it might be worth considering. His eagerness to help seems very strange, though.##char$$828:0$0# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After thinking on it, you nod your head in agreement and ask Akara what kind of assistance he will need.##char$$821:0$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Well then, since we've come to an agreement, let's commence the preparations." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
#&53$Akara grins.##br##br#

"First things first, we have some simple issues to handle that, in my opinion, should already have been dealt with. If you head due east, you'll see quite a number of Sandy Armordillos. The expedition's path will have to cross over their habitat."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"If you want the expedition to have a safe journey, you'll need to temporarily clear the Armordillos out of here."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"Is there... Is there any way at all to avoid all those Armordillos? They look quite formidable."#br##br#
#&53$Worried, Tina's voice is barely a whisper.##M106010$Tina$828$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"I've given you my advice - what you do next is up to you. To answer your question, this route is one of the desert's LEAST dangerous paths."#br##br#
#&53$Akara turns back to mixing his potion.##npc$$821$1#|
14112|#&7$Akara##br#
"What are you still standing around for? Do you think I'd spin some grand fabrication, just to send you on a fool's errand?" #npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"As you can see, I still have preparations of my own to take care of." #br##br#
#&53$Akara points down at his blended mash of anesthetic.##npc$$821$1#|
14113|#&7$Akara##br#
"Not bad, for a newcomer to the desert. But compared to what lies ahead, those Armordillos are just a warm-up."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14114|Akara showed you a safe route, but even this clearer path was a habitat for Sandy Armordillos. He wants you to clear them out of the area to ensure the safety of the expedition as it passes through.|
14121|#&7$Akara##br#
"I've been down to Palmgil Oasis to check out the caravan, so I know their setup, more or less. To cross the desert, one must have enough food - and especially, enough water. Then there's all the equipment the expedition has to haul as well." #npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$Akara##br#
"With the caravan's limited number of pack animals, it's virtually impossible for them to both carry all the supplies they need and take all of their equipment."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Here's our plan, then. To the east, you'll find more Sandy Armordillos. Take these reins, and harness the strongest of them. I'll give Tina some instruction in how to tame the beasts. You see where I'm going with this?" #npc$$821$1#|
14122|#&7$Tina##br#
"Akara wanted me to learn how to domesticate Armordillos, but I'm not so sure I'm comfortable around animals that could maul me the second my back is turned..." #npc$$821$1#|
14123|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the reigns of the Armordillo over to Tina. She hesitates, briefly, before taking control of the beast.##char$$822:0$0# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"Hey, %n%... do you really trust Akara? Don't you think it's strange how he agreed to help the expedition after he'd turned us down so many times? It gives me an uneasy feeling that just won't go away."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell her that you question Akara's true purpose as well, and are wondering what exactly he could want from you. Curious, you ask Tina if she knows the reason behind Akara's appearance in the Star Sand Desert.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"Hayes did send someone to investigate him, but they didn't come up with anything at all. The only thing we know is that he always stays in his tower. Nobody has a clue how he got here while an entire Expedition Team was lost..."#npc$$828$1# 

#&7$Armordillo##br#
#&53$Suddenly the Armordillo becomes spooked and pulls hard against the reins!##M087050s80h+85$Armordillo$2012$0# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"Shhh! Relax! It's ok!"#br##br#
#&53$Tina tightens her grip on the reigns as Akara instructed and pulls the beast close, giving it a tap on the nose. Amazingly, it slowly settles down.##npc$$827$1# 

#&7$Tina##br#
"Ah, whatever. I can doubt, but it's not like I have any proof. If not for Akara, I'll cooperate for your sake. You're one of us, after all. If you need anything, just let us know!"#npc$$821$1#|
14124|Akara shared his observation that it's impossible for the expedition to cross the desert without more pack animals to haul supplies and equipment. He gave you taming reins and sent you east to catch a strong Sandy Armordillo for Tina to tame.|
14131|#&7$Akara##br#
"Already finished with the caravan preparations, are you? Good, good; now you can help me with my own personal preparations." #npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"First, I need you to find something in the tower to the north." #br##br#
#&53$You get the feeling that Akara is being purposefully vague.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"On your way there, you may happen upon the Giant Mountain Dragon. If you do, put everything you have into besting it so you can venture deeper in, to right about here."#br##br# #&53$Akara pulls out a map and points to a marked set of coordinates.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Use whatever mining tools you need and dig there, but dig carefully. Then bring what you've unearthed back to me." #npc$$821$1#|
14132|#&7$Akara##br#
"Still here, eh? What's the matter, cold feet? Or do you just like hanging around with me that much? Don't forget, I've helped you quite a bit already - all I'm asking now is for you to dig up what's buried at that site." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14133|#&7$Akara##br#
"Ah, you're back! Have you found anything of interest?"#br##br#
#&53$Normally calm, a glimmer of worry flashes upon his face.##npcs85h+70$$827$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Akara that after a while of careful digging, the only thing you were able to discover was a very old, fossilized egg.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Ah, yes. This is exactly what I was wanting."#br##br#
#&53$Akara cradles the Dragon Egg to his chest, checking it carefully. He puts his ear to the shell, as though straining to hear even the faintest sound.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Excellent. Just as I'd hoped. This is no ordinary dragon egg, %n%. Long ago it was sealed away..."#br##br#
#&53$Akara trails off for a moment as he inspects the egg. Looking up, he pauses.##npc$$821$1#|
14134|The expedition has almost completed its preparations. Now, Akara has given you one more odd task: Defeat the Giant Mountain Dragon roaming around your destination, and dig up something at the place he showed you on the map.|
14141|#&7$Akara##br#
"For many years, I have been studying the history of the dragons that once roamed our lands. According to legend, an ancient dragon was sealed away in these very dunes."#npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"This is no normal dragon egg - it is a dragon egg that was sealed by a demon in ancient times. Interesting, yes, but that's not the point..."#br##br#
#&53$Akara frowns.##npc$$1$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"I don't know why they sealed it - I'm sure they had their reasons - but the takeaway is that only one recognized as an Envoy of Gaia can remove the demonic seal and return this egg to the flow of time."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Only Envoys of Gaia! No wonder Akara changed his attitude after seeing you and %p%. He only wanted to use you to unseal the egg!##char$$828:0$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Look, look here! Can you see life returning to it? Now, let us see if we can hatch the dragon within."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You watch anxiously as Akara inspects the dragon egg for signs of life. Though nothing seems to be happening on the surface, you feel a strong power emanating from within the thick shell.##char$$823:0$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Your work here is not yet finished, %n%. We have an agreement that you will aid me. I will need you now to help hatch this most ancient of dragons."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Hesitating for a moment, you manage to work up the courage to ask Akara if this dragon would not be a terrible danger to the world.##char$$821:0$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Certainly not, %n%. The legend says that this particular dragon is sacred - even friendly. It is of a species once believed to be guardians of our realm, watching over the safety of all. Perhaps that is the reason this egg was sealed here by a mysterious evil force. At long last it is time... time for the dragon to be free once more!"#npc$$1$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"I've already made it clear to Merle that hatching this egg is important. Take this anesthetic to him out on Cactus Plateau. While you're doing that, I'll head back to Palmgil Oasis to help your friends."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"While you head to the Plateau, I will uphold my end of the bargain. I will return to Palmgil Oasis and aid your companions in their travel through the dunes. Let us make haste to carry out our tasks, %n%."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you prepare to leave the tower, a feeling of worry looms over you like a dark cloud. You somehow feel like you already know how to hatch the dragon, yet...you're simply not sure if it is a wise decision.##clean$$1# 

#&7$%p%##br#
"Worried about hatching the dragon, aren't you?"#br##br#
#&53$%p% seems to be able to read your every thought these days.##pet$$821$1# 

#&7$%p%##br#
"Don't worry, %n%! Can't you feel the pure sacred energy coming from this egg? I think it'll be no trouble at all!"#pet$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Nodding your head, you know that %p% is right - the egg does feel special...sacred, even. You decide to commit yourself to hatching it for Akara.##char$$806:0$0#|
14142|#&7$Merle##br#
"What the heck? How do you expect me to hatch an egg out here in the boondocks? You're not expecting me to sit on it, are you?" #npc$$821$1#|
14143|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You greet Merle and tell him what's going on with Akara and the strange ancient dragon egg.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Confound it! That crazy Akara wants to hatch a dragon?! Inconceivable! I heard about crazy people like him - completely mad about dragons! He's one of them, isn't he!"#npc$$828$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Let's get this over with, then! It's...a bit unsettling around here, to be honest. And then Akara saddled me with this kid..."#br##br#
#&53$Merle gestures to the young Haas beside him.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Akara told me I'd be paid well if I worked with the caravan. That's why I'm here - I'm helping!"#br##br#
#&53$Haas smiles happily.##M001040$Haas$821$0#|
14144|Akara plans to hatch the unsealed dragon egg, but preparing to do so was proving a complicated process. That's why he requested Merle from the Alliance to wait for you on Cactus Plateau with his cart.|
14151|#&7$Merle##br#
"Guh... What is all this stuff for? Next time he'll probably ask me to do his laundry, too." #br##br#
#&53$Merle reads impatiently over Akara's list.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"So...%n%, two types of spiderling mucus are needed to hatch the egg. We're to put it in a crystal bottle." #br##br#
#&53$Merle rummages around in his cart and pulls out a crystal bottle.##br##br# 
"The instructions say we need to mix the two substances to get the reaction we want." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"You can find the Spiderlings out here on Cactus Plateau. When you've mixed the ingredients, just put the bottle back in the cart. I don't want to touch that nasty stuff."#npc$$821$1#|
14152|#&7$Cart##br#
#&53$The cart seems to be chock-full of items Akara has prepared for hatching the dragon egg.##npc$$821$1#|
14153|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You carefully place the crystal bottle back in the cart. Merle stands beside you, looking on curiously.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"What the heck does Akara want with this nasty stuff?"#br##br#
#&53$Merle looks curiously at the crystal bottle.##M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Is...is that smoke? Whoa, it's heating up!" #M101020$Merle$823$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"I wasn't expecting that. I guess mixing those two types of mucus generates heat. Where did this guy study chemistry, anyway?" #M101020$Merle$821$1#|
14154|Following Akara's request, you collected two different types of Spiderling mucus on Cactus Plateau, then mixed them in the crystal bottle.|
14161|#&7$Merle##br#
"Hey, %n%, have you noticed those Spiderlings are getting closer? It's kind of unnerving."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
#&53$Merle pulls out the list and examines it again.##br##br#
"Now that I look at it again, Akara's list said this would happen. That guy's a real piece of work..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"He knew the Spiderlings were aggressive and the list says he already prepared a fumigation agent for us in advance!"#br##br#
#&53$Merle rummages around in the cart and pulls out a pesticide.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"Okay %n%, spread some of this pesticide right about there,and don't forget to bring back the empty jars - we can always refill those." #npc$$821$1#|
14162|#&7$Merle##br#
"How's the pesticide working against those bugs? You brought back the empty jars, right? Let me slap some more pesticide in those. I don't like poison, but I like bugs even less."#npc$$821$1#|
14163|#&7$Merle##br#
"Well, at least the pesticide seems to be effective."#br##br#
#&53$Merle surveys the dead Spiderlings around him.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Might as well refill those jars, just to be on the safe side. No telling when we might need to bust 'em out again." #npc$$821$1#|
14164|Merle became wary of the aggressive Spiderlings as he noticed them drawing closer. Fortunately, Akara had prepared a pesticide in advance that would drive them away for the time being.|
14171|#&7$Merle##br#
"Hey... Hey kid. Hey, are you listening to me? It's your turn to pick Dragon Bell Grass."#M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"My name's not 'kid', it's Haas. Why should I listen to someone who can't even bother calling me my name? What about all those Sandstorm Rexes around the place where the grass is? If they're still around, there's no way I'm going there!"#M001030$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Why you little..."#M101020$Merle$826$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
#&53$Merle clenches his fists and turns to you.##br##br#
"Oooo-kay. %n%, would you so kindly clear out those Sandstorm Rexes so Lord Weenie the Sixth here can go do his job?" #M101020$Merle$826$1#|
14172|#&7$Merle##br#
"Stupid kid, stop running your mouth."#br##br#
#&53$Merle barks at Haas.##M101020$Merle$826$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"You're the one who's overreacting, not me!"#br##br#
#&53$Haas says defensively.##M001030$Haas$821$0#|
14173|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Returning from the dunes, you tell Merle that you've completely taken care of the Rex problem.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"All clear? Excellent. Now, let's see what kind of skills this kid's got."#npc$$821$1#|
14174|The place where the Dragon Bell Grass grows is frequented by dangerous Sandstorm Rexes, and the local boy who serves as a guide wouldn't venture there alone. Merle had to rely on you to defeat the beasts before the plant can be harvested.|
14181|#&7$Merle##br#
"Alright Haas, it's go time. %n% has done you the favor of clearing out the Sandstorm Rexes, so go on and get that Dragon Bell Grass." #M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Akara mentioned that in ancient times, reins and bridles woven of Dragon Bell Grass were used to train and control young dragons. That seems pretty important." #M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Wait, you're not coming along? It's a dangerous place; it'd be safer if we all went together."#br##br#
#&53$Haas tilts his head to the side, looking at Merle as if he'd gone crazy.##M001030$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Well, if I go too, who'll... uh... watch the cart? Gotta keep all this stuff safe, right?" #M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Well, ooooo-kay, have it your way. Come on, %n%, we can go bravely collect the grass while Merle sits here like a chump." #M001030$Haas$821$0#|
14182|#&7$Merle##br#
"Hey, %n%, gathering Dragon Bell Grass is dangerous, I know, so be careful out there. And... take care of the kid, would you?" #npc$$821$1#|
14183|#&7$Merle##br#
"Heeeey, you're back!"#br##br#
#&53$Merle seems both happy and relieved to see the two of you. You can see in his eyes that he was worried about Haas.##M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Er...hey, kid. Guess you made it back alive too, huh?"#br##br#
#&53$Merle puts on an air of casual detachment once again.##M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Well, I almost bit the dust, yeah. Good thing %n% had my back!" #br##br#
#&53$Haas smiles cheerfully; he seems to be fishing for a reaction from Merle.##M001030$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Wait? You're totally okay? Don't fib now, I'm sure you got hurt. Let me see it." #M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Eh? What are you saying? I just told you, %n% protected me through the whole thing. I guess it's true; hearing IS the first thing to go in your old age." #M001030$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"You...sonuva..."#br##br#
#&53$Merle fumes as he glares at Haas.##M101020$Merle$827$1#|
14184|After you bested the Sandstorm Rex, Haas followed you to collect Dragon Bell Grass. It's still a dangerous location, so you had to keep him safe.|
14191|#&7$Merle##br#
"Alright, seems like a 'Flower of Life' is the last item we need to get." #M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Now seems like a good time to mention that the Flower of Life grows far into the Cactus Plateau, and there are more Moas around there than you or I could make nuggets of. If we just run in to grab the flowers unawares, the results would be... painful." #M001040$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"No need to worry - I have a plan! Remember that bottle of anesthetic %n% brought earlier? Let's use that to make tranquilizing darts!"#br##br#
#&53$Merle seems quite satisfied with his burst of inspiration.##M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"We've got materials to make blowpipes in the cart, but what do you plan to make darts out of?" #M001040$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You remember your experiences in the Triatio Highlands and relate them to Merle and Haas, suggesting cactus thorns as makeshift blowdarts.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Hey now...that's not a bad idea! Alright, how about you go collect some thorns from the Needle Cactoids? I'll put together a blowpipe from whatever supplies we've got in the cart." #M101020$Merle$821$1#|
14192|#&7$Merle##br#
"All right! A bit of adhesive here, then I need to attach the endpiece... The legendary inventor McJiver could hardly make a finer blowpipe!"#br##br#
#&53$Merle rummages through the cart to find the rest of #br# the materials he needs.##npc$$821$1#|
14193|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You carefully hand the cactus thorns to Merle and his eyes widen. He looks quite impressed!##char$$1$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Whoever taught you to use cactus thorns as blowdarts has no small bit of brilliance about them, that's for certain."#br##br#
#&53$Merle inspects the thorns after praising your skills.##npc$$821$1#|
14194|Merle suggested using Akara's potent anesthetic to make tranquilizing blowdarts. Fortunately, you'd been in a situation like this before, in the Triatio Highlands, and suggested using cactus thorns as makeshift darts.|
14201|#&7$Haas##br#
"%n%, you're going out to collect cactus thorns, right? Could you do a little favor for me too?" #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"When you go out to collect the thorns, could you collect the cactus flowers too? Those flowers have medicinal uses, and I can sell them for a good price. So basically, I want to sell the flowers to medicine shops and make a little extra money for my family. You think you can help me out?" #npc$$821$1#|
14202|#&7$Haas##br#
"Living in the desert is really difficult. That's why I'm helping the caravan - to earn a little extra money on the side. Whatever odd job or loot I can score, I'll take it." #npc$$821$1#|
14203|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the cactus flowers to Haas. You collected quite a few!##char$$822$0# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Woooow, look at all these flowers! Score!"#br##br#
#&53$Haas leaps up with excitement at the impressive haul of cactus flowers you brought back for him.##npc$$825$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Thank you, %n%. You've really helped me out - more than you know."#npc$$821$1#|
14204|Knowing that you were headed out to collect cactus thorns, Haas asked you to gather cactus flowers, too. He aims to sell the blossoms to medicine shops to earn money for his family.|
14211|#&7$Merle##br#
"You should know, we don't have enough of the anesthetic to tranquilize every Moa." #npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Fortunately, it's a very potent anesthetic. If we focus our attention on the big one, Kakkan, that'd probably be the most efficient use of our supplies. How about this: while we soak the darts in the anesthetic, you clear us a path to Kakkan. That'll give us a clear shot #br# at the Moa King." #npc$$821$1#|
14212|#&7$Merle##br#
"Whoa, kid! I've already soaked those darts in the anesthetic! Don't toss them at me!"#M101020$Merle$823$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"You've got reflexes. You can dodge, right? Or are you too creepy and ooooold?"#M001040$Haas$821$0#|
14213|#&7$Merle##br#
"Oh... You're back..." #br##br#
#&53$Merle sounds unusually discouraged, so you ask him what happened.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Some giant sand roach... bug... thing came right outta nowhere! Haas and I are alright, but our blowpipes got busted up. Soooo, yeah. We can't use that plan anymore."#npc$$821$1#|
14214|Without much of Akara's anesthetic remaining, Merle decides to focus your group's efforts on the Moa King, Kakkan. Merle wants you to kill some of the Moas to clear a path while he and Haas soak the darts in the tranquilizing anesthetic.|
14221|#&7$Merle##br#
"Curse these desert beasts, busting up our blowpipe scheme. I worked so hard on those blowpipes! I even tried to figure out other ways to shoot our darts, but nothing else would really work." #M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"If all you need is a hollow tube, we might be able to use the shafts of Moa feathers to make blowpipes. Maybe our plan can be salvaged after all."#M001030$Haas$828$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"That's it! Sometimes you actually come up with something impressive, kid. We'll clean some Moa feathers and find the best quills to make new blowpipes."#M101020$Merle$824$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Wait, haven't I been totally resourceful and impressive all along? I only have to butt in all the time because you never bother asking my opinion."#M001040$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
#&53$Merle rolls his eyes at Haas.##br##br#
"Bah, whatever. Anyway, let's have %n% be in charge of bringing back Imperial Moa quills. I'll get all the tools set up to strip the shafts and turn them into pipes."#M101020$Merle$821$1#|
14222|#&7$Merle##br#
"Alright, you've got the Imperial Moa feathers, right? Don't forget to strip them down to the shaft, otherwise we won't be able to tell which ones would make the best blowpipes."#npc$$821$1#|
14223|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Merle the stripped quills that you gathered. Hopefully, at least one of them will be good enough to be made into a blowpipe.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Merle##br#
"Ah, %n%, these quills are all nearly perfect for making blowpipes out of. However, we really only need one of them..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"Well, at least we have backups in case we botch our blowpipe making! Let's get to work!"#br##br#
#&53$Merle takes out his tools and begins to fashion the quills into blowpipes.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Haas##br#
"Um..."#M001040$Haas$821$0#

#&7$Merle##br#
"Hmm? What is it, Haas?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Haas##br#
"Um...if...if only one quill is used... Can I have the rest of them?"#M001040$Haas$821$0#

#&7$Merle##br#
"You just want to sell them, huh?! Is money all you think about! Fine, whatever, you can have the extras!"#br##br#
#&53$Merle huffs in frustration while busily crafting the blowpipe.##npc$$821$1#|
14224|After an unexpected attack left all the cobbled-together blowpipes broken, Haas came up with the idea to collect Imperial Moa feathers to find a nice, hollow shaft. That might help salvage the plan to use tranquilizing darts.|
14231|#&7$Merle##br#
"Well, it could be better, but you shouldn't have a problem if you use this one."#br##br#
#&53$Merle puts down his knife and passes you the newly-fashioned blowpipe.##M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"%n%, one thing you have to promise me is that you won't kill the Moa King, under any circumstances. If you do that, all the moas will riot and stampede, and all the people who live in the desert will be put in danger."#M001040$Haas$821$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"What?! Why didn't you tell me that earlier? Ah, whatever. Just fill that big ol' bird full of tranquilizer needles, then run in there and grab the Flower of Life while it's out."#M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Sorry this hasn't been as easily in-and-out as we'd initially planned. Be careful out there."#M101020$Merle$821$1#|
14232|#&7$Merle##br#
"Okay %n%, I know it's super important to nab that Flower of Life and all, but like the kid said, don't kill the Moa King, or the folks living in this desert will be in danger."#npc$$821$1#|
14233|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You present the Flower of Life to Merle. The sense of a marvellous power that you feel from simply holding it is something you don't think you'll ever be able to describe.##char$$822:0$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Is that the Flower of Life? Ah, it even looks kinda special. I wonder what Akara needs it for."#M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"I'm not really sure, but it IS important. The elders of the village say these flowers were left in the desert like jewels, when the world was created."#M001040$Haas$821$1# 

#&7$%p%##br#
"I think this Akara guy wants to imbue the dragon egg with the energy from the Flower of Life. It is sorta similar to %n%'s powers, so it might be able to break the seal."#pet$$821$0# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Do you think the egg will hatch?! This is so exciting! I can't wait!"#M001040$Haas$825$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"Hey, %n%..."#br##br#
#&53$Merle looks at you, smiling mysteriously.##M101020$Merle$1$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"I just heard some news from our Expedition Team. Akara has successfully led them to the Ruins of Sand!"#M101020$Merle$824$1#|
14234|With all the preparations made, Haas suddenly warned you not to kill the Moa King. If you do, the Moas would stampede through the desert, attacking people indiscriminately.|
14241|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Excited to hear the news of Akara and the Expedition Team's discovery, you ask Merle for any details about their exploration.##char$$806:71$0# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"The entire Expedition Team is still exploring the ruins. At long last we're finally nearing a result to all our years of exploration! Considering all the hardships we've gone through over the years, it's a great feeling to finally have something for our work!"#M101020$Merle$828$1# 

#&7$Merle##br#
"I heard that Akara's returned to the tower. We must uphold our end of the bargain, %n%. You must help him hatch that ancient dragon egg!"#M101020$Merle$821$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"%n%, I leave the cart in your hands. I'm going with Haas to visit his village and see how the locals are faring, as well as deliver all the money he's earned out here."#M101020$Merle$821$1# 

#&7$Haas##br#
"Yeah! Money time!"#M001040$Haas$824$0#|
14242|#&7$Akara##br#
"Ah! So you've finally returned, %n%. You have everything from the list, correct?"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14243|#&7$Akara##br#
"Hmm... Let's see here..."#br##br#
#&53$Akara rummages through the cart, checking each item carefully, one by one.##npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After delivering the cart to Akara, you tell him the events of Cactus Plateau, but he doesn't seem to be listening.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"How nice... Let's see... Hmmm, mucus to accelerate the reaction... Strong reins for training, and most important... The Flower of Life."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"You've followed my instructions to the letter. Impressive. Seems like my hunch to trust you with the preparations paid off."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"As per our agreement, %n%, I have successfully guided your friends through the dunes and led them to the discovery of the Ruins of Sands."#npc$$2$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"It's now the time for you to uphold your part of the bargain: help me hatch that dragon egg!"#npc$$821$1#|
14244|After much work and many trials, the cart had finally been filled with everything Akara requested. You pulled the cart back to him to inspect the materials.|
14251|#&7$Akara##br#
"With everything prepared, we can now proceed with the plan. Do you know what the purpose of this mucus is?"#br##br#
#&53$Akara lifts the crystal bottle of mucus and gives it a shake.##npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shake your head - you have no idea what mucus could do to hatch an egg. You recall Merle suggesting that the temperature of the mucus might be necessary in hatching the dragon egg, but you're not so sure...##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Hmm, those Sanknie merchants are really creative! However, that's not quite the right reason. The warmth of the mucus is going to actually be used on the Flower of Life."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"We Dwarves have a knack for extracting Life Energy from nature. Always careful to keep everything in balance, we use this technique commonly for our mechanical experiments, however it can also be applied in this situation."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Akara if there is anything you can do to help.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Alright, here's what you can do. Take out the Thermal Crystal Bottle and pour the liquid over the Flower of Life. That'll strip the life particles from the blossom so that we can collect them."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"When you've collected those particles, bring them to me. I'll melt them down and mix them into a substance known as the 'Essence of Life.' Now, let us begin!"#npc$$821$1#|
14252|#&7$Akara##br#
"It's not often I have to revise my opinion, but in spite of my initial misgivings, you're quite pleasant to work with. Unlike those hare-brained mercenaries, you've got a good head on your shoulders, %n%. There'd been no shortage of troubles before you showed up." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14253|#&7$Akara##br#
"Careful now, these are extremely valuable!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After pouring the mucus mixture over the Flower of Life, the particles of life were gently stripped away. You carefully collect them in the palm of your hand and present them to Akara.##char$$822:0$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
#&53$Ever so gently, Akara takes the potent life particles from your hand.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Though small, these motes contain a wondrous power. If we were careless and spilled them on the ground, all sorts of plants would spring forth on that spot."#npc$$827$1#|
14254|Akara wants you to take the Thermal Crystal Bottle from the cart and pour its volatile contents onto the Flower of Life, to strip potent 'life particles' from the petals.|
14261|#&7$Akara##br#
"Now, we'll blend these particles in a mixture used in ancient times, adding some of these liquids and pouring the concoction into the bottle."#br##br#
#&53$Akara's hands work quickly as he mixes a potent tincture of life particles.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are suddenly reminded of your time in Cactakara Forest, except instead of green forest, you are surrounded by desert. Instead of being surrounded by intricate machines, you see only the equipment of an adventurer.##char$$1$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"And with that, the mixture is complete. What comes next must be done by an Envoy of Gaia. Come, let me show you how it's done."#br##br#
#&53$Akara hands you a bottle filled with the Essence of Life.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"You'll need to drink the Essence of Life..."#npc$$2$1# 

#&7$%p%##br#
"Wait! Is it safe for %n% to drink the Essence of Life? I thought we'd use it on the dragon egg!"#pet$$824$0# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Calm down, listen to me! This will not harm %n%! You will be filled with the power of creation, then pass that power on to the dragon egg. If this goes as planned, the egg should be revived and hatch into an infant dragon."#npc$$821$1#|
14262|#&7$Akara##br#
"We're pressing into unknown territory at this point. No one alive today has ever attempted something like this."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14263|#&7$Akara##br#
"Hurry up and give it to me!"#br##br#
#&53$Akara nervously takes the sleeping infant dragon from your hands.##npcs85h+70$$821$1# 

#&7$Akara##br#
"Ah, such a beautiful little creature. Don't you worry, I'll take good care of you."#br##br#
#&53$Akara seems to be oblivious to your presence, fully focused on the tiny dragon.##npc$$821$1#|
14264|Akara gave you a bottle filled with the precious Essence of Life. You're supposed to drink it, and transfer the concentrated life force to the dragon egg.|
14271|#&7$Akara##br#
"Look at that. A real beauty, isn't it? I've never seen such a beautiful infant dragon before. I mean, who wouldn't love this face?"#M143020s85h+70$Akara$821$1# 

#&7$Expedition Team Member##br#
"A-Akara! We're in big trouble! We need your help! We were attacked by some kind of creature we've never seen! What should we do?" #M123020$Expedition Team$826$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with me. I believe we've already fulfilled the terms of our agreement." #M143020$Akara$821$1# 

#&7$Expedition Team Member##br#
"What...?"#br##br#
#&53$The Expedition Team Member looks at Akara, mouth hanging open in surprise.##M123020$Expedition Team$823$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"My my, you lot sure do find new and interesting ways to get into a fix. How about it, %n%, do you want to help them out?" #M143020$Akara$821$1#|
14272|#&7$Omar##br#
"%n%? What are you doing here?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar seems surprised by your sudden appearance.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Well, whatever. We could use your help getting those creepy creatures out of here!"#npc$$821$1#|
14273|#&7$Omar##br#
"Phew! If you hadn't shown up, I don't know how we would've dealt with that."#br##br#
#&53$Omar looks relieved after seeing you vanquish the nearby monsters.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After catching your breath, you ask Omar what's been going on with the expedition to the ruins.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"While you were tending to the dragon egg, Akara guided us through the dunes. When we finally caught sight of the ancient ruins, the entire team jumped for joy! Akara seemed completely disinterested and left without a word, oddly enough. However, we hardly noticed as we were so busy exploring..."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"It would seem that we are not the first to discover this particular ruin."#npc$$826$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You are surprised to hear that this ancient ruin, long sought after by the Sanknie Alliance, had already been discovered by someone unknown...##char$$823$0# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"Some of the seals to the ruins had been broken so clumsily, it could only have been done by an ignorant outsider..."#br##br#
#&53$Omar's squints as he looks off into the distance, seemingly perplexed.##npc$$828$1# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"The destruction caused by the outsider looks very recent. We must pick up the pace! I don't know how many competitors we have who are also searching for treasure."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Omar, the competitors may be the least of our problems. We have many more dangerous issues to concern ourselves with!"#br##br#
#&53$A nearby scholar walks up, interrupting the conversation.##M119020$Sherman$821$0# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"You're right, Sherman. With the seals broken, it seems the guardians of the ruins have been awakened. Many strange and mystical creatures have appeared and attacked our team. In all that chaos, we had no choice but to retreat back here."#npc$$821$1#|
14274|Right after the dragon egg had hatched, a member of the expedition team  came running to see Akara. Breathless, she told you that the expedition had been attacked by some kind of unknown creature. After Akara's prodding, you jump into action to help them out.|
14281|#&7$Omar##br#
"When we retreated, the ruins had already been occupied by a bunch of those creepy creatures."#npc$$821$1##&PP01102# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"Their upper body is normal, like a human's, but they've got a bottom like a snake! Just thinking about it gives me the willies! They've put a bunch of my people in a trance and we have no idea what to do about it!"#npc$$827$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It seems that while the Expedition Team was exploring the ruins, the last thing on their mind was encountering strange creatures... What were they thinking? Ruins always come with strange creatures...##char$$806:0$0# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"The actual area of ruins is rather small, but since our team members keep getting hypnotized, we're having trouble locating the creatures. I think that, if we don't handle these creatures here and now, the entire Star Plan will be in jeopardy."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Omar that you will look into the situation and take care of the strange creatures that have taken over the ruins. Perhaps, then you will be able to devise a way to counter the trances too.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"The entire expedition is resting on your shoulders now. You're a member of this team, and right now we need your special brand of power to thrash these... these Succubi!"#npc$$821$1#|
14282|#&7$Omar##br#
"I've asked everyone on the team, recruited from the most elite of archaeologists, but no one has seen anything like these monsters before. Where do they even come from?" #npc$$821$1#|
14283|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After driving off the Succubi, you report back to Omar.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"Fine work, %n%! Fine work indeed! You drove them off with real panache. I'm glad you're on our team!"#br##br#
#&53$Omar breathes a sigh of relief, but you can tell he's still worried.##npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Omar##br#
"While you were dealing with those wretched Succubi, some of my bravest team members went in search of whatever's causing all these trances. At the moment, we're waiting for them to report back."#npc$$821$1# 

#&7$Sherman##br#
"%n%, while we wait for that report, perhaps you could help me investigate the creatures coming from the ruins. We must find a way to get rid of them!"#M119020$Sherman$821$0#|
14284|When the expedition team retreated from the ruins, they found that the creatures had followed them. If the creatures are not stopped, the Star Plan will be in jeopardy.|
14291|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You approach Sherman and ask how you can be of assistance.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"We can't go on like this - we need to find out where these creatures are coming from. And we can't let %n% just shoulder that burden alone, can we?"#M119020$Sherman$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I know, I know. But...are you sure you can find where they come from? There is no mention of them in any records I've ever laid eyes on."#M112030$Omar$821$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Of all the ruins we've been to, which ones HAVEN'T had something we've never seen before?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar could only nod in agreement, leaving the situation to Sherman's discretion.##M119020$Sherman$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$It seems like Sherman's next step is to more thoroughly investigate the creatures that have been assaulting the Expedition Teams. Perhaps the monsters themselves have some clues.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Well...you know the score, %n%. I'd like you to bring back anything you can from those creatures - scales perhaps, or claws. I'll try to glean more info from those."#M119020$Sherman$821$1#|
14292|#&7$Sherman##br#
"What the heck's going on here?"#npc$$821$1#|
14293|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After battling the Warlocks and Witches of the Ruins, you've managed to obtain the claws and scales that Sherman needs to perform his experiments. He intends to figure  these strange creatures out, searching for a weakness.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Look at these scales. Look at these CLAWS!"#br##br#
#&53$Sherman seems to wince as he holds up a sharp, curved talon. Is that fear in his eyes?##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"One thing I can say - we're probably not gonna get these guys to the negotiating table."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"I will start the my research straight away. Some of the Expedition Team members have just returned with their reports. I suggest you go to Omar and find out what's going on."#br##br#
#&53$Sherman takes the claws and scales and dives into research mode.##npc$$821$1#|
14294|Sherman didn't want you to have to handle everything on your own, so he decided to use his knowledge of biology to study the potential weaknesses of the strange creatures. He needs you to bring back claws and scales from the Ruins Warlocks and Ruins Witches to examine.|
14301|#&7$Omar##br#
"Just in time, %n%. Our Expedition Team thinks they've found the source of the trances. Tell %n% what you've learned."#br##br#
#&53$Omar beckons one of his team members over.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Expedition Team Member##br#
"Right. Well, first we tried wearing instruments that would cause interference to normal means of transfixion, but those were useless. The moment we stepped into the ruins, several of our team completely lost themselves to the trance. They looked like they had seen some horrible illusion."#M123020$Expedition Team$822$0#

#&7$Expedition Team Member##br#
"Suddenly, everyone lost the ability to distinguish between reality and illusion. We had no way of telling friend from foe... So we had to get out of there as soon as possible."#M123020$Expedition Team$828$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Get to the point! %n% needs to know about the source that you found."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Expedition Team Member##br#
"Er, right, sorry sir. There were some strange crystals floating within the Ruins. The people who managed to regain their senses all said they saw them before they started to hallucinate..."#M123020$Expedition Team$823$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"There you have it. It's those crystals, %n%. Yet, somehow, when you went to deal with those strange creatures you were not effected. Did you not see the floating blue crystals?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You don't recall feeling any particular discomfort or seeing anything strange. Since the interference instruments had no effect, you tell Omar that you suspect the trances are caused by an ancient and unusual magic.##char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"I agree! It must be something magical. These kinds of things easily overpower a normal person who may have trouble maintaining their focus. An Envoy of Gaia, like %n%, is a completely different matter!"#br##br#
#&53$%p% nods.##pet$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Since you're immune, I'd like you to delve into the ruins and destroy those crystals so the rest of the expedition can move in."#npc$$821$1#|
14302|#&7$Omar##br#
"I'm sorry, %n% - as long as those crystals are in the ruins, we can't go in and help you. Worse still, we could unintentionally put you at greater risk."#npc$$821$1#|
14303|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having destroyed all the crystals within the ruins, you return to see Omar and Sherman having a loud discussion. It would seem they've discovered something rather disturbing.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"How is that even possible? Are you messing with me?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar shouts.##M112030$Omar$821$1#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Look, I can understand your dismay, but I've checked my results five times, and I've gotten the same result each time."#br##br#
#&53$Sherman shrugs helplessly.##M119020$Sherman$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report the situation and ask them what's going on. They both look to one another and Sherman lets out a long sigh.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Well, despite the external differences... these monsters are uncannily similar to humans structurally."#M119020$Sherman$827$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"I think... these creatures actually used to BE human. The residents of the temple, I'd guess."#M119020$Sherman$828$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Ozymand Temple... if this is what comes out of it, what kind of secrets does conceal? What could have happened in there?"#M112030$Omar$821$1#|
14304|Omar discussed the cause of the illusions within the ruins, and agreed that they were being projected by the crystals the team had seen. You were not affected by the illusions, so the task of destroying the crystals to make the ruins safe fell to you.|
14311|#&7$Sherman##br#
"Those monsters we're seeing - they're not really 'alive' in the same sense as we are. They're like puppets. So the question then becomes, 'What is making them move?'" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"The most likely cause is some sort of unknown power. The more we examine these creatures, the closer we'll come to unraveling this riddle." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"%n%, would you be willing to head back into the ruins? I think bringing back anything of the Sandstorm Magi would give us some clues, at least." #npc$$821$1#|
14312|#&7$Sherman##br#
"We need an answer as soon as possible..." #npc$$821$1#|
14313|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having secured some Dark Soul Cores from the Sandstorm Magi, you return and hand them over to Sherman.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"This thing looks... unsavory."#br##br#
#&53$Sherman looks uncomfortable as he examines it.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"You should have no trouble identifying this, right Sherman? We need to work quickly - our competitors must be gaining on us! Who knows what they were up to while %n% was collecting these cores and fighting off the Sandstorm Magi..."#M112030$Omar$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"We must hurry and get back to exploring the temple!"#br##br#
#&53$Omar furrows his brow.##M112030$Omar$828$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
#&53$Sherman continues to observe the core for some time, talking as he goes.##br##br#
"Hmm... just as I theorized. These devilish creatures, the illusionary crystals... all signs point to the Ozymand Temple."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"What are you implying?"#M112030$Omar$823$0#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Magic that cannot be seen with the naked eye is pouring out of the Ozymand Temple like an unstoppable river. Our destination is perilous..."#npc$$821$1#|
14314|Sherman's research indicates that the creatures are not really living creatures, but puppets being manipulated by some outside force. Sherman asked you to delve into the ruins once more and bring back anything you can take from the the Sandstorm Magi.|
14321|#&7$Omar##br#
#&53$Omar seems completely lost in thought. He lowers his head silently for quite a while.##M112030$Omar$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Could this mean that there are even more dangers inside Ozymand Temple? Omar must be worried about his team encountering even more terrible obstacles on their journey.##char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Just before you say something, Omar raises his head and smiles, looking determined.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Sherman just brought me up to speed. It seems like it's time to venture into Ozymand Temple."#br##br#
#&53$Omar looks toward the ruins looming in the distance.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"We're still not quite sure where the temple entrance is. There are many gates, but only one true entrance - the others are death traps. I'm hoping we can use magic to find our way in."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Sherman... can you do it?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar stares at his associate.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Sherman##br#
"Yeah. Using the instruments won't be a problem. My only concern is the obstacles."#br##br#
#&53$Sherman points at Ozymand Temple.##br##br#
"According to various reports, as soon as we begin to approach, the guards will be upon us."#M119020$Sherman$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Okay then. %n%, in this party, you'll serve as our vanguard. I doubt those Sand Cave Guards will just step aside and let us into the ruins."#npc$$821$1#|
14322|#&7$Omar##br#
"Alright, let's hop to it! We're behind schedule already, and I don't want Hayes breathing down my neck more than I'm sure he already plans to." #npc$$821$1#|
14323|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After successfully clearing the Sand Cave Guards, you return to the meeting point and discover that all the Expedition Team Members are... still there.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"%n%! You're back..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Omar why the Expedition Team is still sitting around and not heading towards the entrance? While you were battling the Sand Cave Guards was the perfect opening!##char$$823$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"You're right, that was the perfect time. There wasn't a thing standing in our way. We could have entered the Ozymand Temple just as we planned..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Unfortunately, our vanguard team discovered something very strange at the entrance. It seems that someone has already entered temple. I don't know how they found the entrance, but whoever it was threw caution to the winds and just waltzed right in!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I'm afraid this guy is still in the temple. It doesn't even matter who it is at this point. He's activated all the temple's defense mechanisms!"#br##br#
#&53$Omar looks furious. Whoever messed up his plans better watch out!##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Thanks to this fool, the entrance to the Ozymand Temple is guarded by a powerful demon. But that's not all - Sherman's instruments are telling us that the entrance is now sealed shut!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I've just sent someone to deliver the news to Hayes. He is NOT gonna like this." #npc$$821$1#|
14324|Omar prepped the expedition team to head back into Ozymand Temple, asking you to take out the Sand Cave Guards while the team prepares to enter.|
14331|#&7$Omar##br#
"How could the entrance be blocked? What are we gonna do?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar wrings his hands.##M112030$Omar$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You consider challenging the Gatekeeper on your own, but even if you did, you still wouldn't be able to break the seal.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"%n%, I sense a super powerful magical energy... The entrance is completely sealed by evil! You shouldn't just rush into this, no way!"#pet$$1001$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"We have to find the source of the seal, first."#br##br#
#&53$%p% looks worried that you might rush in and hurt yourself!##pet$$1001$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I don't see a way to get through this new obstacle... It looks like there's no way in or out of the Ozymand Temple now!"#M112030$Omar$828$1#

#&7$Tina##br#
#&53$As Omar sighs in anguish, Tina suddenly rushes over. She looks really worked up about something.##M106010$Tina$101$0#

#&7$Tina##br#
"%n%! Oh, %n%, I finally found you! Akara says he has something for you. Come with me! Hurry!"#M106010$Tina$827$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Tina? The situation over here is dire. Do you really need %n%? Has word of our failed expedition made it back to the Alliance already?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar looks worried.##M112030$Omar$821$1#

#&7$Tina##br#
"It has. Everyone knows what's going on here. After Akara heard the news, he stressed to me that something extremely important has arisen and he needs %n%'s help!"#br##br#
#&53$Tina turns to look at you.##M106010$Tina$821$0#

#&7$Tina##br#
"Come quickly, %n%, I'll explain on the way! It'll be quite a surprise!"#M106010$Tina$821$0#

#&53$Accept this Quest to be teleported to Akara.#|
14332|#&7$Akara##br#
"It seems that things aren't going as easily as I hoped." #br#br##&53$Akara mutters.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#|

#&53$Akara nods at you as you approach.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&53$A giant white dragon stands behind Akara. He calmly reaches behind him and pats the dragon's front foot.##M034020s35h+20$Wrenna$1$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"Ah, %n%! I heard that the Expedition Team ran into some problems, yes?"#br##br#
#&53$He acts like the dragon isn't even there.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Akara that the entrance to Ozymand Temple has been blocked off, and ask him why he's called you back. Pretending the dragon isn't there is hard.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"I see. I might have a way to help you remove the seal over the Ozymand Temple..."#br##br#
#&53$He looks around nervously.##npc$$821$1#|
14334|While Omar was fretting about the closed-off temple entrance, Tina showed up, saying that Akara had something important for you to do.|
14341|#&7$Akara##br#
"It would seem introductions are in order! %n%, this beeeeautiful white dragon you see here is who you helped me to hatch! Her name is Wrenna..."#M143020s85h+70$Akara$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You suspected that was the case, but the sheer size of Wrenna still leaves you shocked. Is it rude to stare at a dragon?##M034020s35h+20$Wrenna$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Gathering your senses, you return to the matter at hand and ask Akara if he knows how to remove the seal on Ozymand Temple. You hope he has something.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"I'd like to say that I figured it out all by myself, but it was Wrenna who told me. As she grew, I started to hear her voice in my mind. Choppy and unclear at first, but I'm starting to really understand her..."#M143020$Akara$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Hearing another being's thoughts in your mind reminds you of your encounter with the Sarpa Queen back in the Candeo Marsh. You remember the strange feeling of someone else's voice directly in your head...##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"There is probably a long and interesting story behind it, but Wrenna's inherited memories have not fully taken shape. Everything is connected, %n%, even this seal that you want to break."#M143020$Akara$2$1#

#&7$Akara##br#
"%n%, climb aboard Wrenna here. Astride a dragon, you'll be able to confront Imadal, the temple's gatekeeper."#M143020$Akara$821$1#

#&53$Accept this Quest to begin Wrenna's first battle.#|
14342|#&7$Omar##br#
"..."#npc$$821$1#|
14343|#&7$Omar##br#
"So let me get this straight. That person riding on the back of a dragon was YOU?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar blinked, not certain what had happened.##M112030$Omar$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nodded to Omar, and added that the path to Ozymand Temple should be all clear for exploration now.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I didn't expect...to be involved with this horrible war. Now there's even a dragon!"#M112030$Omar$821$1#

#&7$Akara##br#
"%n%, Wrenna, my thanks to both of you. Your battle was most impressive." #M143010s85h+70$Akara$821$1#

#&7$Akara##br#
"Alas, I'm afraid I must take Wrenna back to get some rest. She's just a baby, after all." #M143010$Akara$821$1#|
14344|While neither you nor Akara know how the giant dragon, Wrenna, is connected to the Ozymand Temple, it seems like she is the key to defeating Gatekeeper Imadal and, perhaps, breaking the seal.|
14351|#&7$Omar##br#
"Listen up, team! %n% has cleared the way into Ozymand Temple for us. So get yourselves ready, 'cause we're heading in without delay!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"It's finally time for goals to be met and dreams to come true, and it's all thanks to you. We'd probably have become nameless casualties in the desert without you."#br##br#
#&53$Omar turns his gaze to the stalwart expedition team.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Looks like they still need a bit longer before they're ready to set out. How about you go clear the path for us? We know someone's already been inside the temple, so be careful of traps that they avoided tripping." #npc$$821$1#|
14352|#&7$Omar##br#
"We've spent forever in this desert, and today is the day it finally pays off. Today, we finally enter the fabled Ozymand Temple!"#npc$$821$1#|
14353|#&7$Omar##br#
"Curse you! Give me back my gem!"#br##br#
#&53$Omar chases after Caroline, his arms flailing in anger, but you stop his pursuit.##M112030$Omar$823$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Don't stop me, %n%! I have to get that gem back. I can't afford to let it fall into the hands of someone else!" #M112030$Omar$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask him if the Sand Gem is what the Alliance was seeking.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"No, no... If you bring that gem into the temple, it can seal the power that lingers in these halls."#M112030$Omar$827$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Some sources say that the ancient kingdom fell into ruin because of that gem. If that young woman releases the power within it, will she be able to control it?" #M112030$Omar$828$1#|
14354|The expedition team prepared to head into Ozymand Temple, but Omar figured it would be best for you to go in first.

Enter Ozymand Temple (Solo) to check things out.|
14361|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You asked Omar to calm down, saying that recklessness in the temple could get him killed.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I doubt the expedition team can stop her, but maybe you can."#M112030$Omar$826$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"%n%! Go! Stop her! She's tampering with forces she doesn't comprehend. Releasing the energy of the gem could kill her!"#M112030$Omar$828$1#|
14362|#&7$Akara##br#
"Ack... what a mess."#br##br#
#&53$Akara frowns as he surveys the situation.##npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14363|#&7$Akara##br#
"%n%, I was counting on you to keep that gem safe, but I wasn't expecting that young lass to be an Envoy of Gaia as well. I suppose I'll have to plan for the worst-case scenario..." #npcs85h+70$$821$1#|
14364|Caroline burst in and stole the Sand Gem, rushing deeper into the temple. Omar worried that if she managed to unseal the gem, the power it contains would vaporize her on release. He asked you to catch Caroline and prevent her from reaching the temple's ancient seal.

Stop Caroline in Ozymand Temple (Solo).|
14371|#&7$Akara##br#
#&53$You begin to wonder what Akara could mean by "worst case scenario," but decide you'd rather not know.##M143020s85h+70$Akara$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Akara? What are YOU doing here?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar glares at Akara suspiciously.##M112030$Omar$823$1#

#&7$Akara##br#
"I was here to cure you of your chronic stupidity. But it would seem I'm too late. Wrenna's memories about the gem have matured..."#br##br#
#&53$Akara seems displeased.##M143020s85h+70$Akara$821$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"That larcenous lass has undone the ancient King's seal. The demon Talamund, who destroyed this kingdom long ago, will soon be free to show us the power that laid a kingdom to waste..."#M143020$Akara$821$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"Wrenna's ancestors were the guardians of this ancient kingdom. When some fool released Talamund into the world, Wrenna and her kind used their powers to seal this evil, resulting in them being sealed along with it..."#M143020$Akara$828$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"How... how do you know this? We have translated hundreds and hundreds of ancient texts and there's nothing - nothing! Not a word about what happened to this kingdom!"#M112030$Omar$821$1#

#&7$Akara##br#
"If we get the chance, I'll reveal it all to you. IF we get the chance. Right now, there are much more grave matters at hand."#M143020$Akara$2$0#

#&7$Akara##br#
"You two must combine your powers - human and dragon, new and old - to seal Talamund away before he can regain too much of his former might."#M143020$Akara$821$0#|
14372|#&7$Omar##br#
"Is... is it over? That was incredible."#br##br#
#&53$Omar is still trembling.##npc$$821$1#|
14373|#&7$Omar##br#
"I can barely believe it. It's like we all just had a brush with doomsday..."#br##br#
#&53$Omar breathes a sigh of relief.##npc$$821$1#|
14374|Akara caught up with you and explained that the legend of Ozymand Temple had been spread to lure Envoys of Gaia to it. Now, you face the menace of Talamund, an immortal demon who destroyed the desert kingdom in ancient times.|
14381|#&7$Omar##br#
"Hey, %n%, are you ok?"#br##br#
#&53$Omar pats your shoulder.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"I'm... really sorry about all you've been through. At least we finally found the legendary Ozymand Temple. At this point, that's about my only consolation."#br##br#
#&53$Omar laughs, sounding somewhat resigned.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Overall, though, I guess I'll take it as a success. Now, we have to start surveying the temple."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"From here on out, everything's resting on your shoulders. That's a relief to me, at least..."#br##br#
#&53$Omar lets out a sigh.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Let Hayes know how things turned out and tell him that the Star Plan was a success!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"By the way... I noticed your strange connection with that reckless, thieving girl. I'll have a word with Hayes. Perhaps we can find her family. After all, she was the one who really discovered the Ozymand Temple..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You simply nod. You're not in the mood to discuss Caroline further. You and %p% prepare to return to Hayes.##char$$828:0$0#|
14382|#&7$Hayes##br#
"Hey-hey! If it isn't %n%, back from the front! How did the expedition fare? Did you find the Ozymand Temple? Was there treasure there?"#br##br#
#&53$He throws out questions so quickly you hardly know where to start.##npc$$821$1#|
14383|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Finally making it back to the Oasis, you tell Hayes that the Star Plan has succeeded and how you basically saved the world from destruction by Talamund. You don't, however, bring up Caroline.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Excellent! Most excellent indeed."#br##br#
#&53$Hayes chortled.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"After such a long push, we finally found the Ozymand Temple. The whole Alliance will be eating crow when they find out I was right."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Seeing how happy Hayes is, you definitely decide to not bring up Caroline at all. You'll let Omar explain her part when the time is right...##char$$1$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"I'm very satisfied with the work you've done, %n% - signing you to the expedition team might have been the best investment I made. What do you say to a bump in your take - from 30% up to 40% of our haul? That ought to ease your journey back to Navea to report to the Church."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're surprised that Hayes actually remembered why you'd come here in the first place.##char$$823$0#|
14384|Though the way had been fraught with danger, the ambitious Star Plan had finally been realized. Omar wanted you to take the good news back to Hayes, in Palmgil Oasis.|
14391|#&7$Hayes##br#
"Surprised? Don't be. I was the one who asked Ben to call on you. I wanted to see if the Church really had the sincerity and determination they preach so often."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"There are plenty of treasures buried within Ozymand Temple. The Church will be able to make bank on this. And before I forget, I'd also like you to deliver a message to the Church."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"I, Hayes, as a representative of the Sanknie Alliance, do formally and solemnly swear to support the Church of Navea with goods and supplies. We offer our full cooperation in the form of sharing resources, knowledge, and manpower."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Alright, did you get all that? Good. Now, make haste, %n%! I'm doing this for your sake."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$After meeting with the Grand Bishop, you'll head out to face even greater challenges, which you must meet with greater strength. Seek out new quests from the Bulletin Board, or challenge the perils of Ghostsweep Cave, Wrathborne Temple, and Ozymand Temple.#|
14392|#&7$Belenus##br#
"..." #npc$$822$1#|
14393|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the Grand Bishop about the Sanknie Alliance's vow of full support to the Church.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"That is no small feat to have secured the support of the Sanknie Alliance. And none too soon. We will need their knowledge and resources to counteract the Shadow Knight's legions."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"All that and yet... you seem sad, somehow. Tell me, %n%, what else happened?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You recall the first time you met Caroline in Cactakara Forest,  desperate to be rid of her Eidolons.##char$$1:75$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Sorrowfully, you tell the Grand Bishop that when you fought her in Ozymand Temple, she lost herself in pursuit of power. She was willing to do anything to win.##char$$828:75$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I am sorry, my child. It is not your fault that she fell like this. Each of us decides our own path, but the reality of our choices sometimes differs greatly from our expectations."#br##br#
#&53$The Grand Bishop rests a comforting hand on your shoulder.##npc$$825$1#|
14394|After all that had happened, Hayes not only increased your share of the Alliance's take from the Ozymand Temple expedition, but also vowed the Sanknie Alliance's support of the Church in its ongoing conflict with the Shadow Knight. He sent you back to Navea to convey his message directly to the Grand Bishop himself.

Return to the Grand Bishop's audience chamber and tell him all that happened on the expedition.|
14401|#&7$Belenus##br#
"Gaia's power can manifest in many different forms. You have seen this firsthand, in the Eidolons - each looks different, but each comes about through contact with a greater being. But the people of the world... Even though they have heard of the coming of the Envoys of Gaia, they cannot distinguish between Eidolons and monsters."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You recall when you first became aware of %p%'s presence, and how the citizens of Skandia thought you were being possessed by a demon.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"History tells us that most Envoys of Gaia used their powers to fight against the forces of darkness, but that some fell prey to it and brought suffering and pain into the world."#br##br##&53$The Grand Bishop pauses, silent for a moment.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"There are those, like that young man from the port, who are unable to withstand the temptation that comes with the Eidolons. They lose themselves, in body or mind."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"It is still unknown whether you will be able to bear the full magnitude of the Eidolons' power, but there is yet time for you to grow. If you require any aid that we may offer, speak with Gus, our Guard Officer, and tell him what you need."#npc$$821$1#|
14402|#&7$Gus##br#
"..."#npc$$1$1#|
14403|#&7$Gus##br#
"Looks like Rosie was right - you ARE young! But let me say, the way you were able to handle that business with the Magic Flower in Lunarin had us impressed."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You feel a bit bashful as Gus looks you up and down, as though he can't quite believe you're who Rosie was talking about.##char$$828:75$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Sorry, didn't mean to embarrass you there. I'm Gus, the Guard Officer."#br##br#
#&53$He smiles and gives you a curt bow.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"If you're ever in trouble, or you need to make a report to the Grand Bishop, just come see me in the audience chamber - no appointment needed. You fight many battles as an Envoy of Gaia - let's not add bureaucracy to your list of troubles."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"I've heard that you're looking for a way for one to sever the link to an Eidolon. Is that true?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You purse your lips and give a resolute nod.##char$$806:75$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"We know it's technically possible - there are a few very old books in the Church's library that record someone's success in returning Eidolons to a dormant state. Unfortunately, the account includes few hard details of the method they used. Perhaps, in your travels, you'll discover how it may be done."#npc$$821$1#|
14404|When you had finished your meeting with the Grand Bishop, he told you that if you required further assistance, Guard Officer Gus was always available to lend his knowledge or give advice.

Speak with Guard Officer Gus in the church's audience chamber.|
14411|#&7$Gus##br#
"You've traveled a long way to get here. How about taking some time to see the sights and get to know the city? There are many shops and places worth a visit, and some are sure to be useful to you as you continue on your journey."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Navea is truly the jewel of the Milaner continent. It's said that it was here that the people of Terra were first instructed in the ways of legends, crafts, and even magic by divine beings who descended from the Aura Kingdom." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, remembering how from the time you were young, you always heard how Navea was a resplendent, sacred place. You tell Gus that you'd hoped to one day make the journey to Navea, but that never in your wildest dreams thought that when you finally visited the holy city, it would be as an Envoy of Gaia.##char$$1$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The Church is set to announce a writ strengthening Navea's security. For it to go over smoothly, we need the support of the city's merchants. Can you go out and explain to them what we have in mind? That would really help smooth the way for us."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, saying you're always willing to lend a hand.##char$$806:0$0##&PP00101#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Ha! If you could only see your solemn, dutiful expression right now! I'm not asking you for volunteer work, you know. There's compensation in it for you, of course. The real value,  though, is in getting to know the people of the city. You never know when you might need a service one of them provides."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Take this Declaration of Eminent Domain and start by visiting Petunia in the Dome Square. She's one of this city's most respected merchants, and getting her in agreement would be a good influence on the others."#npc$$821$1#|
14412|#&7$Petunia##br#
"Sorry sweetheart, but I'm going to take more than just your say-so to believe it. Do you have some sort of holy writ? Or maybe a Declaration of Eminent Domain? Show me some proof I can see with my own eyes." #npc$$821$1#|
14413|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Petunia sees the Declaration of Eminent Domain in your hand, but rather than looking satisfied, she seemed disappointed.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"Why didn't Gus just come over himself? It feels like ages since he's stopped by. There's a gaggle of ladies who do business in Dome Square pining to meet him!" #npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Petunia the Declaration of Eminent Domain and tell her what Gus told you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"Of course, if the Church has that large of a need for equipment, it's going to be a profitable venture for me, but still, I'm a bit surprised. Getting us on board with an actual contract? Are they planning on some kind of major deployment?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Petunia looks expectantly at you, as if requesting some kind of explanation. You can only shake your head, saying that you're not really sure what the Church's larger plan is. #char$$807:0$0#|
14414|Gus asked a favor of you: To visit the merchants in Navea's Dome Square and get them to sign the Declaration of Eminent Domain. In doing so, he reasoned, you'd be able to acquaint yourself with the people of the city and learn more about its history.

Take the Declaration of Eminent Domain to Armor Merchant Petunia in Navea's Dome Square.|
14421|#&7$Petunia##br#
"It's an unusual request for the Church to make, but it seems you don't know much more about it than I do."#br##br#
#&53$Petunia furrows her brow as she looks at you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shift a bit uncomfortably, stating again that you don't know much about the agreement.##char$$828:71$0#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"Well, I'm going to give this a thorough read-over, but don't just stand there waiting. I don't care if the Church dispatched you or not - I've got a business to run here." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"In fact, you can help compensate me for my lost time. See that circle over there? Take some of these flyers and hand them out to any travelers you see." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Petunia##br#
#&53$Petunia smiles broadly as she flops a fat stack of flyers into #br# your hands. Were you just conscripted again?##npc$$825$1#|
14422|#&7$Petunia##br#
"So many travelers out and about today! Have you passed out all the flyers? Well, keep going! I'm not even halfway through reading this yet. Amazing the kind of small print they can fit on a page these days..." #npc$$827$1#|
14423|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Petunia that you finally managed to hand out all the flyers - without even using your Eidolon to intimidate people into taking them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"Thank you. That was quite helpful. Anyway, after reading through the agreement, I've decided to sign it. Raising the city's alert level is a serious matter, so I couldn't just casually  sign without knowing what I was getting into. Time to fire up the forge and get working on that equipment! Then we can iron out everything with some fortification wizardry." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"You know about fortification, right? It's the method we use to strengthen weapons or toughen up pieces of armor." #npc$$821$1##&V0004#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"It's not exactly easy to get ahold of those scrolls, but you never know when the power or defense fortification grants could be the thing that grants you victory, or saves your skin." #npc$$821$1#|
14424|Petunia wanted you to pass out flyers to nearby travelers while she carefully read over the Declaration of Eminent Domain. 

You took a stack of flyers and strolled around near Dome Square handing them out.|
14431|#&7$Petunia##br#
#&53$Petunia hands you the signed declaration.##br##br#
"A friendly word of advice here: getting my endorsement is good but a document like this only has power if most merchants are on board with it. You need armorsmiths, weapon sellers, and item vendors all in support." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Petunia##br#
"You should go show this to Sergei. I've heard from him that weapon manufacturers are having some problems sourcing the materials they need. Going by the amounts listed in this declaration, he'll need to get those supply issues fixed YESTERDAY." #npc$$827$1#|
14432|#&7$Sergei##br#
"I'm not sure I understand you right. Let me take a look at this agreement they've written up." #npc$$827$1#|
14433|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the Declaration of Eminent Domain to Sergei.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sergei##br#
#&53$Without a word, Sergei's eyes dart over the writ. His brows furrow as he sets it down, but he signs it without further questions.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Sergei##br#
"Gus gave me a heads-up that this was coming last time I saw him, but it was only in the draft stage then."#npc$$821$1#|
14434|After waiting through her analysis, you finally got Petunia to sign on to the agreement, but there were still other merchants you needed to visit and collect signatures from. Petunia told you to pay a visit to Sergei, who runs the weapon shop.

Show the Declaration of Eminent Domain to Sergei the Weapon merchant.|
14441|#&7$Sergei##br#
"Those who craft weapons know that the finest ore comes from the Demarech Mines. Thing is, we haven't received any shipments from them for a while."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask why the mines haven't sent anything to Navea, and whether you should pass this info on to Gus.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Sergei##br#
"It's okay; Gus already knows. He told me the Church is currently investigating the matter, but seemed cagey when I asked for more details. I'll bring it up with him later."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sergei##br#
"You should take this to Eve the Grocer and let her have a look at it."#npc$$821$1#|
14442|#&7$Eve##br#

#&53$You tell Eve that you came to show her the Church's Declaration of Eminent Domain, but when you reach for the document, you find it missing.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Eve##br#
"Eh? A Declaration of Eminent Domain? Well, show it to me, then. You were at Sergei's before coming here, right? Maybe you left it there - why not go and check?" #npc$$825$1#|
14443|#&7$Eve##br#
"If this didn't come from Gus, I'd think it was some kind of practical joke."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Eve##br#
"Gus seems to be a busy man these days. Even the knights are seldom in town for more than a day or two at a time. Something must be happening, right?"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're still wondering why all the merchant ladies would want to meet Gus...##char$$828$0#

#&7$Eve##br#
#&53$Eve smiles, seeming to read your thoughts through your expression.##br##br#
"Don't worry - I won't blab this around to the citizens. I know Gus would be annoyed if this whole matter caused the people of the city to worry."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Eve##br#
"But, if I'm going to make this much medicine, I'll need a lot of herbs, and it'll probably take a while to get a stable supply."#br##br#
#&53$Eve ponders the preparations she would have to make as she signs the agreement.##npc$$821$1#|
14444|Sergei told you he'd discuss an agreement for providing weapons with Gus personally, and told you to pay a visit to Eve, the proprietor of the item shop.

"Most of what I use in my potions comes from Cactakara Forest. Every year, around this time, the folks who normally collect herbs are all agog over that robot competition they have."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Eve##br#
"You should visit them sometime. The Dwarves out in Cactakara Forest are real wizards with machines. I've heard they can even convert plant energy into mechanical energy - that's wild!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and take back the paper from Eve, noticing that there are still some blank lines awaiting signatures.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Eve##br#
"You should take this to the bank now, to make it official. That'd be Thorne you need to speak to - he's in the south of the square, and I'm sure seeing this will fire up his curiosity."#npc$$821$1#|
14452|#&7$Thorne##br#
"Hmm... Even from the back, I can tell that's the guy. Now... Do I ask the guards for help, or catch him myself?"#br##br#
#&53$Thorne ponders aloud, before taking notice of your presence.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"Eh? What do you want? If you're not here on business, just let me focus. If it's important... Well, you'll have to prove it." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You reach for the Declaration of Eminent Domain, but find that it's missing! You should hurry back to Eve, and see if she still has it.##char$$823:0$0#|
14453|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand the document, now with many merchants' signatures, to Thorne.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"Alright, let me see what you've got."#br##br#
#&53$Thorne takes the document from you and he begins to quickly scan the papers, a frown slowly forming on his face.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"Well, you weren't kidding about it being an important matter. I'll have to make it a top priority for the moment, to ensure the city's merchants have no trouble in funding their shipments. I guess it's that swindler's lucky day..." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Thorne what happened, wondering if you might be able to lend a hand.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"You're on commission from the Guard Officer, correct? Maybe you can help me catch a thief. They made a clean getaway with a valuable deposit, and now I don't know how to break it to the client."#npc$$828$1#|
14454|With all the merchants' signatures on the Declaration of Eminent Domain, you need to deliver it to the bank to officialize the agreement.

"Not too long ago, a very important client deposited some valuable jewelry with us for safekeeping. But while the jewelry was being transported to the vault, one of the set's crowning pieces - a necklace - was stolen." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You see why Thorne was fretting over the theft, and ask if he has any leads.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"Right then, I saw a small figure clutching the necklace, making a getaway. He was small, but really quick on his feet. I've already asked the city's gatekeepers to keep their eyes out for the necklace or anyone meeting the description of the culprit, but so far, nothing." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"A few days go by, and then, just now, I thought I saw him. A guy who looks just like the thief, wandering around the square. Either he's here to unload the necklace to a buyer, or he's canvassing the area for new victims." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"While I work on processing the Declaration of Eminent Domain, I'd like you to look into this thief and, if you can, recover the necklace."#npc$$828$1#|
14462|#&7$Thorne##br#
"If it's an urgent request from the Church, I have to get on it right away. When it's an agreement that provides armor and weapons to troops, that means the lives of allies may hang in the balance."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"But... This is the first time I've ever had a client's valuables stolen. That thief was just too fast... Have you really not found any leads yet, %n%?" #npc$$827$1#|
14463|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Thorne that the thief was none other than Fleet-Footed Andy, and hand the stolen Ruby Necklace to him.##char$$803:0$0#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"This... It's really the stolen necklace! How did you- wait, I'm not sure I'd believe you if you told me."#br##br#
#&53$Thorne's eyes, previously glued to a pile of documents, seem to sparkle with joy.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"The owner of that necklace is a bigwig with the Sanknie Alliance on the Watt mainland. If we fumbled our dealings with them, we'd lose so many business opportunities it'd make  my head spin."#npc$$824$1#|
14464|As Thorne pored over the details of the Declaration of Eminent Domain, he asked you to find the jewelry that was stolen from the bank. The suspect, he reasoned, would still be lurking in the area, seeking to offload his ill-gotten gain.

Find Fleet Footed Andy near the bank and knock him down to snatch the Ruby Necklace back from him.|

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Thorne about your simple origins, and of how you were able to meet the Grand Bishop through a recommendation from Anya in Crescent Hill.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Thorne##br#
"Anya's got the grit to match her beauty. I hope you weren't put off too much initially by her demeanor. She - and anyone who makes it into the Templars - has the skill to back up a good deal of boasting. Maybe you can learn something from her." #npc$$824$1#

#&53$You're just about to tell Anya what the Grand Bishop said to you, but before you can start, she cuts in.##char$$821$0#

"I'm not your superior; you don't have to report to me. You're an Envoy of Gaia - you've got a job to do, just as I do. But no matter what happens... Promise me  you won't lose yourself." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You begin to notice that Anya seems to make things sound gloomy when she talks about them. And judging by her expression, she noticed that you noticed it.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Ahem. Anyway, we've received some unusual reports from the Navea's eastern ward, and you've come back just in time to assist with our investigation."#npc$$823$1#|

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Perhaps it is no less than fate that let you to us, %n%. We found ourselves reeling from the loss of an important ally, and you appeared, as though to fill the void. Your connection  to the power of Gaia is extremely strong."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, trying to wrap your head around the Grand Bishop's words.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Now, recent events have brought the Cube of Gaia into our modern age - it has been unearthed in a dig at the Demarech Mines." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Unfortunately, not long after it was discovered, the Cube of Gaia fell into the hands of sinister forces. To put it to you plainly, the Church needs your help, %n%." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Questions swim through your mind - can you really take on a challenge this great? But perhaps... If you can control the power of Gaia and skillfully command the Eidolons...  You nod your head, assenting to the task.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Good, good. Take this letter to The Military Hall and give it to Andre, commander of the Templars. He'll know what to do." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Enemies will give you no quarter - to deal with them effectively, you must become proficient in more than a single weapon. Let Andre give you instruction in advanced fighting skills."#npc$$822$1#|

"Halt! This is a military stronghold. State your name and business." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Well then, you've found him - I am Andre, commander of the Templars. Now, let me see that letter - and quickly - or you'll be leaving this base in shackles."#npc$$821$1#|
14483|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You stand, stunned by the forceful man before you, recalling your awakening as an Envoy of Gaia. In your dream, you fought alongside him against a demonic legion.##br##br#

#&53$You now know that man is Andre, commander of the Church's Templars, and pause nervously as he peruses the letter.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
#&53$Andre glances from the letter, then up to you, then back to the letter, a suspicious look in his eyes.##br##br#
"Your name is %n%, correct?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nervously introduce yourself. Although Andre's demeanor is completely different than in your dream, his voice is exactly the same as you remember.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Let's not waste time on pleasantries. Frankly, I don't think much of you 'Envoys of Gaia'."#br##br#
#&53$He paused, casting a piercing gaze at %p%.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"I don't know how you managed to gain the Grand Bishop's trust - he's asking me here to break my principles by teaching you how to wield a second weapon, and even arranged for you to take on missions under my command. Those are Templar matters, not childrens' games."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"However...I cannot disobey an order from the Grand Bishop, so listen up, because I won't repeat myself. Battle is not funny. War is not a game. If you take it lightly, you're going to get hurt, or worse. If you think you're up to it, choose a weapon and show me what you can do." #npc$$821$1#|
14484|The Grand Bishop hoped that as an Envoy of Gaia, you could contribute to the Church's cause. When you promised him your allegiance, he sent you to the Templar Commander, Andre, to learn advanced skills with a second weapon.

14491|#&7$Andre##br#
"You pick things up fast. Have you ever had any military training?"#br##br#
#&53$Andre looks a bit surprised.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell him you come from Port Skandia, a small fishing village, and you came here searching for a way to separate yourself from your Eidolon.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Hmm... I see. But if you want to be an asset to the Templars, you'll need more than just this."#br##br#
#&53$You can sense a little less hardness in Andre's voice, compared to before.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"I've dispatched a squad of Templars to investigate the Demarech Mines. I'd like you to go there and assist them. Before I send you off, though, you need to prove your skills to my satisfaction. I won't send you out just to become one more corpse on the pile. You need to show me you can grasp victory." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Head to the southwest of The Military Hall and report to Guard Captain Tatius. If you can take out the kinds of monsters that have been plaguing the mine, I'll approve your participation in our rescue operation there."#npc$$821$1#|
14492|#&7$Andre##br#
"Captain Tatius is currently overseeing the transport of an Armored Lion captured in the depths of the mines. If you can't handle this beast, don't even dream about working with our operation." #npc$$821$1#|
14493|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Andre that you took out the Armored Lion from the mines - and did it with style.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"I have to admit, for being new at this, you take to it quite readily. Even Templars would need a year or two of training before they'd be able to slay a beast like that alone."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Before you head to the mine, let me repeat: this is not practice; it's a real emergency, and if you're not careful, you could die. Even knowing that, are you still willing to accept this mission?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod your consent, saying that since you're stuck with your Eidolons at the moment, for better or worse, you figure you might as well use their power for something beneficial.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Good. I still don't have much faith in this whole 'Envoy of Gaia' business, but at least you've got the right attitude."#br##br#
#&53$The slightest hint of a satisfied smile plays across Andre's face.##npc$$824$1#|
14494|Andre posed a challenge: if you could defeat the Armored Lion brought in from the mines, you'd show you were strong enough to be useful in the Templars' rescue operation.

#&7$Andre##br#
"We're facing a very powerful enemy. As strong as I am, he's stronger still. It's possible that no one within the Templars is a match for him."#br##br#
#&53$Andre's words reveal mixed emotions.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"I'll send word on ahead to the squad leader that you'll be arriving to assist them. From this point, you're under my command, and you're my responsibility. You're working for the Church now, but outside the Templars' hierarchy." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Still, keep in mind that you're going as a representative of the Church. Don't do or say things that would sully the Church's reputation, got it?" #npc$$821$1#

And you have the uneasy feeling that, just as Andre said, the Shadow Knight is even stronger than what you saw in your dream.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"When we heard the news, we called an emergency council and formed an investigation team. But as far as we're currently aware, the Shadow Knight has abducted the few local residents."#npc$$821$1##&PP00601#

#&7$Andre##br#
"According to our report, the creatures in and around the mines have begun to mutate, and they're causing problems for our investigative team. Your mission - should you choose to accept it - is to support our team, and protect the local citizens. Priority goes to freeing any captives."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Andre that you'll do whatever it takes to help those who are in trouble, then turn to %p%.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
#&53$%p% says nothing, but its gaze gives you a sense that it's with you, whatever you decide.##pet$$823$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Very well. Now, head out for the Demarech Mines and meet up with Victoria, the leader of the investigation team. I'm... counting on you."#npc$$821$1#|
14532|#&7$Victoria##br#
"..."#npc$$1$1#|
14533|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You flash the Investigation Team Badge to Victoria, leader of the Templars' squad.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"You're %n%, right? Andre sent word on ahead about you coming. I'm surprised, though - wouldn't have expected he'd send someone so young. But at this point, I'll take all the help I can get."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain that you're an Envoy of Gaia, and that you're here to help with whatever is needed.##char$$807:0$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"They say that sometimes, beings from the outer realms lend portions of their spirit to those they deem worthy, and that the warriors they choose don't die and don't age, no matter how long they live. That's pretty wild, huh? Tell me, what does it feel like?"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"You probably know this by now, but... Andre seriously hates Envoys of Gaia. He disdains the very concept. And yet... here you are."#npc$$828$1#|
14534|Andre sent you to the Demarech Mines to assist the Templars in the rescue of Miles, a Church scholar who was captured by the Shadow Knight. Meet up with Victoria, leader of the Investigation Team, for an up-to-date briefing on the situation.

Go to the town of Tomitsa in the Demarech Mine area and meet up with Victoria.|
14541|#&7$Belenus##br#
"%n%, your report leaves no doubt that our foe is indeed the Shadow Knight - the strongest Envoy of Gaia to have trod this earth in our time. The black steed he rides is his Eidolon, Aschensturm."#npc$$821$1##&PP00102#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Just as when you met with the Shadow Knight in your dream, you could clearly see the gulf between your power and his.##char$$826:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Now, the Church's worst-case scenario has been realized: the Cube of Gaia has fallen into his hands. We must get it back, at all costs." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"The latest reports from Templar informants place the Shadow Knight as appearing in both the Triatio Highlands and Candeo Marsh. I pray you will continue to work with us throughout this trying time."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You say you're ready to help. The dream seems more now like a premonition of things to come, and you look forward to continuing to assist the investigation.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"%n%, you should talk with the two intelligence offers waiting in the Audience Chamber. The information they have may help you decide where to go and what to do next."#npc$$826$1#|
14542|#&7$Belenus##br#
"Speak with our intelligence agents from the Triatio Highlands and Candeo Marsh. They've been on the trail of the Shadow Knight, and know the obstacles we currently face on both fronts."#npc$$821$1#|
14543|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the Grand Bishop that the two intelligence officers brought you up to speed on the Shadow Knight's movements in the Triatio Highlands and Candeo Marsh. There were reports of paranormal phenomena, but these reports also give you a clue of where to start your search.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Just as you heard, after laying claim to the Cube of Gaia, the Shadow Knight absconded to the Triatio Highlands and the Candeo Marsh, but from there, his trail became murky."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Whether his intent is to expand his forces or something else entirely, we must reclaim the Cube of Gaia from him before he is able to tap too deeply into its power."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You wonder why the Shadow Knight chose to head to those two places, but right now you didn't have enough clues to make a guess.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"It seems that our shortcoming now is a lack of information. Might I suggest we investigate the matter further?"#br##br#
#&53$%p% looks at you expectantly.##pet$$821$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Where you go, I will follow."#pet$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Hearing %p%'s support, you nod in agreement, asking the Grand Bishop where to begin your investigation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"That, dear %n%, is up to you. You can head to the Triatio Highlands and ally with the hunters there to investigate the giant creatures there, or journey to Candeo Marsh, where a mysterious murder has left us with many questions and few answers."#br##br#
"When you're ready, just speak with the officers in charge." #npc$$822$1#|
14544|The Shadow Knight headed to the Triatio Highlands and the Candeo Marsh, with a series of mysterious occurrences in both locations. The Grand Bishop urged you to speak with the intelligence officers to learn more about what was happening.

Go to the audience chamber's north stairway and speak with Highland Intelligence Officer Darcy and Marsh Intelligence Officer Angus.|
14545|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inquire about the current situation in the Triatio Highlands.##char$$821$0# 

#&7$Darcy##br#
"Our most recent info placed the Shadow Knight in the Triatio Highlands for at least a short while, but we have no idea what he came there to do. What we do know is that, right around the time of his appearance, gigantic creatures appeared in the highlands."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Darcy##br#
"Soldiers have been dispatched from Navea to the highlands, of course, but the locals are being uncooperative. That's making it difficult to conduct a fruitful investigation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You find it surprising that the local citizens wouldn't want to aid the investigation.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Darcy##br#
"The highland's hunters and the giants who live there have a long, ongoing feud over the hunting grounds there. They fight their battles in their own way and don't seem to have any intention of listening to Church representatives."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Darcy##br#
"The hunters also seem to have become more intense in their offensive against the giants lately. We have to take careful stock of things before we think of intervening."#npc$$827$1#|
14546|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inquire about the current situation in the Candeo Marsh.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Angus##br#
"Several Templars are already stationed in the marsh, dispatched here to investigate at Anya's command."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Angus##br#
"We still don't know the Shadow Knight's true intentions, but our investigations have turned up several murders over the last few months, many committed under mysterious circumstances. The prime suspects are a fierce group known as the Corpser Bandits."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Angus##br#
"The Templars have rooted out the Corpser Bandits several times in the past, but like weeds, they tend to grow back. If the Shadow Knight came to Candeo Marsh to recruit the Corpsers to his cause, they could be a real thorn in our side."#npc$$828$1#|
14551|#&7$Darcy##br#
"Ready to head to the highlands, then? Our team currently stationed there is spearheaded by Squad Leader Robinson; you'll work with him on dealing with the issues that have cropped up in the Shadow Knight's wake."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Darcy##br#
"As per Robinson's report, the highland's hunters aren't keen on cooperating with us. As our team isn't familiar with the terrain or the local wildlife, it's not easy to gather information on these strange giant creatures that have appeared."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Darcy##br#
"You should meet with Robinson first; he'll be able to tell you the way you can best assist him. Currently, he and his team are stationed out of the Hunters' Mountain Village out in the Triatio Highlands."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Darcy##br#
"No need for a long journey, though; you can make a straight shot to the highlands via that teleporter nearby."#npc$$822$1#|
14552|#&7$Robinson##br# 
"Hmm..."#npc$$1$1#|
14553|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$When you run into Robinson, you see him arguing with someone. Though it seems like he's keeping his rage in check, his voice grows louder with every retort.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Robinson##br# 
"Look. I understand it isn't easy for you, but we ALL want to protect the village, right?"#br##br#
#&53$The man Robinson is arguing with seems to be Dallan, the village chief.##M125010$Robinson$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"That is correct, but I cannot agree with your soldiers' methods. Your ways are different from ours, and we don't have the time to take care of you."#M111030$Dallan$821$0#|
14554|You decided to head to the Triatio Highlands to search for clues to the Shadow Knight's whereabouts. The teleportation device behind Darcy will take you directly there.

Teleport to the Triatio Highlands and meet with Squad Leader Robinson there.|
14561|#&7$Angus##br#
"So, you decided to investigate the Candeo Marsh? Then let me give you a breakdown of the situation."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Angus##br#
"Recently, there's been a string of murders in Candeo Marsh - merchants, visiting on business, suffered horrific deaths under mysterious circumstances. Some say they were killed by vengeful ghosts, but the signs point to the Corpser Bandits."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You gulp, wondering which stalwart ally will help you stave off murderous assassins.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Angus##br#
"When you get to the Candeo Marsh, meet up with Anya, our Templar on the case. She's in charge of the ongoing investigation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You remember Anya - she showed you around Navea when you first arrived there. It puts your mind at ease that you'll be working with a familiar face.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Angus##br#
"The Templars need to focus on attacking the Corpser Bandits when they least expect it and can't effectively retaliate. They also need to investigate what the Shadow Knight was doing in the marsh, and why."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Angus##br#
"When you've made all the necessary preparations, you can fast-track yourself to Candeo Marsh by taking the teleporter near me."#npc$$821$1#|
14562|#&7$Anya##br#
"..."#npc$$1$1#|
14563|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Anya you've been dispatched to Candeo Marsh to support her team.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I heard they were sending someone to assist us, but I didn't know it was you until I saw your face here. You look a bit different from when we met in Crescent Hill - maybe a bit more seasoned."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're not sure how to reply to Anya's appraisal.##char$$809:0$0# 

#&7$Anya##br#
"Honestly, I've got mixed feelings, seeing you now. You've got an incredible power - I hope you always fight for the right causes."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Anyway, let me explain what's going on here."#npc$$821$1#|
14564|You decide to head to Candeo Marsh to investigate the murders and search for clues to the Shadow Knight's whereabouts. Head there quickly using the teleporter behind Angus.

Teleport to Candeo Marsh and meet with Templar Anya there.|
14571|#&7$Belenus##br#
"Right now, the Shadow Knight has discovered how to tap into the Cube of Gaia's powers. It seems now that all-out war against he and his forces is unavoidable."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're shocked to hear this, and wonder if the Grand Bishop knew more of the Shadow Knight's purpose than he let on.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"There are two reasons the Shadow Knight desires the Cube of Gaia. The first is, of course, the vast power of the cube - power enough to escape the chains of time."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You're not sure what the Grand Bishop is talking about, and ask him more about the 'chains of time'.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"%n%, let me just remind you that your line of inquiry crosses the boundaries of classified information, and we cannot answer you right now."#M135011$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"It's alright, Gus. Just explain it to %n% - seeing as we're relying on the Envoy's power, the Envoy deserves to know."#npc$$821$1#|
14572|#&7$Belenus##br#
"Gus will tell you about the Shadow Knight, and about the chains of time."#npc$$821$1#|
14573|#&7$Belenus##br#
"You may have suspected the Shadow Knight of being a demon, but I can assure you that he is indeed human - a human man named Reinhardt. Even before he came into contact with the Cube of Gaia, his equal in power and valor was not to be found in this land."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Before he took up the mantle of the Shadow Knight, Reinhardt worked tirelessly for the Church."#br##br#
#&53$The Grand Bishop pauses, gauging your reaction before continuing.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You urge him to continue, taking in these new revelations.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Reinhardt served us faithfully for many years here in this city as Commander of the Templars."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Suddenly, all the pieces seem to slot into place. Why some of the more seasoned Templars seemed to have more than a passing familiarity with the Shadow Knight. Why Alex  couldn't accept the Shadow Knight's actions. Why Andre bears a grudge against the Envoys of Gaia. It all makes sense now!##char$$828:0$0#|
14574|The Church seems to know much more about the Shadow Knight than it lets on, and the Grand Bishop has confirmed your suspicions, agreeing here and now to reveal everything to you.

Speak with Guard Officer Gus to learn the truth behind the Shadow Knight.|
14575|#&7$Gus##br#
"The legends the Church teaches are true - the three realms of Terra, Pandemonium, and the Aura Kingdom were born from the power of the Cube of Gaia. But unlike Pandemonium and the Aura Kingdom, our world, Terra, is subject to what we call the 'chains of time'."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Even supernatural beings are subject to the chains of time if they come to Terra - they'll grow, change, fade, then die with the march of years."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The Shadow Knight was consumed with laying hold of the Cube of Gaia because he believed that if anything could exert mastery over time, it would be the cube. And with the cube's power, an individual's time might even be reversible. If that is true, the departed could quite literally be brought back to life."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You mull the situation over. If the Shadow Knight's driving purpose is simply to bring someone who died back to life, then why do the Templars seem to be bracing themselves for all-out war?##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
#&53$Gus looks at the Grand Bishop, then back at you, sighing through his teeth.##br##br#
"That's because we know he has a second purpose: to take revenge on the Church."#npc$$828$1#|
14581|#&7$Belenus##br#
"Several years ago, Reinhardt's wife was taken ill by a strange disease. When he found out, he immediately stepped down from his duties and devoted his full energies to finding a cure. However, magic and modern science offered no cure."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"We gathered the greatest scholars and doctors, skilled in the practice of medicine and healing magics. Miles, whom Reinhardt abducted in the Demarech Mine incident, was a member of that team."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"However, in spite of their tireless work and herculean efforts, they could not cure Reinhardt's wife, and her life ebbed slowly, until her soul was finally at rest."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Reinhardt couldn't - wouldn't - accept that, after all the good he had done for the world, the woman who meant more to him than anything was taken from him. His sorrow gave birth to a seething anger, and it twisted him into a different person. He took his wife's body to the Silent Ice Field and entombed her somewhere in its frozen expanse, vowing to bring her back one day."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Reinhardt was convinced that the blame for his wife's passing fell fully in the hands of the Church, and he swore that he would take his revenge one day."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The weight of what you've just learned is so heavy, you're not sure what to think. You reassess the motives of Reinhardt, the Shadow Knight, but suddenly, you sense a strange pressure...##char$$809:0$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Watch out!"#M135011$Gus$1001$1#|
14582|#&7$Belenus##br#
"%n%, are you alright?"#br##br#
"Is anyone injured? Andre? How's Andre?" #npc$$828$1#|
14583|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask if the Grand Bishop is okay, praying that he wasn't harmed.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"You needn't worry about an old man like me; how are the others?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"It seems we've reached this point now. %n%, I want you to understand that the tragedy Reinhardt suffered was very real, and the fact that we could do nothing for him was truly tragic. But we had our reasons for making the choices that we did."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"That said... If he continues to harm innocents - to take his anger out on those who have nothing to do with him - then we shall do whatever it takes to stop him."#npc$$821$1#|
14584|You felt a powerful pressure in the audience chamber. Without warning, the Shadow Knight appeared and every soldier there rushed to the defense of the Grand Bishop.

Defeat the monsters summoned into the audience chamber and protect the Grand Bishop.|
14585|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You lean in to tend to Andre's injuries.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Thank the Goddess... you were here to defend the Grand Bishop."#br##br#
#&53$Andre grits his teeth, an exhausted, sunken look on his face.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"You must stop him, %n%. Not to wash away the stain on the Templars' honor, and not because of our past trust in him..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"I've known him for years; his dedication to his cause has always been unflappable. So when he says this world deserves to burn, I believe he can make it happen. That's the kind of person Reinhardt is."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Well... Don't just stand there like you've grown roots. Check on the Grand Bishop!"#npc$$821$1#|
14591|#&7$Belenus##br#
"No doubt you've seen it before, as you did now: Reinhardt has found a way to use the Cube of Gaia to open a direct link to the plane of Pandemonium. The demon you fought was from that woeful realm."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"If his words are true, a battle against the demons is unavoidable. The world will face the greatest crisis of this age, and we cannot stand idly by."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You asked the Grand Bishop what he thinks should be done, and what you should do to stop the Shadow Knight, pledging to stand by he and the Templars in this trying time.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Our military power will not be enough to stand against the demons from Pandemonium. We need to stand unified with the many races, tribes, and regions of Terra."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I would recommend asking other tribes for assistance, and opening the possibility for an alliance. Aside from that, Navea is always in need of engineers skilled in the manufacture and repair of machines."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell the Grand Bishop about Augustus from Cactakara Forest, who recreated the ancient Halo Energy technology through his experimentation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I'll send a messenger to contact him in Cactakara Forest, then. If we all step forward and give of our talents, our odds against the Shadow Knight's forces will be greatly improved. Messengers from other tribes are starting to arrive in Navea - I want you to speak with them." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"We'll need the help of the brave Makar of Ventos Prairie, as well as the financial and logistical savvy of the Sanknie Alliance, a powerful trade group."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"If we are to do battle with the demons, our stronghold in the Oblitus Wood, Nudak Fortress, must fortify itself for battle."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, recalling fragments from your prophetic dream. The situation - and your feelings on it - have become very complicated.##char$$806:0$0##&V0007#

#&7$%n%##br#
"If it's a battle they want, we'll be ready for them."#char$$1$0#|
14592|#&7$Glenn##br#
"Don't be naive! The Makar? Their arrogance blinds them to the value of anything besides raw strength. And the Sanknie Alliance? The only god they believe in is profit!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Glenn##br#
"Go and ask them, then. I'd like to see how well you fare."#npc$$821$1#|
14593|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You told Glenn what the Grand Bishop had told you: that Nudak Fortress, in the Oblitus Wood, would be the first line of defense against the Shadow Knight's forces.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Glenn##br#
"So, things have gone this far, have they? No wonder Navea's been cramming warehouses full of supplies lately. Looks like I'd better start getting those supplies to the battlefront soon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Glenn##br#
"We're in a bit of a spot at the moment, really. Our soldiers in Nudak Fortress stand strong and united against the enemy, but recent troubles in the woods have made it difficult for them to completely perform their duties." #npc$$828$1#|
14594|It became clear that to stand against the demonic forces, the people of Terra must band together. What you need to do now is to seek out other tribes and factions and convince them to join in the fight against the Shadow Knight.

#&53$The woman before you, Cecile, is the representative of the Makar, recently arrived from Ventos Prairie. You introduce yourself and tell her why you've come.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Cecile##br#
"Heh. You come asking our aid... Do you really think you know us so well?"#br##br#
#&53$Cecile turns her head, staring intently at you from the corners of her eyes.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Cecile##br#
"We value strength; we laud honor. This city with its high towers and meticulous craftsmanship has beauty, but no strength behind it. What makes you think we would want to ally with you?"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ponder what you can do to convince her of your alliance's strength.##char$$809:80$0#|

#&53$You introduce yourself to Seagram, the representative of the Sanknie Alliance, and tell him why you've come.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"Hah! Well, at least you know how to follow the money  - the Sanknie Alliance is known all across the Watt continent for the wealth we've raked in."#br##br#
#&53$Seagram laughs, as though he finds your earnest petition some kind of joke.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"We've managed to accumulate wealth because we've made it an important part of our lives. We work hard to get the money we have. Why would we want to just give out our gold and jewels?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"Even with all our lucre, the Alliance's branch in the Star Sand Desert manages to spend every coin they get their hands on. So tell me, how does the Sanknie Alliance stand to benefit from adding our resources to this venture?"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You shrug, telling Seagram that if no one stops the march of the Shadow Knight and his demonic army, the world will fall into chaos.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"You say that, but I've seen no sign of it yet. The Shadow Knight may be powerful, but he's just one man, and one man can't take down an army."#br##br#
#&53$Seagram laughs, seeming quite sure of himself.##npc$$826$1#|
14601|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You continue trying to persuade Cecile, but the harder you try, the more intently she seems to ignore you.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Cecile##br#
"Would you cease your petulant behavior? Have you ever even been around the Makar? If you really knew us, you'd realize how foolish you sound right now. No Makar would spill their blood for a frail human cause."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You don't really know how to respond. It's true, you explain - your main contact with the Makar was meeting Odum in the Alabastren Temple.##char$$828:80$0#

#&7$Cecile##br#
"There's an election soon to occur, to choose our new leader, and things are really starting to heat up. Personally, I think you'll get laughed out of the court, but if that happens, look for a warrior named Shalen and tell her what you told me about your meeting with Odum Ryan." #npc$$821$1#|

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You weren't quite expecting to be shut down right out of the gate, so you try re-stating your intent to speak to the Makar leader. Not knowing what else to say, you tell the guard you're acquainted with the third prince, Odum.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Leo's Bodyguard##br#

#&7$Glenn##br#
"Truth be told, there's been a lot of trouble in the Oblitus Wood recently, and not anything with a simple solution. The forest used to be beautiful and green, but recent years have seen almost a draining away of color from the environment."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Glenn##br#
"Not too long ago, we even heard word that the neighboring village had been occupied. It may not be my place to say, but I think the soldiers of Nudak Fortress are feeling pretty demoralized right now."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Glenn that the fortress is likely to face a large battle against demons soon, and that depression isn't likely to help their chances.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Glenn##br#
"I know that! But... You're the one the Church has such high regard for. Maybe if you were to visit the Oblitus Wood and encourage the soldiers, you could raise their morale."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, deciding that it's worthwhile to visit the Oblitus Wood see the kind of problems Nudak Fortress is facing for yourself.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Glenn##br#
"Analisa seems to have been headed to the Oblitus Wood, too. When she came through here, she was packing a couple of military-grade electromagnetic cannons from the Church's armory, so I'm wondering what she has in mind."#npc$$821$1#|

"...." #npc$$821$1$1#|

#&53$You stand before Carrick, Nudak Fortress's commander, and explain why you've come, telling him that this fortress will likely be a key stronghold against the Shadow Knight's forces.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I understand. We have always served through valor in combat."#br##br#
#&53$Carrick's words are strong, but he seems impatient, even a bit pained.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Look around you. You see the kind of environment we're living in. It's easy for the Church to analyze the situation from their posh posts in Navea, but how much can they really know about what we need? And what do we get? Some girl smith with a wagonload of cannons and an inexperienced %s%."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$Seagram eyes you suspiciously.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, although you're not sure what's going through Seagram's mind. You're still thinking how you might convince the Sanknie Alliance to lend their support to the Church.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Seagram##br#
#&53$Seagram begins to laugh, seeing you thinking so hard.##br##br#
"I owe you my thanks, %n%, though it seems you might not know the whole story."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"Just a few months ago, I made a large deposit of some expensive jewelry in the bank in Navea. But one of the collection's prize pieces, a certain ruby necklace, was stolen while the bank was transporting it to a higher-security vault."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"I recognized your name because Thorne told me who recovered my necklace from the thief."#br##br#
#&53$Seagram nods, smiling.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You recall how, when you first came to Navea, you helped Thorne the banker recover a certain necklace from Fleet Footed Andy the thief. You never suspected you'd meet its owner, especially not like this.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"I can vouch for you, but the decision as to whether the Sanknie Alliance will throw its financial support behind this coalition you're putting together isn't up to me. The man you'll need to talk to is Hayes, out in the Star Sand Desert. He's one of the Alliance's project directors."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"At the moment, Hayes is in a bit of a bind with one of his big projects. If you can help him out, there's a strong chance he'd return the favor."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Seagram##br#
"The real challenge, %n%, is that you must first earn Hayes' trust. The rich have many would-be 'friends', and successful merchants tend to harbor healthy amounts of doubt about all kinds of people."#npc$$826$1#|

"Hey, what are you doing wandering around here?"#npc$$821$1#|
14623|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You introduce yourself, and tell Hayes the reason you've come.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"I wouldn't expect you to know this, but even our division based out of Palmgil Oasis is currently in a financial pinch. In fact, the way things are going now, we could have our line of financing cut at any time."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"If I don't even have the money to cover my own expenses, how does the Church expect me to help them? I'm not a golden goose."#br##br#
#&53$Hayes' flustered look couldn't be clearer.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"If it's part-time work you're looking for, though, that's a different story. Pay a visit to Ben, our division's guard captain. We're always in need of more people - mercenaries especially."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Hayes seems to be stressed out by his circumstances. All you can do, at this point, is follow Seagram's advice. Maybe taking a job with the Alliance's crew at the oasis will build their trust in you.##char$$828:0$0#|
14624|Seagram said that if you want to gain the support of the Sanknie Alliance, you should go to the Star Sand Desert and meet Hayes, who's in charge of a large operation there. Finding him will be easy; earning his trust will be the hard part.

"And that engineer you recommended before - Augustus, I believe? You'll need to head to Cactakara Forest to notify him. Tell them to begin enacting the plan we discussed previously."#M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

#&7$Soren##br#
"There is a sort of mystique to Secret Stones that's amazing; they can heighten the strengths of a person's body. If you're looking for a good way to surpass your own abilities, having secret stones on you is a great idea!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#

#&53$You ask Analisa why she would suddenly need a Eidolon accessory since the Templars do not have Eidolons of their own.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Well, it is still in an experimental phase, but... I'm researching what types of accessories would increase an Eidolon's potential to their maximum capabilities. If we can find out which types are best, we'll be able to focus on only certain ones and greatly improve them."#M142010$Analisa$1$1#

 "The entire forest has been contaminated by Soporific Spores.#br#
The defensive spell I just told you about only covers Mushroom Village; #br#
 if you want to venture to other places, additional protection is essential."#npc$$821$1#

 and how to resist the effects of the Soporific Spores#br#
 once you leave Mushroom Village.#char$$821$0#

#&7$ Caresha##br#
 "Drink this first, and then we'll talk."#br#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "This potion will make you immune to the Soporific Spores;#br#

%p%You ask while looking at the empty potion bottle.#pet$$821$0#

 "There is a giant mushroom in the middle of Mushroom Forest. The locals call it Titan's Grove."#br#
Caresha points to the distant forest.#br#
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br##br#
 You look towards the forest #br#
and although you are unable to see anything, you can sense a peculiar energy in the air.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Apart from being a well-known landmark, the locals believe it has divine power. #br#
Perhaps because of this, Mushroom Forest is a place where magic is researched."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Caresha##br#
 "Titan's Grove has recently been infected,#br#
 and the outbreak is spreading. Many plants and animals are likely infected and spreading Soporific Spores, just like in Titan's Grove."#br#
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Caresha##br#
 "The mushrooms outside of the village have also been contaminated;#br#
 these mushrooms are not far away and I fear that the Soporific Spores will reach the village.#br#

 "Who'd have thought a quiet and peaceful place like Mushroom Forest could become the way it is now?"#br#
 Caresha lets out a deep sigh.#br#

 You ask about Mushroom Forest's past. #&7$%n%##br#
#br#
Caresha's expression reveals her fond feelings for the place.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Mushroom Forest is a source of holy power,#br#
and many magicians have carried out research there #br#
to reveal its secrets."#npc$$821$1#

Caresha#&7$##br# "Many new magical discoveries were made 
#br#as a result of their free and open exchange of ideas.
#br#At the time, the forest was thought of as the magicians' magical temple."

they were unable to withstand the demonic onslaught."#br#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "There was a constant stream of injured soldiers being sent back; the mages defending the village#br#
#br# had to cast magic spells#br#

 "The medical corps is responsible for treating physical injuries." #br#
Seeing you glancing around, Caresha starts to speak.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "But normal medical workers are not enough#br#
 to look after those who have been entranced; #br#
they need to be cared for by mages."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "That is the reason I have led the mages here." #br#
#npc$$826$1#

#&7$ Caresha##br#
 "Unfortunately, during the fierce battle with the demons,#br#
 some of the vanguard soldiers became entranced, #br#
as did their comrades."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "The soldiers don't know how to remove the entrancement effect.#br#
 They just need to be subdued#br#
 and sent back to the village with the other victims."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

 that were entranced.#br#

#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Luckily, we have found a way to suppress the effects of the entrancement.#br# We can also apply a spell to those affected 
#br#so that they only temporarily lose consciousness." 
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You listen and ponder this.#br#
 Given the present circumstances,#br#
 this really is the best way to resolve things.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "The effect of the magic has a time limit,#br#
 so we need mages to look after the injured#br#
 and re-apply the healing magic at necessary intervals #br#
 to continually suppress the entrancement."#npc$$821$1#

 You ask Caresha if there is anything you can do to help.#char$$1$0#

#&7$ Caresha##br#
 "Near the village, there is a plant known as Energy Grass.#br#
 It can help by enhancing the effectiveness of the healing magic."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Please hurry and collect Energy Grass.#br#
We are already low on manpower,#br#
so it would be great if you could help."#npc$$821$1#|
14762|#&7$Caresha##br#
 "If there if too many people aren't actively under a healing spell#br#
 and it's too late to reapply one, we'll have a very dangerous situation on our hands."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Refining the Energy Grass in a Hookah#br#
 will extend the healing spell's efficacy and#br#
 take some of the pressure off of the mages."#npc$$821$1#|

14771|#&7$%n%##br#
 You remember that Mushroom Forest is occupied by the Charm Queen#br#
 and ask Caresha whether the Soporific Spores#br#
are her doing.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Yes, the Charm Queen is behind the corruption of Titan's Grove; these spores that have the power to entrance are magical rather than poisonous." #br#
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "We've nothing to fear if we have the antidote.#br#
 Unfortunately, it can only be taken as a preventative measure, as you have done.#br#
 Another approach is needed in order to cure those who are already infected."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "We know of a way to counter the magic,#br#
 but we've encountered some difficulties..."#npc$$1$1#

 You inquire further into the details.#char$$821$0##&PP01201#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "As well as getting hold of a specimen, #br#
 we also need something called a 'Magic Extractor'#br#
 to analyze, separate and add other materials while casting a spell. #br#
Only then can we extract the purified spore cores and refine them into a magic potion."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$##br#
 Magic Extractor?#br#
 According to Caresha, there isn't such an instrument within Mushroom Village.#br#
 You ask Caresha whether you need to return to Navea.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "There are few occasions where a special instrument like a Magic Extractor would be used, and unfortunately there are none to be found in Navea.#br#
 There certainly aren't any in a small place like Mushroom Village."#br#
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#

 You hand the Soft Fox Fur you have collected to Walter.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "Wonderful, %n%!#br#
 I never expected you would get so many.#br# There should be enough here to make several coats."
#br# Walter says while counting the furs.
#npc$$821$1#|
14784|To help the wounded survive the cold night, Walter asks you to help prepare Soft Fox Fur to make into warm overcoats. 

Drive out the Bat-Eared Foxes north of Mushroom Village and collect Soft Fox Fur.|
14791|#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Walter about the situation at the front line.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "I've been away from the front line for a while, but at back then, the situation was desperate.#br#
 I just know that there are many more wounded that will arrive in Mushroom Village, including the Makar royals." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "The latest news#br#
 from the medics#br#
 is really causing some concern." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "The foxes in the northwest are giving us a trouble during battle,#br#
 which is a whole new challenge."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "I've heard the medics say #br#
that these vicous foxes are attacking people#br#
 as they transport supplies to the front line or move the wounded."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "In the village there are only the mages - who already have their hands full - and the wounded.#br#
 We have no reserve fighting forces.#br#
 Those damn foxes are sure to get into the village; #br#
 maybe I should go and teach them a lesson!#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You quickly stop Walter in his tracks,#br#
 suggesting that he stay and rest#br#
 and telling him that you can help deal with the foxes in the north.#char$$1$0#

#&7$ Walter##br#
 "My wound could open up again like last time; I guess I should remain here.#br#
 In that case, I'll leave it to you to drive out the foxes."#br#
#npc$$821$1#|
14792|#&7$Walter##br#
 "I'd dearly love to go out and teach those foxes a lesson."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "It's driving me mad having to#br#
 wait here and rest."#npc$$821$1#|
14793|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Walter you have dealt with the Forest Foxes to the north of the village. #char$$1$0#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "%n%, you're getting more and more impressive!#br#
 When I first met you at Triatio Highlands,#br#
 I remember wishing I could be like you someday."#br#
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You humbly tell Walter that you simply did what needed to be done.#char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Walter about Hermione, another vanguard soldier you recall meeting at the time. #br#
 #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "Hermione helps out here as well,#br#
 but she still hasn't returned #br#
 from her mission to hold talks with Fel Town."#br#
 Walter has a worried expression on his face.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "Caresha will also tell you that#br#
 a Magic Extractor is needed to remove the entrancing magic;#br#
 such a specialized instrument cannot be found in Mushroom Village and needs to be transported here from Fel Town."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Fel Town is a located in Mushroom Forest,#br#
 but Caresha made no mention of there being a Magic Extractor there.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "That's because there has been no word#br#
 from the envoys we dispatched, including Hermione.#br#
 We've sent out more people to investigate, but so far we've received no news back."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "It's probably nothing, #br#
 but it's possible that Fel Town has been attacked by demons;#br#
 and we can't say for sure that the warlocks haven't already been killed."#npc$$1$1#|
14794|Walter asks you to drive out the fierce foxes in the north to prevent them getting in to the village.

 Drive out the Forest Foxes to the north of Mushroom Village.|
14801|#&7$Walter##br#
 "If we don't get hold of the Magic Extractor soon,#br#
 the number of wounded will increase faster then we can treat them.#br#
 I'm also concerned for Hermione's safety."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Walter##br#
 "%n%, can you please help by asking Caresha#br#
 about the situation in Fel Town?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$ Walter##br#
 "I heard that people had been sent to investigate;#br#
 how can there not be any new leads?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod your head. Caresha had mentioned the Magic Extractor,#br#
 but hadn't said anything about Fel Town.#br#
 This worries you - if there is no news from Fel Town,#br#
 then a Magic Extractor will need to be transported from somewhere else.#char$$806:0$0#|
14802|#&7$Caresha##br#
 "I hope things aren't as bad as I fear."#br#
 Caresha seems worried.#npc$$821$1#|
14803|#&7$%n%##br#
You pass on Walter's questions and concerns to Caresha #br#
and tell her what you think.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Your assumption is correct.#br#
 The envoys we dispatched have not returned,#br#
 and now we are forced to wait for an Extractor to be sent from elsewhere."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "We have also lost contact#br#
 with the investigators we sent to find the envoys.#br#
 I fear something terrible has happened in Fel Town."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "If we can't secure the instrument from Fel Town#br#
 and one needs to be sent from somewhere else,#br#
 it'll cost us several days."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "In any case, until we get the Magic Extractor, #br#
 we need to strengthen the defenses of Mushroom Village."#br#
#npc$$821$1#|
14804|Walter is concerned about the entranced soldiers and the investigators sent to Fel Town. He requests that you ask Caresha about the Magic Extractor situation once again.

 Talk with Caresha.|
14811|#&7$Caresha##br#
 "We've detected a mysterious power#br#
 that is affecting the village's defensive magic. #br#
We don't know the source of the power, #br#
but we cannot allow it to continue interfering."#npc$$821$1#

Caresha##br#
 "To prevent the village from being exposed,#br#
 we need to find out who is doing this and why."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Right now, we're fighting an invisible enemy; investigating will be risky. #br#
%n%I think that with your strength, #br#
you can help us locate the source of this power."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Caresha you are willing to help,#br#
 but that you don't know where to start.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Don't worry, I'll find some helpers for you!#br#
 Caresha finds a nearby cage. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You have no idea what Caresha proposes to do.#br#
#char$$823:0$0#

#&7$ Caresha##br#
 "These Soulless Snails are native to the Mushroom Forest and are extremely sensitive to magic in the air. They like to gather in magical places; I think they can help you with the investigation."#br#
#br#
#npc$$821$1#|
14812|#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Even though the snails move slowly, you'll lose them if you're not careful."#npc$$821$1#|
14813|#&7$%n%##br#
You hand the strange rune you got from the sprout to Caresha#br#
 and tell her what you saw.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "This is the rune used by the warlocks in Fel Town!#br#
 I can't believe they would do something like this."#br#
 Caresha looks flabbergasted.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Applying a rune to the body of an animal#br#
 not only controls the animal, but also masks the identity of the caster; we won't be able to locate the source of the interference."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Fel Town may have already betrayed us."#br#
 Caresha's expression becomes even more serious.#npc$$1$1#|
14814|A myterious power is interfering with the village's defensive magic. Caresha asks you to find the source of the interference.

 At the entrance to the village, you release the Soulless Snail and defeat the Seal Sprout to get the Mysterious Runes.|
14821|#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Contact has been lost with the messengers and investigators sent to Fel Town;#br#
 it looks like they may have met with misfortune."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "After the envoys had lost contact,#br#
 I sent Squad Leader Robinson to look for them,#br#
 but now there is no word from him, either."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "%n%, the situation is critical. #br#
 Please hurry and find Robinson and the other envoys."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 If Fel Town's Warlocks have indeed betrayed us,#br#
 you will no doubt tirgger Fel Town's defenses on your way there."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
 "Those Warlocks control a Mushroom Giant who will regard you as an intruder.#br#
 Be on your guard in case you are ambushed."#npc$$821$1#|
14822|#&7$Elmo##br#
 "Careful now! Keep an eye out to make sure no one's coming up behind you,"#br#
 Elmo warns the others.#npc$$1001$1#|
14823|#&7$Elmo##br# "Halt! Who goes there?" 
#br#Elmo confronts you, ready to fight.
#npc$$1001$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The soldier's battle scars demonstrate his combat experience.#br#
 You introduce yourself to the soldier and state your purpose for being there.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "So, it's you; %n%! #br#
Forgive me, I thought you were the enemy."#br#
 Elmo breathes a sigh of relief and relaxes his combat posture.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "I just saw how you defeated those Mushroom Giant - very impressive!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You see that it's not only Elmo who is wounded here. #br#
You ask Elmo who he is and how the other soldiers were injured. #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "We are the envoys that were ordered to go to Fel Town.#br#
 Before you arrived, we had just escaped from the clutches of the Warlocks there." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "The warlocks have betrayed us,#br#
 seeking favor with the demons and pledging allegiance to the despotic Charm Queen!"#br#
Elmo is clearly very agitated.#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "The warlocks imprisoned us in the town#br#
 to prevent us from reporting back."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "We wanted to escape at any cost,#br#
 and Robinson helped us to get away while their defenses were down."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "I had no idea we would find such powerful Mushroom Giants all along the journey back to the village.#br#
 Thanks to your handy work, #br#
we shouldn't have too much more trouble on our way."#npc$$821$1#|
14824|Fel Town has most likely broken their alliance. Go to Fel Town to find the envoys and investigators who have failed to return. Caresha asks that you meet up with Robinson, as he may have useful information.

 Try to find the investigators and Squad Leader Robinson.|
14831|#&7$%n%##br#

14832|#&7$Elmo##br#
 "How are you holding up?#br#

 Concerned, Elmo asks after the others.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "Wait until we've done away with the Mushroom Giants behind us;#br#

14833|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Elmo you've cleared the Mushroom Giants that were giving chase.#char$$821$0#

#&7$ Elmo##br#
 "Now we can hurry back to the village#br#

 You ask Elmo once again if #br#
 there is any news of Robinson.#char$$821$0#

#&7$ Elmo##br#
 "While fighting our way out of Fel Town, Squad Leader Robinson told us to push on#br#
 while he covered us from the rear. He said he'd bring Hermione back with him#br#
 after he had defeated the Warlocks."#br#
 Elmo looks worried.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "Hermione was determined to bring back the Magic Extractor;#br#
 I can't blame her for trying,#br#
 but I'm worried that she's dicing with death by remaining there."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "Anyway, we need to get the news of Fel Town's betrayal back to the village.#npc$$821$1#|
14834|To stop the Mushroom Giantstalkers from following you all the way back to the village, Elmo asks that you get rid of them.

 Defeat the Mushroom Giantstalkers pursuing you.|
14841|#&7$%n%##br#
Robinson and Hermione have both remained in Fel Town,#br#
 and their situation is desperate.#br#
 You tell Elmo that you plan to go to their aid at once.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Elmo##br#
 "Good. We'll head back to the village#br#
 and give them the news about Fel Town;#br#
 I entrust the safety of Squad Leader Robinson and Hermione to you."#npc$$821$1#

14842|#&7$Robinson ##br#
"Phew..."#br#
 gasps Robinson.#npc$$1001$1#|
14843|#&7$%n%##br#

 Robinson is there, standing over them.#char$$1$0#

#&7$ Robinson##br#
 "Aren't you %n%?#br#
 It's great that you've come to help us."#br#
 Looking like he has been in many battles, Robinson wipes the beads of sweat from his brow.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You tell Robinson you are as glad to see him#br#
 as when he led the Navea infantry into battle at Triatio Highlands.#br#
 You then inform him about your encounter with Elmo.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Robinson##br#
 "So, I guess you had a rough idea of the situation here #br#
before you arrived.#br#
 Thanks to you, Elmo and the others should make it safely back to the village."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask Robinson where Hermione is.#char$$1$0#

 I still haven't her;#br#
 she must still be somewhere in Fel Town."#npc$$828$1#|
14844|Elmo returns to Mushroom Village to deliver the news about Fel Town's allegiance to the demons. You hurry to Fel Town to help Squad Leader Robinson.

#&7$ ##br#
 "Afterwards, I tried to find her in the village,#br#
 but as you saw for yourself,#br#
 most of the warlocks in the village have pledged their allegiance to the demons,#br#
 which made the search more than a little difficult."#npc$$821$1#

 "Great! Let's split up then.#br#
 I'll go and look for Hermione and keep an eye out for the Magic Extractor.#br#

#&7$Robinson##br#
 "There's one more thing you can do for me.#br#
 The Mayor of Fel Town is an old friend of mine.#br#
 He's helped me out a lot in the past."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
 "I find it hard to believe he would sell us out to the Charm Queen...#br#
 If you see him while you're eliminating the Demon Apprentices,#br#
 bring him with you so I can see for myself if I'm right."#npc$$821$1#|
14852|#&7$Robinson##br#
 "Where could Hermione have run off to?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$ Robinson##br#
 "I understand she wants to rescue her comrades,#br#

so they and Alex#br#
have taken a few elite troops to fight the Charm Queen."#M038020$Shalen$821$1#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"Even though they were able to defeat the Charm Queen's army, she managed to escape. #br#
The two princes made a quick decision to pursue her, and have left the wounded and a few others to guard the area."#M038020$Shalen$1$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"I originally wanted to go with Odum, #br#
but he asked me to stay behind and take command of the soldiers here. #br#
We are now cleaning out the contaminated Titan's Grove."#M038050$Tatiana$821$1#|
14984|The soldier who wants to speak to you is Ike. After waking up, he tells you he wants to head to the frontlines to join the fight, but you ask him to stay in Mushroom Village and tend to his wounds. You will go to Titan's Grove on your own, and meet with Tatiana.

Go to Titan's Grove and seek out Tatiana.|
14991|#&7$Tatiana##br#
"The work of purifying Titan's Grove has already begun, #br#
but it's not complete, and contaminants are still polluting the air."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"The mushroom creatures near here keep falling under an evil spell.#br#
I need help getting rid of these creatures#br#
to prevent the enchantment from spreading."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"If this contamination reaches the frontlines, I'm afraid the consequences would be disastrous."#br#
Tatiana looks off into the distance with a worried expression. #npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You agree with what Tatiana says, #br#
but if Titan's Grove is the source of the contamination, #br#
it's even more critical to guard and purify it. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Tatiana that you will take care of eliminating the Contaminated Mushrooms,#br#
and that she can take a crew to Titan's Grove and eliminate the source of the enchantment.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"No problem - that's what Odum wants, too. #br#
Our people will defend Titan's Grove to the death. #br#
We'll leave it up to you to eliminate the contaminated creatures."#npc$$821$1#|
14992|#&7$Tatiana##br#
"I said I'm fine! Don't look so worried."#br#
Tatiana shoos away the nearby Medic and guards.#npc$$821$1#|
14993|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Tatiana that you have cleared the immediate area of Contaminated Mushrooms and Fluorescent Mushrooms,#br#
and she needn't worry about the contamination spreading for now.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"Mushroom Forest lies upwind from here. #br#
If this forest falls to our enemies,#br#
the Soporific Spores will spread all over."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"Each day Titan's Grove is not purified means another day that my army cannot achieve victory. #br#
Right now all we can do is deal with the contamination nearby, and prevent it from spreading further."#npc$$1$1#|
14994|The contamination continues to spread as long as Titan's Grove remains unpurified. To keep the entrancing magic from spreading as well, Tatiana wants you to eliminate all of the Contaminated Mushrooms nearby. 

Clear out all the Contaminated Mushrooms and Fluorescent Mushrooms.|
15001|#&7$Tatiana##br#
"I need to see if there's another way to speed up the purification process."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"If you need any more information, #br#
talk to the soldiers and mages around here. Perhaps you'll learn something."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"Do me a favor while you're at it, and deliver these rations to them."#npc$$821$1#|
15002|#&7$Tatiana##br#
Tatiana seems to be lost in concentration.#br#
It takes a moment for her to notice you.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"I'm sorry, I guess I'm too focused.#br#
Did you distribute all the rations?"#npc$$1$1#|
15003|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Tatiana that all the rations have been delivered.#br#
You then ask about speeding up the purification of Titan's Grove,#br#
and whether there are any other possible methods.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"No... no matter what other method I think of, #br#
it's still slower than having numerous people cast purification spells."#br#
Tatiana shakes her head and lets out a deep sigh.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"How are things with you? #br#
Did you find out what you wanted to know?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell her what others have told you about the battle,#br#
particularly the talk of Tatiana's injuries and the retreat of the Charm Queen.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"My injuries are minor.#br#
I am Tatiana of the Makar and fiancee of Odum."#br#
Tatiana raises her chin and takes on a noble arrogance.#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"But the Charm Queen was defeated and has fled.#br#
That's very surprising..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"That must mean that Odum and the Second Prince have joined forces.#br#
That's the only way a high-level demon like the Charm Queen could have been defeated."#npc$$825$1#|
15004|Tatiana is racking her brain about how to speed up the purification process. If you need to, you can ask the wounded soldiers for information and deliver their rations while you're at it.

Distribute the rations to the wounded soldiers and mages, and talk to them while you're there.|
15005|#&7$%n%##br#
You deliver the rations to the Wounded Stone Guard#br#
and ask about the earlier battle with the demons.#char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Wounded Stone Guard##br#
"You're %n%, right?#br#
So you've come to help, too."#br#
The Stone Guard reaches out to take the rations.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wounded Stone Guard##br#
"It's a pity that you're too late.#br#
You missed the heroic feats of the Second and Third Princes#br#
and the pitiful sight of the Charm Queen running away!"#br#
The Wounded Stone Guard relishes the memory.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask if Alex, who was at the frontlines, #br#
also took part in the battle.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Wounded Stone Guard##br#
"Alex? I think he also helped...#br#
But, of course, the two princes deserve most of the credit!"#npc$$1$1#|
15006|#&7$%n%##br#
You give the rations to the Makar Sorcerer.#br#
The magic needed to purify Titan's Grove requires continual casting,#br#
and all the Sorcerers can do is take advantage of the rotation to grab a bite to eat.#char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Makar Sorcerer##br#
"%n%?#br#
Ever since you defeated the two princes in the Leyline Arena, #br#
everyone in the tribe knows your name."#br#
The sorcerer takes the rations from you.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask about the demon battle that occurred here previously. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Makar Sorcerer##br#
"Actually, in the midst of the fray, Madame Tatiana was injured as well.#br#
I think that's why the Third Prince wanted her to stay here."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Makar Sorcerer##br#
"Even though it often seems the Third Prince is indifferent to Madame Tatiana, #br#
I think deep down he must really care about her."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Makar Sorcerer##br#
"I'm very surprised the Third Prince is wearing human armor.#br#
It actually suits him quite well. #br#
Oh... don't tell anyone that I said that!"#npc$$821$1#|
15011|#&7$Tatiana##br#
"I always assume the Charm Queen might be conducting some sinister plot, #br#
so I'm still worried about the team that went in pursuit of her.#br#
However, someone has to keep control of this area..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"There shouldn't be any more new threats to Titan's Grove for now. We just have our purification work...#br#
but orders are orders. I must obey Odum's orders#br#
and stay here until the task is finished."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"%n%,#br#
you are the best candidate.#br#
I ask that you go to the frontlines and support Odum in my place. #br#
With your strength, I think you'll be able to overcome any obstacle."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod to Tatiana to show your willingness to provide support.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"Shalen will tell you the relevant details and take you to the frontlines."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"%n%,#br#
the opponent is the Charm Queen, one of the Shadow Knight's four minions. Please watch your step.#br#
The honor of the Makar will be with you!"#npc$$822$1#|
15012|#&7$Shalen##br#
"Another opportunity to defeat the Charm Queen has come. #br#
The Second and Third Princes will certainly emerge victorious."#npc$$821$1#|
15013|#&7$Shalen##br#
"We've received word from our scouts that#br#
Alex and the two princes are in pursuit of the Charm Queen.#br#
It seems she has escaped into the Haunted Passage."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"They are currently mustering their troops at the entrance to the Haunted Passage,#br#
and are preparing for another showdown with the Charm Queen."#npc$$1$1#|
15014|Tatiana is very worried about the situation at the frontlines, and has asked you to go there and support Odum and the others. She, in turn, will stay at Titan's Grove to complete the purification work. Shalen will take you to the battlefield.

Ask Shalen about the upcoming battle.|
15021|#&7$Shalen##br#
"%n%, right now the fight against the Charm Queen#br#
is taking place in the Haunted Passage. Follow me. I'll take you to support the two princes!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"Are you ready? Come with me, quickly!"#npc$$1$1#

*Accepting this quest will teleport you to the Haunted Passage and into battle with the Charm Queen.|
15022|#&7$Alex##br#
"These Sandworm Burrowers are really quite disgusting."#npc$$828$1#|
15023|#&7$Alex##br#
"In the end, the two of us were left behind."#br#
Alex winces with frustration.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Odum and Para went off in pursuit. I wonder if it will be dangerous for them?"#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
After hearing %p% speak, you suddenly feel that there is something strange going on.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"It's true. It almost seemed too easy. #br#
It just doesn't feel right, given power of the Charm Queen.#br#
She just fled, as if she didn't want to face us head-on..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
If her retreat really was deliberate,#br#
what exactly is she up to?"#char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I just can't figure it out. That's why I didn't say anything."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"There's no time to imagine all the possible scenarios.#br#
We still need to get rid of these Sandworm Burrowers,#br#
and figure out a way to catch up with Odum and the others."#npc$$821$1#|
15024|Shalen tells you that Odum and the others have chased the Charm Queen to the Haunted Passage. Now they're mustering their troops at the entrance and preparing for the second battle with the Charm Queen. He asks you to hurry on and provide support.

Speak with Shalen and ask him to take you to the Haunted Passage.|
15031|#&7$Alex##br#
"I don't know what's going on, #br#
but I keep feeling like there is some kind of strange force here..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Alex, %n%, #br#
I just took a quick walk around. I don't think it's a good idea to continue along this path.#br#
The Sandworm Burrowers are completely blocking the road."#br#
Penny suddenly appears and interrupts Alex.#M106030$Penny$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Penny? #br#
"Didn't I say it was dangerous here? What are you doing here?"#br#
Alex says impatiently.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
After hearing Alex, Penny shuts her mouth, stares at him for a bit,#br#
then walks away.#M106030$Penny$3001$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Did they get into a fight?"#br#
%p% asks you in a quiet whisper.#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod at %p%. When you ran into them at Candeo Marsh#br#
they were bickering constantly. This must be the only way they communicate.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"This is so annoying. It's just going to create more problems for me."#br#
Alex seems irritated after seeing Penny leave.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Alex what the next step is.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I need to take inventory of our troops before I can start the next operation.#br#
There are two things I need to take care of, so I'll have to split the troops."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I keep feeling like there is some unknown force at work here. There may be something strange going on.#br#
I want to send a few people to survey the situation up ahead,#br#
and a few others to get rid of those Sandworms blocking the road."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Alex#br#
that you'll accompany the soldiers taking out the Sandworm Burrowers.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"That sounds good. You're quite skilled, and you should be able to clean them out pretty efficiently.#br#
I'll let you take care of that."#npc$$821$1#|
15032|#&7$Alex##br#
"Penny is just going to make trouble for me."#npc$$1$1#|
15033|#&7$Alex##br#
"Everyone, stay calm. Everything's okay."#br#
You see Alex hurriedly placate the soldiers before him. #br#
Several of the soldiers whisper among themselves, and they all look pale.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Scout##br#
"There are ghosts... ghosts!"#M121010$Scout$828$1#

#&7$Scout##br#
"I don't like this... I want to go home..."#M123010$Scout$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Alex what happened.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I sent these Scouts to investigate the situation up ahead#br#
and they came back in a panic.#br#
They said they saw a whole crowd of ghosts."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I don't know how long it will be before they regain their composure.#br#
I can't get any information out of them right now."#br#
Alex looks very distressed.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Let me take care of the situation here. #br#
You go find Penny and tell her she should go back."#npc$$1$1#|
15034|Alex senses a mysterious force. He plans to send some soldiers to survey the situation up ahead, and you volunteer to go with a separate group to clear out the Sandworm Tunnelers blocking your path.

Eliminate the Sandworm Tunnelers and clear the way.|
15041|#&7$%n%##br#
You relay Alex's message to Penny.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"What? That stupid Alex. He's so ungrateful!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Don't look at me that way. There's nothing wrong with being a healer,#br#
particularly in these unusual times. It's a good thing that I'm able to come here and help.#br#
I'm not just going to pack it in."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"So, %n%, can you do me a favor?#br#
I need you to defeat the Sandworms that keep crawling out of the ground#br#
and collect their membranes."#br#
Penny looks at you expectantly.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
%p% looks at you with horror,#br#
wondering why you'd need such a thing.#pet$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"%p%, stop making that face.#br#
There are certainly more battles to come and I'm afraid that we don't have enough bandages.#br#
After these Sandworm membranes are disinfected, we can use them as bandages.#br#
You should both feel very fortunate."#npc$$821$1#|
15042|#&7$Penny##br#
"Strange... the Sandworm Burrowers shouldn't act like this..."#br#
Penny appears concerned.#npc$$828$1#|
15043|#&7$%n%##br#
You carefully hand over the Membranes to Penny.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Yes, that's what we need."#br#
Penny takes the membranes with both hands and puts them into a clean bag.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Just now, when you were collecting the Membranes, I was thinking:#br#
why did the battle cause the Sandworms to emerge from the ground?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"They normally live deep underground,#br#
so things that happen on the surface shouldn't affect them at all."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Anyway, than you for collecting these membranes for me.#br#
I'm going to start disinfecting them and get them ready to use as bandages."#npc$$1$1#|
15044|Penny is unwilling to follow Alex's order to leave the frontlines. In fact, she wants you to help her by collecting Sandworm membranes. She says that once they're disinfected, they can be used as bandages.

Defeat the Sandworm Biters, then collect their membranes and give them to Penny.|
15051|#&7$Alex##br#
"The frightened scouts have finally calmed down."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"According to their reports, there is a pack of snails up ahead,#br#
and some ghosts floating around. When they got closer,#br#
they felt nauseous and short of breath."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I'm wondering whether that place is the source of this strange feeling I have..."#br#
Alex pauses for a moment.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"What about Penny?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Alex that Penny is unwilling to leave.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Doesn't she know how dangerous it is here?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Forget it. %n%,#br#
go ask Penny about the snails. She should know more about them.#br#
Just don't tell her that I told you to ask her."#npc$$1$1#|
15052|#&7$Alex##br#
"Did you ask Penny? What did she say?"#npc$$823$1#|
15053|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Alex what Penny said:#br#
that the snails might be here because of residual magic.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"If that's the case, we might have some extra work to do."#npc$$1$1#|
15054|Alex says that the soldiers have reported a pack of snails up ahead, and several ghosts floating around them. It seems that this is the source of Alex's strange feeling. Alex asks you to ask Penny about the snails.

Ask Penny about the snails for Alex.|
15055|#&7$%n%##br#
You talk to Penny about the snails and ghosts, and ask her what she thinks.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I'm guessing Alex told you to ask me this. Am I right?"#npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Penny immediately guesses correctly, but Alex asked you#br#
to not let Penny know he sent you.#br#
All you can do is shake your head and say no.#npc$$807$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I know it was, even if you don't say so! #br#
Hmph, that Alex needs my help again. #br#
I can't believe he sent you to talk to me. He should have come here and asked me himself."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Penny that you need to know about the snails right away#br#
so you can figure out what's happening up ahead.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Okay, okay - I won't make things difficult for you."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"The snails you mentioned sound like a species native to Mushroom Forest.#br#
They are very sensitive to magic and will gather wherever there is a high concentration of it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You recall that Caresha in Mushroom Village said something similar.#br#
In that case, she asked you to use the snails to locate the source of the magic that was disrupting the village.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"Of course. Caresha is a member of the magic division.#br#
She would certainly know the special qualities of Soulless Snails."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"My guess is that those ghosts are a form of residual magic.#br#
That's why the Snails are gathering there.#br#
Perhaps if you search the area you can find more clues."#npc$$1$1#|
15061|#&7$Alex##br#
"%n%,#br#
I'd like you to investigate the place the soldiers were talking about and search for relevant clues.#br#
While you're there, take care of those snails so they don't impede our progress."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I still have some doubts about this. #br#
I'll go talk to Penny and clarify the details."#npc$$1$1#|
15062|#&7$Penny##br#
"Are you investigating the ghosts the soldiers saw?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"I really want to go with you and have a look, #br#
but if Alex were to find out,#br#
I'm sure I'd never hear the end of it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"If you find out anything, though, please tell me!"#npc$$1$1#|
15063|#&7$%n%##br#
You give the strange fragments that you found in the pile of dirt to Penny and ask her to identify them.#char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Penny##br#
"These fragments are seriously damaged. I can't tell what they are..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Can you do it or not? If not, move aside and let a professional take care of it."#M137010$Alex$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"It looks like the fragments can be pieced back together. It'll just take some time."#br#
Penny looks at Alex and chooses to ignore him.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod your head and mention the ghosts near the snails.#br#
The ghostly apparitions look like a group of sorcerers.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Residual magic, ghosts, sorcerers...#br#
These clues don't seem sufficient to unravel this mystery."#M137010$Alex$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"The only thing we have left is the fragments that you found.#br#
Maybe they'll be the key to this mystery."#M137010$Alex$1$1#
|
15064|Alex asks you to investigate the site up ahead, search for relevant clues, and clear out any snails you encounter. He will find Penny and ask for details about the snails.

Go investigate the scene and clear out the Soulless Snails.|
15071|#&7$Penny##br#
"I've already pieced together some of the fragments. There are only a few left.#br#
%n%, can you come and help?"#npc$$821$1#|
15072|#&7$Penny##br#

15073|#&7$Penny##br#
"There are a few Fragments missing, but you can see a faint trace...#br#
Here, it looks like the Glyphed Shackles..."#br#
Penny carefully examines the broken pieces.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You remember that the Wizards in Fel Town confronted the Charm Queen, and were cursed with the Glyphed Shackles.#br#
After they were cursed, they couldn't fight back, and were captured by the rebel wizards.#br#
You hurry and tell this to Penny and Alex.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"If the wizards that were captured were cursed in this way,#br#
that means they were here before.#br#
But why were the rune fragments in a pile of dirt?"#M137010$Alex$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"There are some strange burn marks on the fragments. I've only seen them in books before.#br#
If a creature is cursed, then burn marks like these appear#br#
when its energy is extracted."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Penny##br#
"However, the magic used to extract this energy has always been considered forbidden. #br#
This is because the creature's life will fade as its energy is extracted..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"That means... I'm afraid that the wizards that were captured have already lost their lives."#br#
Alex's expression becomes very solemn.#M137010$Alex$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
After hearing this terrible news, you think back to what happened in Mushroom Forest.#char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
The Soporific Spores caused heavy casualties among the vanguard units. #br#
This led the wizards of Fel Town to rebel, killing the captive wizards.#br#
All these things must be the work of the Charm Queen...#char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
After thinking about this, you remind Alex#br#
that the Charm Queen is very crafty and shouldn't be underestimated.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"%n%, you're right. #br#
One thing I'm concerned about is that the Makar have focused on purifying Titan's Grove for some time now,#br#
but it seems like the charm magic in the air has not only not dispersed, it's actually become more intense."#M137010$Alex$821$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I suspect this is connected to the Charm Queen, but I don't know if she's just playing tricks.#br#
I hope Tatiana can learn more in Titan's Grove."#M137010$Alex$1$1#|

"Great! This is exactly what I want! "#br#
Maya grabs the Avian Artifact from your hands and looks at it carefully.#npc$$1$1#

"Why you want to remove that potion's effect?#br#
If it wasn't for the potion, you would have been affected by the illusory magic or the Soporific Spores."#br#
Maya seems delighted.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Titan's Root has been heavily corrupted...#br#
not to mention the Charm Queen and Winged Duke are both there.#br#
I'm sure it's full of traps and ambushes now."#npc$$821$1#

Para must be in great danger.#br#
However, you only tell Maya that you want to cleanse the corruption,#br#
and that hopefully she can remove the potion's effect.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Maya##br#
"Huh! How arrogant. Do whatever you want!#br#
But the effect of the potion can only be removed by time."#npc$$826$1#

"I can't help you, and I have no reason to do so.#br#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"Though I know little about herbalism, #br#
I believe there must be a way #br#
to remove the effect faster than simply waiting.#br#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"I think Alex could give us some advice.#br#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"As far as I know,#br#
Alex and Penny may be skilled herbasists.#br#
But unfortunately, I doubt it will be easy#br#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"However, Alex, as an experienced Templar,#br#
may have his own way of breaking into Titan's Root.#br#
Have some faith. They will see it done."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"As for Emerald Marsh, #br#

It's indeed the habitat of those drakes.#br#
Drakes are fierce and aggressive creatures, #br#
but they barely leave their habitat."#npc$$821$1#

"They shouldn't be a threat to Emerald Town. HoweverK"#npc$$1$1#

You're skeptical#br#
and ask Victoria the details of the mission.#char$$828$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"It's a rescue mission.#br#
Zachary will explain it.#br#
I must go back to the meeting now."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"%n%, it's nice to see you here.#br#
I just came to say hi.#br#
Thank you for helping us out here in Emerald Marsh."#M134010$Victoria$821$1#|

Set up Detectors to the north and south of Emerald Town, then report to Zachary.|
15291|#&7$Zachary##br#
"Now I'm going to explain#br#
the mission Victoria just mentioned."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"I take it that you all know Slim Sye,#br#
the unfortunate lad who had to undergo emergency surgery.#br#
 He's now in a coma, ##br#
but continues to babble on and froth at the mouth."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"We've strung together a few key words #br#
from his mumblings#br#
such as silk, bones, drake..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"So,#br#
we've concluded that he must have come from Cobweb Forest. #br#
The villagers who were abducted#br#
are probably imprisoned somewhere in there too."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"I've sent someone to sniff out Cobweb Forest,#br#
but an Ebon Drake is holding back the mission."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"Although I considered#br#
dispatching a task force to bring the whole area under control,#br#
but that would only end up frightening the gnomes.#br#
So, that's not such a bright idea."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"Instead,#br#
I think it would be more appropriate to send in a small force to dispense with the Ebon Drake.#br#
But I can't spare the manpower."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$"In all of Emerald Town#br#
you're the only one I can rely on to carry out this mission."#npc$$821$1#|
15292|#&7$Zachary##br#
"Those captured villagers must have sustained #br#
quite a number of injuries in the battle.#br#
If we don't save them fast#br#
 they may die before we get there."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"We have to act fast#br#
 and make up for lost time."#npc$$1$1#|
15293|#&7$%n%##br#
You report back to Zachary about the Ebon Drake.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Zachary##br#
I've received a report from a reconnaissance unit.#br#
They've begun investigating.#br#
It's all thanks to you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Not far off,#br#
Victoria and Carrick are looking grave.#br#
They seem to be discussing something fairly important.#char$$2$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I understand.#br#
I'll continue the assault on Turbine Settlement."#M128010$Carrick$822$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"If there's any change in the strategy, #br#
please inform me immediately.#br#
I have to return to Turbine Settlement to lead the attack.#br#
Every minute there is crucial."#M128010$Carrick$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Carrick,"#br#
I'll leave Turbine Settlement in your hands.#br#
With your experience, I'm sure everything will be fine."#M134010$Victoria$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
When she's finished talking to Carrick#br#
she notices you and Zachary#br#
and walks over.#M134010$Zachary$3001$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"The military conference is over.#br#
Carrick and I are going to operate separately.#br#
He'll be responsible for the attack and I'll be responsible for saving the prisoners."#M134010$"Victoria$2$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Carrick was a subordinate of my father.#br#
Ever since my father passed away, he's been waiting and ready in Oblitus Wood. #br#
With his wealth of experience#br#
dealing with the Karok Gnomes in Turbine Settlement will make it a piece of cake."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Officer Zachary, #br#
how's the investigation work going in Cobweb Forest?#M134010$Victoria$821$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"Ma'am.#br#
After clearing the Ebon Drake, the investigation has really taken off.#br#
According to a report from private Bessie,#br#
the captured villagers have already been found."#npc$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Since we already know their position,#br#
the next step is the rescue mission.#br#
Issue an order to Bessie and send her some reinforcements.#br#
Tell her to gather as much intelligence as possible for the rescue mission."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"Yes Ma'am.#br#
I'll send someone with the message this very moment."#npc$$822$0#

How are more troops to be sent?#char$$821$0#

#&7$"Regarding manpower,#br#
at the request of Ronny and the other villagers#br#
we're going to allow the village militia to join in.#br#
There's no need to worry."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"The militia haven't had the benefit of official training.#br#
You might have to be a bit careful,#br#
especially with Ronny. He reminds me of how I used to be,#br#
which is due cause for worry."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#|
15294|Zachary says that Slim Sye has been muttering key words to do with Cobweb Forest in his coma. The abducted villagers are probably in Cobweb Forest. The reconnaissance unit, however, has been can't investigate any deeper because of some pesky drakes. Lend a hand in eliminating the Ebon Drake to help the mission.

Proceed to the entrance to Cobweb Forest and exterminate the Ebon Drake and the Foehn Drake to facilitate the investigation.|
15301|#&7$Zachary##br#
"Officer Victoria,#br#
 we've already sent reinforcements to Bessie."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Thank you Zachary."#br#
She nods and turns towards you.#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"%n%, I know this is a little sudden,#br#
but I'd like to give you command over the operation in Cobweb Forest."#M134010$Victoria$821$1#

You accept the post of command,#br#
but the decision confuses you a little.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"While you're carrying out the rescue mission,#br#
I'll lead my troops on a raid in gnome-occupied territory#br#
to prevent them from sending backup to Cobweb Forest.#br#
This is will ensure that your rescue mission can proceed uninterrupted.#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"It's all written on this order.#br#
Meet up with the reconnaissance troops in Cobweb Forest#br#
and pass the order on to them."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

"Bessie will tell you the details.#br#
Take a look at Cobweb Forest with your own eyes."#M134010$Victoria$821$1#|
15302|#&7$Bessie##br#
I heard Geno say#br#
 that the commanding officer was sending reinforcements.#br#
But we've been waiting for ages."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"With more manpower#br#
the investigation will speed up."#npc$$1$1#|
15303|#&7$%n%##br#
You give Victoria's order to Bessie,#br#
 who immediately opens and reads it.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"So you're the famous %n%.#br#
I've heard many of my comrades sing your praises.#br#
I certainly didn't think that I'd have the chance to carry out a mission with you."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
On hearing your name#br#
Ronny immediately approaches.#M303011$Ronny$3001$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
He looks like he has something to report,#br#
but doesn't dare to interrupt Bessie.#M303011$Ronny$828$1#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"We've received an order from commanding officer Victoria.#br#
She's requested that we gather as much intelligence as possible.#br#
Officer Geno and a few other comrades are out investigating#br#
and observing the prisoners' situation.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"The captured villagers are in the heart of Cobweb Forest.#br#
From what we've been able to gather, the situation is far from ideal.#br#
They are wounded and are being forced to dig."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You're surprised to hear the word 'dig',#br#
and ask Bessie what she means.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"At the moment, we are unable to ascertain the purpose of the digging.#br#
We've tried investigating further, but have been unsuccessful."#br#
She responds with a pained look.#npc$$821$1#|
15304|Victoria has given you command over Cobweb Forest. She's hoping that you'll take over rescue operation while she carries out a raid on gnome-occupied territory. The mission requires independent action to be successful.

Take the order that Victoria has given you to Bessie in Cobweb Forest to find out more.|
15311|#&7$Ronny##br#
"Officer, we have an emergency on our hands.#br#
Just now, when I went to observe the state of the prisoners,#br#
I discovered a Drone Patrol on the northern path to the location."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"By the looks of things,#br#
the patrol should have been over in Turbine Settlement,#br#
but its been forced to work for the gnomes."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Although the gnomes' know-how is no match for the dwarves, #br#
we can't ignore its surveillance abilities."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
It looks like the northern path is a no-go.#br#
You ask Ronny if the southern path is viable.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
There's a path there,#br#
but if we approach from the south,#br#
we'll bump into the habitat of the Aqua Iguana."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"The Aqua Iguana has a very well-developed sense of smell.#br#
If we just dive in there, there'll be hell to pay.#br#
We need to refine our tactics if we're going to pull it off."#br#
He reaches into his pockets and pulls out a small bag.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"When I found out that I was coming to Cobweb Forest for an investigation,#br#
I did a little prep work. This is bait for hunting.#br#
It's the favorite food of the Aqua Iguana."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Use this Bait#br#
to attract the Aqua Iguana.#br#
While they're fighting over the Bait,#br#
use opportunity to thin their numbers."#npc$$1$1#|
15312|#&7$Ronny##br#
"But whatever you do,#br#
don't open the Bait before you get there."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"The Bait has a strong odor.#br#
You have to use it#br#
to attract them at the right time."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"If you open it at the wrong moment,#br#
even just a crack,#br#
they'll smell it immediately."|
15313|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Ronny and Bessie that you've prepared the Bait.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"It looks like the Bait tactic has worked.#br#
What's next?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"Seeing as the Aqua Iguanas to the south have already been diverted,#br#
let's destroy the Drone Patrol."#M123010$Bessie$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod in agreement.#char$$806$0#

#&7$Bessie##br#
When the Drone Patrol is down#br#
the troops and I will charge in there to the rescue.#br#
Our number one priority is to protect the safety of the prisoners."#M123010$Bessie$821$1#|
15314|Ronny tells you that there's a Drone Patrol on the northern path leading to the prisoners' location. To the south is the Aqua Iguana's habitat. Use the Bait to divert them.

Go to the Aqua Iguana's habitat in Cobweb Forest and use the Bait to distract the Aqua Iguanas' attention and reduce their numbers.|
15321|#&7$Bessie##br#
"I have some ideas about the Drone Patrol.#br#
Because Turbine Settlement has fallen to the Karok Gnomes,#br#
I think that the machines from Turbine Settlement must have been adapted by the Gnomes#br#
and even used in battle."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"So,#br#
I've developed a strategy to deal with the Drone Patrol, among other things."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"I've borrowed the Interfering Transmitter from Lawrence.#br#
Use it to disable#br#
the Drone Patrol."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"%n%, take this Interfering Transmitter.#br#
Our whole rescue operation may depend on it."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Bessie##br#
"I'm going to get in touch with Geno, who's currently investigating,#br#
to tell him to start with the preparations.#br#
Once the Drone Patrol is gone, we'll dive in there to the rescue."#npc$$821$1#|
15322|#&7$Geno##br#
"I've already received Bessie's letter.#br#
I've told my comrades to get ready." #npc$$1$1#

"Once the Drone Patrol is disabled,#br#
we'll move in straight away."#npc$$821$1#|

You tell Geno that the Drone Patrol has been completely disabled.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
Thanks to you,#br#
we can now extract the prisoners safely.#br#
But there's one thing left to do..."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You follow Geno's gaze.#br#
A female gnome is struggling to#br#
break free from the ropes binding her.#char$$2$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"According to the intelligence that we've collected, and judging from her outfit,#br#
we think that she's the Karok Sorceress."#npc$$1$1#|
15324|Bessie proposes conducting a joint rescue operation with Geno. You'll use the Interfering Transmitter to disable the Drone Patrol. Geno will use that moment to rescue the prisoners.

15331|#&7$Ronny##br#
"%n%, I have a favor to ask you.#br#
In Emerald Town,#br#
Augustus asked the soldiers to collect various Mechanical Parts#br#
due to a shortage of materials."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Since the Drone Patrol has been destroyed,#br#
we could salvage some Circuit Boards#br#
and reuse them."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"I'm guessing that Geno can't spare the manpower to do this,#br#
so why don't you give the Circuit Boards to him#br#

15332|#&7$Geno##br#
"Strange.#br#
I feel like I've forgotten something."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"An important request, perhaps.#br#
I should be able to remember it..."#npc$$1$1#|
15333|#&7$%n%##br#
You give the Circuit Boards to Geno.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"Why are you giving me these Circuit Boards all of a sudden?#br#
Do they have any special use?"#npc$$1$1#

You remind him about collecting resources.#br#
Augustus needs these things.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"Right you are.#br#
I was too busy with what I was doing.#br#
I almost forgot about Augustus' request."#br#
He lights up with recognition.#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"I'll pass these Circuit Boards#br#
on to Augustus. But I have something#br#
even more important to report to you."#npc$$1$1#|
15334|Ronny remembers that Augustus requested the Soldiers to help collect some Circuit Boards. He hopes that after you've defeated the Drone Patrol, you'll help him to collect some Circuit Boards and ease the resource shortage in Emerald Town.

15341|#&7$Geno##br#
"While we were trying to comfort the prisoners,#br#
we asked about the digging#br#
and learned the terrible truth."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"The gnomes wanted them to dig up#br#
eggs with an ancient seal.#br#
The eggs had only been sealed#br#
and weren't dead."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"By using magic to remove the seal,#br#
the eggs hatched,#br#
spawning into Dark Gremlins."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"Once the prisoners became aware of this terrible fact,#br#
they were determined to stop the digging.#br#
Slim Sye was in charge of the plan."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"They caused a diversion during the night#br#
to aid Slim Sye in stealing the Gnome Chief's Scepter of Resurrection, along with his plans. #br#
Although many lost their lives in the effort,#br#
they successfully put a halt to the digging."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"This matter is of the utmost importance.#br#
It may be best to ask the prisoners directly to get a better idea of what happened."#npc$$825$1#|
15342|#&7$Geno##br#
"I had no idea the gnomes were looking for eggs,#br#
and eggs with an ancient seal no less."#npc$$821$1#

Once all is settled here,#br#
I must hurry back to Emerald Town to report on the situation."#npc$$1$1#|

You tell Geno about what the prisoners said.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"I see.#br#
For the eggs to spawn Dark Gremlins, they need the Karok Sorceress and the Scepter of Resurrection.#br#
They can't do without either."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You assert that such an important matter#br#
should be immediately reported back to Emerald Town.#br#
The Dark Gremlins that were dug up also need to be eliminated.#char$$1$0#

and combine our power to destroy the gnomes once and for all?"#npc$$821$1#|
15362|#&7$Geno##br#
"That's strange. The Karok Warlocks shouldn't be as defenseless as this."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"Maybe it's a diversion.#br#
We must be careful."#npc$$1$1#|
15363|#&7$%n%##br#
You report to Geno that you've already destroyed the Karok Warlocks,#br#
but find her knitting her brows.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"The Karok Sorceress is gone!#br#
So that was their goal."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"How could I fall#br#
for such an obvious trick?!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You try to comfort Geno#br#
and remind her that there's still time to pursue them.#br#
You ask whether she knows in which direction they fled.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"%n%,you're right.#br#
Judging from their footprints,#br#
I'd say that they fled in the direction of the Dark Gremlins."#npc$$821$1#|
15364|Geno is worried that the Karok Warlocks that have congregated to the south will head to Turbine Settlement and add to Carrick's troubles. She's decided to exterminate the Karok Warlocks with your aid.

Slay the Karok Warlocks in Cobweb Forest to prevent them from returning to Turbine Settlement.|
15371|#&7$Geno##br#
"That won't do. If the Karok Warlocks join forces with the Dark Gremlins#br#
their strength will swell."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"We have to hurry on ahead of them#br#
and destroy the Dark Gremlins in one fell swoop.#br#
If we can recapture the Karok Sorceress, then so much the better."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"That said,#br#
I don't think that the Karok Sorceress will surrender quietly.#br#
She'll definitely have something up her sleeve.#br#
If we're not careful, we may fall into her trap."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"%n%, you need to carry out this mission with the utmost caution."#npc$$825$1#|
15372|#&7$Geno##br#
"The Karok Sorceress' power is second to none!#br#
She prepared the potion for the Karok settlement.#br#
I've heard that she's mixed a violent poison#br#
that robs whoever drinks it of all reason, turning them into monster."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"I don't know whether it's true or not,#br#
but it would be best to be careful."#npc$$1$1#|
15373|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Geno about the Karok Sorceress' poison.#br#
It may be necessary to kill her instead of capturing her.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Geno##br#
"It would be a shame not to capture the Karok Sorceress alive,#br#
but at least the operation will be a success.#br#
Without the Karok Sorceress#br#
the Gnomes won't be able to hatch the Dark Gremlin Eggs."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Geno##br#
"The most important thing for now is to relay this intelligence to our superiors#br#
and take the wounded back to Emerald Town for treatment.#br#
Let's set off."#npc$$1$1#|
15374|Geno has discovered that the Karok Warlocks and the Karok Sorceress are fleeing in the direction of the Dark Gremlins. If they join forces with the Dark Gremlins, the consequences will be dire.

"But before you meet up with them,#br#
I have a small favor to ask."#npc$$821$1#|
15384|Victoria only found plans on Slim Sye's person. The key details have been magically sealed. The whereabouts of the Scepter of Resurrection are unknown. Where was it lost? The Medical Officer who treated Slim Sye seems to have found some clues.

Talk with the Medical Officer who looked after Slim Sye. Then talk with Zachary to find out more about the state of the search party. |
15385|#&7$%n%##br#
You ask the Medical Officer about Slim Sye.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Medical Officer##br#
"Slim Sye...#br#

was unable to save him."#npc$$829$1#

"While I was looking after him,#br#
I discovered older wounds,#br#
that had been treated with first aid."#npc$$821$1#

Without the help someone else,#br#
they would have been impossible to treat."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Medical Officer##br#
"The balm near the wound,#br#
seemed not be an common ointment,#br#

The bandages resembled those of primitive tribes."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Medical Officer##br#
"Before Slim Sye fled here,#br#
he must have stopped somewhere."#npc$$821$1#|
15391|#&7$Zachary##br#
"I've discovered that since the search party started looking,#br#
the Iguanas to the south of Emerald Town have drawn nearer.#br#
Perhaps the search party disturbed them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"If we ignore the Iguanas,#br#
they may penetrate Emerald Town's defenses.#br#
But we have no more manpower to drive them out."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zachary##br#
"Here's what we'll do.#br#

"We've searched all over the marsh#br#
without finding a thing.#br#
We're thinking of continuing the search to the south."#M012011$Pierre$1$1#

"But I heard that there was a war to the south.#br#
If we approach the area, we may be drawn into the conflict.#br#

#&7$Militia##br#
"Pierre is right.#br#
We've been active in the area before,#br#

"This place#br#

15394|To save Emerald Town from attack, Zachary asks you to eliminate the Iguanas on your way to meet the search party.

15401|#&7$Pierre##br#
"Although the area to the south is only on the outskirts of the battle,#br#
I think we shouldn't risk it."#M012011s85h+70$Pierre$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"A moment ago, I used the Metal Detector Robot to conduct some tests.#br#
The results to the south were very strange."#br#
He says muttering and looking at a piece of paper covered with scribbled numbers.#M012011$Pierre$1$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Maybe its because the metal weapons were damaged#br#
in the fierce battle."#M012011$Pierre$2$1#

"Just to be sure,#br#
we should take the Metal Detector Robot over there to investigate.#br#

activate it, and start detecting."#M012011$Pierre$1$1#|
15403|#&7$Pierre##br#
"I've just heard explosions to the south west.#br#
Has the Demon Army found you?"#M012011s85h+70$Pierre$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Pierre that something seems to be hidden in the marsh.#br#
The explosion occurred when the Robot was hit by a strange beam of light.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"A strange beam of light?#br#
The marsh shouldn't have such things."#M012011$Pierre$823$1#

"Luckily I've caught up..."#br#
He seems almost unable to breath.#M121010$Messenger$821$1#

"We've finally decoded magically sealed plans.#br#
There's a defense plan.#br#
Countless metal mines have been hidden in Otter Marsh!"#br#
Messenger$826$1#

#&7$Messenger##br#
"Their targets are Robots.#br#
When they detect the propulsion system of a Robot,#br#
the mines arm themselves#br#
and shoot strong, explosive beams of light."#M121010$Messenger$1$1#

It looks like the metal mines#br#
destroyed Pierre's Robots.#char$$806$0#

15411|#&7$Reymon##br#
"Goodness,#br#
that explosion has startled the Raging Otters.#br#
They're heading in our direction."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Reymon where the Raging Otters are.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"They're to the south of Otter Marsh.#br#
That sound is proof that they're moving in our direction."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"Judging from the speed at which they're moving,#br#
we aren't going to be able to pull out#br#
before they get here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"But if we don't flee quickly,#br#
we'll be torn to pierces#br#
by their strength and numbers."#npc$$1$1#

and leave the Raging Otters to you.#char$$806$0#|
15412|#&7$Reymon##br#
"The last time that I saw Raging Otters move like this#br#

crushing whatever stands in their way.#br#
They even trample down large trees."#npc$$1$1#

"Even now, I remember#br#
the sight with awe and horror."|
15413|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Reymon that you've already dealt with the Raging Otters.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"You're right...I can't hear their stampeding.#br#
How did you do it?"#br#
He looks astonished.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You say there was nothing to it.#br#
At least it's over.#br#
You tell him not to be so scared.#char$$806$0#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"Huh...%n%."#br#
He breathes deeply#br#
and seems to have calmed down a little.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"While we're on the topic, the areas trampled by the Raging Otters#br#
didn't set off the mines, even though the detector robot was attacked in those same areas."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You were wondering the same thing.#br#
It's very strange that the swarm of Raging Otters didn't set off the#br#
land mines.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I think I've got the answer, let me explain.#br#
I think that the land mines were designed specifically for robots.#br#
They only react when they detect a source of propulsion."#br#
Pierre butts in.#M012011s85h+70$Pierre$1$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"I never thought we'd come across this kind of land mine.#br#
All of my mine removers#br#

"I'd like to concentrate on removing the mines,#br#
but it looks like we've run into a bit of a problem."#M012011$Pierre$828$1#|
15414|Reymon has found out that Raging Otters are fleeing to Otter Marsh. If they're not stopped, they'll do some serious damage.

Travel to the south of Otter Marsh and exterminate the Raging Otters.|
15421|#&7$Reymon##br#
"I think I know what Pierre is trying to say.#br#
The explosion didn't only startle the Raging Otters.#br#
It also attracted the attention of the Karok Gnomes."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"I just discovered a few Karok Seekers lurking around in the vicinity.#br#
They were carefully inspecting every nook and cranny.#br#
They must have been looking for the Scepter of Resurrection."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"Our search has been hampered by these land mines.#br#
We can't let the Karok Seekers find the Scepter of Resurrection before us.#br#
What's more, if they discover us,#br#
they may launch an attack."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You agree with Reymon#br#
and tell him that you are prepared to drive away the Karok Seekers.#char$$806$0#|
15422|#&7$Reymon##br#
"Without the Scepter of Resurrection,
the Dark Gremlin Eggs will be unable to hatch.#br#
We can't let the scepter fall into their hands."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"Once Pierre has devised a way to remove the landmines,#br#
we'll be able to proceed quickly with the search.#br#
As to how to deal with the Karok Seekers, I'll leave that to you."#npc$$1$1#|
15423|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Reymon that the Karok Seekers have already been driven away.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"Great...#br#
I should think that the Karok Seekers won't dare#br#
come near here again in the short term.#br#
We can use the time to concentrate on removing the landmines."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"While you were eradicating the Karok Seekers#br#
I tried modifying the mine removal robots,#br#
to conceal their propulsion mechanisms.#br#
But everything failed."#M012011s85h+70$Pierre$1$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"No matter what I do,#br#
there's no evading the sensitive detection system of the land mines."#M012011$Pierre$2$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Our only way is to#br#
remove the propulsion mechanism from the robots,#br#
and alter their design#br#
so that they can be controlled manually.#br#
We'll have to remove the landmines by hand."#M012011$Pierre$1$1#

#&7$Pierre##br#
"Don't worry. To avoid difficulties,#br#
I will make them easy to operate.#br#
You'll take to it like a fish to water."#M012011$Pierre$1$1#

15424|Reymon has found out that the explosions have not only startled the Raging Otters, they've also alerted the Karok Seekers, who are searching Otter Marsh for the lost Scepter of Resurrection. Reymon has asked you to drive them away, to prevent the scepter from falling into their hands.

Drive the Karok Seekers out of Otter Marsh.|

"After Abu told me #br#
the Central Power System was gone, #br#
I came here to set up a sort of detector."#M050061s85h+70$Acey$2$1#

15552|#&7$Acey##br#
"Waterweed Chinchillas are curious by nature,#br#

the process will go much more smoothly."#M050061$Acey$2$1#|

Perfect! This is the Chinchilla Hair I need."#br#
He takes the hair from your hand and puts it into the analyzer. #M050061s85h+70$Acey$821$1#

"Could it beK#br#

15591|#&7$Acey##br#
"I don't know what exactly the Karok Chief wants,#br#

That explains why I can detect it everywhere."#M050061s85h+70$Acey$1$1#

#&7$Acey##br#
"The tremendous energy is twisting the stability of the physical space, #br#
which is generating a Dimensional Fissure.#br#
Those Dimensional Ogres you saw #br#

#&7$Acey##br#
"They're releasing all that magic energy as well.#br#

"The Dimensional Fissure must be somewhere near.#br#
We need to find a way to close it."#M050061$Acey$1$1#|
15594|Acey surmises that the Karok Chief used the energy stored in the Central Power System to open a Dimensional Fissure, which was how the Dimensional Ogres were able to enter this world. Dimensional Ogres release the same energy fluctuation as the Demon Totem, so Acey requests that you slay them all before they spread out. 

Slay the Dimensional Ogres in the Waterweed Wetlands before they affect other native creatures.|
15601|#&7$Acey##br#
"The Dimensional Fissure must be closed.#br#

"We wanted to be able to move troops quickly, #br#
so we asked Augustus to make us a large-scale teleporter.#br#
Then, however, #br#
some Infernal Gremlins spotted it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Silky##br#
"While we were focused on battle, #br#
they snuck into our camp and damaged the teleporter.#br#
Even worse, they also stole our backup Mechanical Parts."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Silky##br#
"To repair the teleporter, #br#
we must retrieve those Mechanical Parts."#npc$$821$1#|
15632|#&7$Randy##br#
"Hmm... these old components will never work.
I need something else."#br#
He picks up an old part in his hand. #M049031s85h+70$Randy$2$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"The output is far, far less than what's required.#br#
When are those supplies going to arrive?"#M049031$Randy$1$1#|
15633|#&7$Randy##br#
"My baby... she's so damaged.#br#
I hope the new parts will be delivered soon."#br#
He carefully checks the machine beside him.#M049031s85h+70$Randy$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You give the Power Source and Mechanical Parts to Randy. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Randy##br#
"Oh? Let me check these outK#br#
They should work#br#
after a bit fixing."#M049031$Randy$2$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"By the way... who are you?#br#
I've never seen you around before."#M049031$Randy$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You introduce yourself #br#
and explain that you're here to help.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Randy##br#
"We'll do our best.#br#
I checked the condition of the teleporter earlier today.#br#
It's badly damaged..."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"But I believe it's still repairable #br#
so long as we have these parts.#br#
We'll get it up and running soon."#M049031$Randy$1$1#|
15634|Silky finds out that the Infernal Gremlins damaged the teleporter and stole its Power Source and Mechanical Parts. Retrieve them from the Infernal Gremlins.

Defeat the Infernal Gremlins and retrieve the Mechanical Parts and Power Source, then report to Randy. |
15641|#&7$Randy##br#
"Now that we have all the materials, #br#
we can start immediately."#M049031s85h+70$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"I'm simply worried that#br#
the Infernal Gremlins may attack us again#br#
while we're repairing the teleporter."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"While you were collecting the parts, #br#
we assembled some Machine Gun Turrets,#br#
but we need someone to set them up."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You say you'd be glad to help. #char$$806$0#

#&7$Randy##br#
"I'll leave it to you then.#br#
Don't worry - it's a simple task."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"We've improved the turrets. #br#
All you need to do is bring them close to the teleporter and activate the devices.#br#
They will start working automatically."#M049031$Randy$2$1#|
15642|#&7$Randy##br#
"The previous turrets were quite impractical.#br#
Even setting them up cost a great deal of time,#br#
so we'd barely used them."#M049031s85h+70$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"That's why we figured we should try and #br#
make some improvements.#br#
Now they just need to be activated, #br#
and the rest will be done automatically."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"What do you think? #br#
Pretty swell, huh?"#M049031$Randy$2$1#|
15643|#&7$Randy##br#
"That's really fast.#br#
You didn't have any trouble setting the turrets up, right? "#M049031s85h+70$Randy$1$1#

You tell Randy the turrets are in position. #char$$806$0#

#&7$Randy##br#
"We'll handle the rest.#br#
I promise the teleporter will be fully repaired soon."#M049031$Randy$2$1#|
15644|Randy requests that you set up Machine Gun Turrets around the teleporter to keep the Infernal Gremlins from disturbing the repair work. 

Use the Machine Gun Turrets near the teleporter.|
15651|#&7$Randy##br#
"Misery really loves company.#br#
What do I do nowK?"#M049031s85h+70$Randy$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Randy what's wrong. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Randy##br#
"I thought those turrets#br#
were enough to keep the Infernal Gremlins away."#M049031$Randy$2$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"At first, #br#
they retreated pretty quickly #br#
after a couple of failed attempts."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"I thought they wouldn't try again...#br#
But now?#br#
We've got Frenzied Ogres up the wazoo!"#M049031$Randy$823$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"These Frenzied Ogres are well-organized.#br#
They seem to be forming a defensive line."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"At this rate, #br#
unless we act now, #br#
we'll never be able to take those things out #br#
even WITH reinforcements."#M049031$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"What about striking them before they're fully prepared?#br#
Guerrilla tactics might be a good choice.#br#
It will buy us some time."#M049031$Randy$1$1#|
15652|#&7$Randy##br#
"Look at those Frenzied Ogres... #br#
so tall and thick. #br#
Standing side by side like that, #br#
they're just like an... Ogre Wall."#M049031s85h+70$Randy$2$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"If they form an effective defensive line, #br#
no one will be able to break through it!"#M049031$Randy$1$1#|
15653|#&7$Randy##br#
"%n%, you've done well.#br#
Watching those ogres run around like that#br#
was really hilarious."#M049031s85h+70$Randy$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Randy how the repairs are going on the Teleportation Device.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Randy##br#
"The Teleportation Device is already fully repaired.#br#
It's as good as new.#br#
Fit to go!#br#
We have you to thank for that."#M049031$Randy$1$1#|
15654|While repairing the Teleportation Device, Randy discovered that, though the Infernal Gremlins had ceased their attack on the Teleportation Device and retreated to the ancient city, countless Frenzied Ogres had appeared in their stead, and they're forming an Ogre Wall.

To prevent the reinforcements from becoming ogre fodder, adopt guerilla warfare tactics and disrupt the Ogre formations.|
15661|#&7$Randy##br#
"The Teleportation Device has already been activated.#br#
I've radioed the Engineer in Smuggler's Cabin to confirm that#br#
the Teleportation Devices at both ends are connected."#M049031s85h+70$Randy$1$1#

#&7$Randy##br#
"What's more,#br#
I can hear Victoria's voice on the other end of the line.#M049031$Randy$2$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"%n%, it's Victoria here.#br#
Can you hear me?"#M134010$Victoria$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You say that you can hear her loud and clear.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"The Teleportation Device is now in operation.#br#
You should be able to use it to get back to the Smuggler's Cabin."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"According to Puckett,#br#
the entrances to the demon base and#br#
the Cadilla Felwood are sealed."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"We need to remove the seal#br#
if we're going to clear them out."#M134010$Victoria$828$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Use the Teleportation Device to come back,#br#
and we'll set off once you're here."#M134010$Victoria$1$1#|
15662|#&7$Victoria##br#
"Once the seal to the Cadilla Felwood has been opened,#br#
there'll be no backing out...#br#
But that's the only way we're going to secure victory."#br#
She murmurs.#npc$$828$1#|
15663|#&7$Victoria##br#
"I never expected all that study would come in handy one day..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You curiously ask what she means.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"...did you know that Carrick once fought by my father's side?#br#
My father also used to be a general."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"He was a devoted soldier.#br#
As a result,#br#
he spent most of his time with his men."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"When I was young,#br#
he was almost a stranger to me,#br#
so we were never very close."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"To rebel... no, I should say prove...#br#
to prove that the path I'd chosen was the right one,#br#
I entered the Ministry of Magic."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"When...#br#
when he died, I-... understood for the first time that he actually meant well.#br#
That was when I decided to become a Templar."#npc$$828$1#|
15664|Victoria says that the demon base is in the heart of the Cadilla Felwood. In order to launch an attack, you need to return to the Smuggler's Cabin using the Teleportation Device and join her in providing protection for Puckett as he unlocks the seal on the Cadilla Felwood.

Use the Teleportation Device to head back to the Cadilla Felwood and protect Puckett until he's unlocked the seal.|
15671|#&7$Victoria##br#
"Ever since the seal to the Cadilla Felwood was removed,#br#
we've been receiving intermittent reports#br#
of Hellberserkers and Hellbringers in the Cadilla Felwood."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"These hellish demons#br#
seem to be conducting a patrol of the perimeter...#br#
almost as if they're setting up a line of defense."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"If we allow them to continue,#br#
our upcoming battle will be all the more difficult.#br#
We'll have lost our advantage."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"%n%, before the army fully assembles,#br#
could you go out there and#br#
stir up a little ruckus to keep them from completing their defenses?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"I've already sent out several small platoons,#br#
to cause some chaos using guerilla tactics.#br#
If you join them,#br#
they will be all the more effective."#npc$$821$1#|
15672|#&7$Silky##br#
"With our dwindling,#br#
we'll be at a disadvantage for sure.#br#
I hope that we'll get more reinforcements."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Silky##br#
"Victoria said that she would send backup,#br#
but when will it arrive?"#npc$$1$1#|
15673|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Silky about unlocking the Cadilla Felwood seal#br#
and the appearance of the demon army.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Silky##br#
"I've also received orders from Victoria.#br#
There are still some platoons out there bombarding them.#br#
We need to get out there and show 'em what we got!"#npc$$821$1#|
15674|After removing the seal to the Cadilla Felwood, Victoria receives news that many demons have begun popping in the woods. They're carrying out organized patrols and setting up a line of defense.

Victoria asks you to join up with a few other platoons and stir up some chaos using guerilla tactics in hopes of preventing them from carrying out their plans.|
15681|#&7$Victoria##br#
"According to news brought by one of our messengers,#br#
the monsters in the Cadilla Felwood#br#
have gotten ahold of some pretty terrifying weapons."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Our normal equipment and shields#br#
won't last long against weaponry like that.#br#
We'll have to adopt more of a hit-and-run strategy."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"In order to build battle-worthy equipment,#br#
I need to collect fragments of their armor as samples.#br#
Even a few will do."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"%n%, perhaps you could collect a few of these#br#
fragments when you're out giving them a pounding.#br#
Take anything you find to the soldiers on the front-lines for analysis.#br#
They will be of great use in future battles."#npc$$821$1#|
15682|#&7$Silky##br#
"Victoria said that she would send over some weapon samples,#br#
but I haven't seen a single one yet.#br#
Maybe she's been attacked by Gnomes?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Silky##br#
"Without samples,#br#
we won't be able to analyze the material.#br#
This could lead to dire consequences in the ensuing battle."#npc$$1$1#|
15683|#&7$%n%##br#
You relay what Victoria said to Silky#br#
and give her the collected fragments.#char$$821$0#

"Perfect. This is just what I need.#br#
I'll give these fragments to the engineers for analysis.#br#
Maybe they'll come up with something we can use."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Silky##br#
"If there are any further developments,#br#
I will inform both you and Victoria."#npc$$1$1#|
15684|Victoria discovered that the equipment of the Hellberserkers and Hellberserkers in the Cadilla Felwood is far better than that of the Vanguard Soldiers. She asks you to obtain fragments of their weapons and armor to give to the engineers on the front-lines for analysis.

15691|#&7$Silky##br#

I must have sold hundreds of ancient artifacts."#M010010$Puckett$1$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"I somehow feel that...#br#
these demons are not new to the forest.#br#
They must have come here long ago."#M010010$Puckett$821$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"This ancient city in the Cadilla Felwood#br#
is their former residence...#br#
which means you're about to fight with the enemy on their own territory."#M010010$Puckett$1$1#

#&7$Puckett##br#
"What's more, they have the Demon Glutton on their side.#br#
With that kind of power,#br#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"This scepter is no doubt the root of much evil and calamity.#br#
So long as it is around,#br#
men of relentless ambition will try to steal it."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"This object cannot fall into the wrong hands.#br#
It should be forever entrenched in darkness."#npc$$826$1#|
15704|Victoria says that the Gnomes' Scepter of Resurrection is still in the camp. She's worried that the demon army will try to find a way to steal it back, so she hopes that you will give the scepter to the Grand Bishop to destroy.

my heart aches."#npc$$1$1#|
15743|#&7$%n%##br#
You report the events of Cadilla Felwood to the Grand Bishop.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Thanks to each and every one of you, #br#
we halted the enemy's advance for the time being. #br#
If their scheme had succeeded, #br#
countless more lives would have been lost."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Not too long ago, #br#
I received a military report from the Starstruck Plateau and Silent Ice Field. #br#
It has become clear to me that Reinhardt won't stop here. #br#
This was only one small part of his overall strategy."#npc$$1$1#

"You have done well, but the next battle will be even harder. #br#
We must summon every last reserve of strength #br#

"We are in dire need of your talents. #br#
I pray that you will continue to fight for our cause!"#npc$$821$1#

You tell him you are ready to do battle #br#
for the glory of the Grand Bishop and his people.#char$$806$0#|
15744|Victoria explains that she's planning to move her troops to the Silent Ice Field.  She asks that you report on the events of Cadilla Felwood to the Grand Bishop.

15751|#&7$Thallium##br#
"%n%, the situation on the front line grows worse with every passing minute.#br#
Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg#br#
are both in need of an Envoy of Gaia like you to join the good fight."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Thallium##br#
"But I believe... Belenus may have something else in store for you.#br#
Once things have settled down in Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg,#br#
I'd like you to head back to Navea and report to Belenus on our current status."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Thallium more about this matter.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Thallium##br#
"Reinhardt... no, I should call him the Shadow Knight..."#br#
Thallium sighs and continues.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Thallium##br#
"The Shadow Knight has used the Cube of Gaia to open a passage to hell.#br#
He has enlisted an entire army of#br#
powerful demons from the darkest depths.#br#
Perhaps you're acquainted with a few of them."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod your head and add that the demons under the Shadow Knight#br#
have gone to great lengths to remove the seals on the dragons in various ruins.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Thallium##br#
"Yes, well, we will need to look into that more carefully. The Ministry of Magic is investigating those matters as we speak.#br#
According to reliable intelligence, the Shadow Knight's forces have already reached the Silent Ice Field.#br#
They will soon reach the grave of Luciana..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Luciana? First I've heard that name.#br#
Is she the Shadow Knight's wife?"#br#
You question Thallium.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Thallium##br#
"Yes. Luciana is Reinhardt's wife.#br#
That horrible incident so long ago remains a source of great regret for us.#br#
The Shadow Knight may have stolen the Cube of Gaia#br#
in order to resurrect Luciana."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Thallium##br#
"But... no, that's... impossible."#br#
Thallium closes her eyes, knits her brow, and seems to lose herself in thought.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You plan to ask more about the "horrible incident" she mentioned,#br#
but when you open your mouth to speak, Thallium waves the subject away with a flick of her wrist.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Thallium##br#
"Anyway, in addition to these two battle-zones, the demons have also taken control of a number of villages."#npc$$821$1#

"Finish this quest, then report to Belenus."#npc$$822$1#|

does not accurately reflect the current states of Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Grand Bishop##br#
The Grand Bishop seems gravely worried about the battle with the demon army.#br#
When he looks at you, he smiles bitterly.#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I... have something to tell you,#br#.
But it will have to wait..."#npc$$821$1#|
15753|#&7$%n%##br#
You relay the statuses of Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg#br#
and give a detailed report to the Grand Bishop about the situation on the front line.#char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"%n%, with your help,#br#
the balance of the battles in Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg has tipped in our favor.#br#
We've successfully prevented the demon army from gaining ground.#br#
The next step is to reconquer lost territory."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Thallium probably mentioned to you#br#
that the Shadow Knight's demon army has occupied many villages and lands.#br#
The locals have either sustained extensive casualties or been enslaved."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I need you to travel to the areas most affected by the war.#br#

Mushroom Forest? When I was fighting in Vulture's Vale,#br#
I heard Odum say that he was preparing to go fight in Mushroom Forest."#pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
The fact that even Odum has rushed to Mushroom Forest is proof#br#
that the situation in Mushroom Forest must be serious.#br#
You ask the Grand Bishop whether he has anything else to tell you.#char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"That's right. Alex's troops and the Makar command post are there.#br#
The forest is in utter turmoil.#br#
Mushroom Forest is under the control of demons."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I would suggest that you start in Mushroom Forest.#br#
Gus will tell you the details."#npc$$827$1#|
15754|Thallium believes that things have calmed down a little in Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg. You must return and report to the Grand Bishop to receive new orders. You are to push forward to lend your aid in territory occupied by the demon army.

"%n%..."#br#
Exhaustion is written all over Gus's face,#br#
but he still manages to smile.#M135010$Gus$1$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"I'm going to have to trouble you again. Please go to Mushroom Village.#br#
The forest has been occupied by the Charm Queen.#br#
Soporific Spores have settled on every tree."#M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The first group of soldiers that we sent in#br#
were infected by the spores and began to massacre each other."#M135010$Gus$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You listen carefully to Gus.#br#
It's no wonder the Grand Bishop wanted you to solve the problem in Mushroom Forest.#br#
The tactics these demons are using are terrifying.#char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The Ministry of Magic has sent people to protect the village,#br#
but if we don't find a way to prevent the spread of Soporific Spores,#br#
the surrounding areas, including those that we've taken back,#br#
will all fall under the control of the demons."#M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You haven't had much contact with the Ministry of Magic.#br#
All you know is that it's a church-affiliated organization that conducts research on magic.#br#
Thallium once said that the Ministry of Magic was researching why dragon kings were being released by demons.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"All right, your main task is to prevent the spread of Soporific Spores.#br#
First, go to Mushroom Village in the Mushroom Forest.#br#

#&7$Gus##br#
"I know that you're a strong Envoy of Gaia,#br#

so as not to fall into a demon's trap."#M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod your head. This battle is the only thing keeping the#br#
Soporific Spores from spreading beyond the forest.#br#
Failure here could mean utter disaster.#char$$806:0$0#|
15762|#&7$Caresha##br#
"Chop chop! Put out the fire before it reaches the village!"#br#
A lady dressed up as a Mage yells to the other Mages.#npc$$826$1#|
15763|#&7$%n%##br#
You find Caresha in Mushroom Village. She looks like she has her hands full.#br#
The Mages in the village are busy establishing a defensive line and treating the injured.#char$$1$0#

"Oh, I know you! You're %n%,#br#.
It's great that you're here - we're short of men."#br#
Caresha scrutinizes you.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"The Mages under my command have to continue casting defensive magic#br#
to prevent the Soporific Spores from infecting the village.#br#
But that's not all that we've got to do..."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Look around you. Nothing but wounded soldiers.#br#
If no one treats them,#br#
they'll only get worse."#npc$$827$1#|

#&7$Gus##br#
"We've set up a line of defense in Emerald Town.#br#
One of the templars, Victoria, will be assuming command.#br#
Augustus's armored platoon is also there."#M135010$Gus$824$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Emerald Marsh is under attack.#br#
The demon army has brought the Gnome tribes together.#br#
They launched a night raid on a Dwarf village, killing nearly everyone."#M135010$Gus$826$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"One of the surviving Dwarves reported to a neighboring village.#br#

You ask Gus#br#
where exactly the refugees are residing.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The aged, women, and children are sheltered in Lady Wendela's house.#br#
Lady Wendela is probably there tending to them now.#br#
You can find them near the entrance to Navea."#M135010$Gus$821$1#|
15772|#&7$%n%##br#
You should take Gus up on his suggestion#br#
and talk with the refugees at Lady Wendela's place in Navea before you head over to the marsh.#br#

15773|#&7$%n%##br#
The commander in Emerald Marsh is Victoria.#br#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Ah, it's you, %n%. You've finally come."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

"We've managed to halt the demons' attack.#br#
Emerald Town is safe for now."#npc$$829$1#

escaped from the demons' clutches and made it back to Emerald Town."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Unfortunately, we don't have any clues yet... This poor chap, Slim Sye, is covered with wounds.#br#
He can't even talk properly. We don't know for certain whether or not he'll survive."#br#
He says to you with an expression of concern.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"While Victoria is still in her meeting, why don't you come and do me a favor.#br#
We're short of resources in Emerald Town and need to prepare some more military supplies."#npc$$821$1#|

"Hold on. Let me see what you have to do now."#br#
Quentin puts away the manes and pulls out a letter.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Quentin##br#
"Hahaha! At least I'm not the only one who's going to suffer!#br#
That brat Tiffany is always giving me a hard time, so it's no better than she deserves."#br#
Quentin breaks into hearty laughter, gloating over Tiffany's misfortune.#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Quentin##br#
"Erm, I mean, I didn't say anything! You didn't hear a word!"#br#
After noticing your look, Quentin covers his mouth and looks at you nervously.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look at Quentin with one eyebrow raised#br#
before nodding to collude that you ain't heard nothin'.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Quentin##br#
"All right! Your next task is to catch the Platoon Eagle.#br#
Of course, you won't be bare-handed. Use this to catch it."#br#
Quentin takes out a Cloth Bag.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Quentin##br#
"The Platoon Eagle is in Starfragment Field, which is northeast of here.#br#
There are numerous stones in that area. You're sure to recognize it.#br#
Use the Cloth Bag to capture the Platoon Eagle and give it to Tiffany. She is responsible for looking after the Platoon Eagle."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Quentin##br#
"Off you go. If you want to complete your training, you'd better hurry up.#br#
I want to see the expression on Tiffany's face... I mean, I want to see your stellar performance!"#npc$$824$1#|
15822|#&7$Tiffany##br#
"Are you the Envoy of Gaia that Aquila mentioned in her letter?#br#
Aquila wants you to capture the Platoon Eagle, right?#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You take out the Cloth Bag to show that you still haven't caught it.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Tiffany##br#
"If you don't catch the Platoon Eagle, then I can't tell you what to do next.#br#
Use the Cloth Bag to capture the Platoon Eagle if you want to complete this training exercise."#npc$$821$1#|
15823|#&7$Tiffany##br#
"You're quick, Envoy of Gaia."#br#
Tiffany takes the Cloth Bag from you.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tiffany##br#
Tiffany opens the Cloth Bag and inspects the condition of the eagle.#br#
After inspecting, Tiffany sets the Platoon Eagle free.#br#
The Platoon Eagle pecks Tiffany on the hand and flies into the sky.#npc$$1$1#|
15824|After reading Aquila's letter, Quentin cackles and tells you about the next training exercise.

You will need to head northwest to Starfragment Field, use the Cloth Bag to capture the Platoon Eagle, and then give the eagle to Tiffany.|
15831|#&7$Tiffany##br#
"Your performance was excellent. The Platoon Eagle's feathers were barely ruffled."#br#
Tiffany looks at you with barely-concealed admiration.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You thank Tiffany for her praise and assert that it was no big deal.#char$$822$0#

#&7$Tiffany##br#
"It seems that the rumors were true.#br#
Maybe you can change Aquila's opinion of you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You're itching to ask whether Aquila dislikes you or not.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Tiffany##br#
"Hmm... it's not you that she has a problem with you, it's more...#br#
something in her past#br#
that's made her wary of 'fabled heroes.'#br#
I wasn't in the platoon back then, though, so I'm not too sure of the details."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tiffany##br#
"Oh, yeah. Aquila hates it when people talk about her behind her back.#br#
Don't go asking around. If Aquila hears about it... you'll regret it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod to show that you won't ask the other Aquila Platoon members.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Tiffany##br#
"Just as well. More training would be of no use to you.#br#
Head directly to Aquila and tell her that I sent you back."#npc$$821$1#|
15832|...|
15833|#&7$Aquila##br#
"What? You're back earlier than I expected."#br#
Aquila looks at you with surprise.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You relay what Tiffany told you.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Tiffany sent you back?#br#
I thought it was Quentin!"#br#
Aquila seems even more surprised.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"It looks like you're more competent that I expected#br#
if you've earned even Tiffany's recognition so easily.#br#
Tiffany is the pride of the platoon.#br#
She's no easy girl to persuade!"#npc$$821$1#|
15834|Tiffany thinks wonders of your performance and decides to end your training early.

Head back to camp to find Aquila.|
15841|#&7$Aquila##br#
"You were a little fast, but if Tiffany says#br#
additional training would be in vain,#br#
you may prepare for the final test!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look confused and ask what she means by the final test.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Heh... you'll know when the time comes.#br#
First, go and prepare. It will be quite the challenge.#br#
You won't pass automatically just because you're an Envoy of Gaia.#br#
You might even lose your life!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"I'm not just trying to scare you.#br#
Go and prepare. When you're ready, you can come and find me..."#br#
You hear a racket in the distance that cuts Aquila short.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
Aquila looks into the distance with knitted brows. All that can be seen is three people gathered around a bulletin board.#br#
"What are those brats making such a ruckus about? Go and see.#br#
If it's something trivial,#br#
give them a proper cuffing and shut them up!"#npc$$826$1#|
15842|...|
15843|#&7$Mirabelle Clerk##br#
"That group over there is arguing quite fiercely. What do we do?"#M002060$Mirabelle Clerk$828$1#

#&7$Dio##br#
"Bah, it's no big deal.#br#
They argue every day, so it's not exactly a rare thing.#br#
You get used to it."#M050051s85h+70$Dio$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You greet Dio and ask what the two people are arguing about.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Dio##br#
"Why, one of the Mirabelle quests, of course!"#br#
Hm? Wait! You're that %n%!"#br#
Dio looks at %p% carefully before turning to you, having understood.#M050051$Dio$823$1#

#&7$Dio##br#
"When did you come to the platoon?#br#
This is the first time that I've seen an Envoy of Gaia in the flesh!"#br#
Dio is curious and inspects you from all sides, then stands staring at your nose.#M050051$Dio$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You're curious to know what it is about a Mirabelle quest that has made the two of them get into such a big argument.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Mirabelle Clerk##br#
"Hello, %n%.#br#
I'm a clerk here sent by the Mirabelle Association.#br#
Allow me to show you around."#M002060$Mirabelle Clerk$822$1#

#&7$Mirabelle Clerk##br#
"This is the bulletin board we use to assign urgent quests.#br#
The requests come from people and organizations all over the world.#br#
They need someone capable to help them.#br#
A reward will be given to whomever completes the quest."#M002060$Mirabelle Clerk$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle Clerk##br#
"You don't understand?#br#
Why don't you give it a try?#br#
I have just the quest for you!"#M002060$Mirabelle Clerk$824$1#|
15844|Aquila asks you to get ready for the final trial, but there's a commotion all of a sudden, which makes Aquila change her mind. She wants you to check things out first.

Go to Dio and find out what the commotion is about.|
15851|#&7$Aquila##br#
You handled the Mirabelle quest easily, but before you could have time to feel good about yourself, you notice that the arguing has escalated between the two by the bulletin board.#br#
Just when you are about to do something about it, you notice that Aquila is coming this way angrily.#M104040$Aquila$101$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Break it up already, you two!"#br#
I really don't understand what you two are fighting about all day, every day!#br#
I'm warning you - one more time and you two are expelled from the Aquila Platoon!"#M104040$Aquila$826$1#

#&7$Dio##br#
"C-come on, Boss, give 'em a break..."#br#
Dio wants to ease up the situation, but he gets interrupted by an extremely angry Aquila.#M050051s85h+70$Dio$823$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"I've had enough! I'm going to teach those two a lesson... today!"#M104040$Aquila$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You find yourself in an awkward situation,#br#
but then notice Analisa waving at you from a short ways off.#br#
OK, that's your cue!#br#
You high-tail it out of there and go to Analisa.#char$$1$0#|
15852|...|
15853|#&7$Analisa##br#
"Long time no see, %n%."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You smile at Analisa and ask her why she's here.#char$$822$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"I hear that you're about to have your final trial. Are you nervous?"#br#
Analisa doesn't answer your question, instead, throwing one right back at you.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Analisa that you are indeed nervous because you have no idea what the final trial will be.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Anelace##br#
"Well, here's the answer to YOUR question.#br#
I came here to help you pass the final trial!"#npc$$821$1#|
15854|Dio explains the Mirabelle Bulletin Board to you before Aquila shows up in anger and scolds the two who've been arguing.

You go talk to Analisa.|
15861|#&7$Analisa##br#
"Good euipment plays an important role in winning a battle,#br#
so I want you to learn refining from me."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod your head and tell Analisa you'd very much like to learn refining.#char$$821$0#|
15862|...|
15863|#&7$Analisa##br#
"Refining is a process that allows you to forge powerful gear using ores and alloys."#br#
#npc$$821$1##T0001#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"First, you need to learn recipes.#br#
Let's start with trophies."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Please choose the recipe for Selenium Core from the list."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"The instructions on the right will tell you what materials you need.#br#
Place the #&52$Brilliant Alloy#and#&52$ and the Moon Fragment #there,#br#
and then click the#&52$Craft button to make a Selenium Core."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
Refining Cores give equipment extra stats. These stats are unique and random."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Now, learn the recipe for #&52$Lunar Pollen and fuse the Moon Fragment and the Magical Pollen#br#
to make an orange-quality trophy!"#npc$$821$1#|
15864|Analisa comes to Starcrescent Valley to teach you the art of refining.

Talk to Analisa and learn how to refine equipment.|
15871|#&7$Analisa##br#
"Refining can also be applied to weapons.#br#
Secret Stones can further boost the stats of your refined weapon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
What Analisa said catches your attention, so you ask her the details about Secret Stones.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"I'm not really an expert on that.#br#
Why don't you go ask Kai? I'm sure he'll tell you everything about Secret Stones."#npc$$822$1#|
15872|...|
15873|#&7$%n%##br#
After a short greeting,#br#
you ask Kai about Secret Stones.#br#
%p% seems to be interested, too.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Kai##br#
"It's an honor to help a hero like you get cozy with Secret Stones!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Kai##br#
Only one Secret Stone can be inlaid onto a piece of equipment.#br#
The Secret Stone Merchant will help you with the actual inlaying and extraction processes.#npc$$821$1##&V0002#

#&7$Kai##br#
Secret Stones can be upgraded, but keep in mind that the level of the Secret Stones cannot exceed your character level!"#npc$$821$1##&V0003#

#&7$Kai##br#
"Hm? You're also interested in Secret Stones?#br#
Alright, I guess I can tell you some more tricks of the trade."#br#
Kai looks at %p%.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Me? Are you talking to me?"#pet$$821$0#

#&7$Kai##br#
"Yes, I am, and I want to remind you of a few things.#br#
Once a Secret Stone is upgraded, you can longer trade it.#br#
The same rule goes for equipment that's been inlaid WITH Secret Stones.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kai##br#
Such equipment also can't be stored in the warehouse.#br#
Never forget that!#pet$$821$0#

#&7$Kai##br#"Well, that's about it!"#npc$$824$1#|
15874|Secret Stones can further boost the stats of your weapons and equipment. Analisa tells you to talk to Kai for more information.

Go to Kai and ask him about Secret Stones.|
15881|#&7$Kai##br#
"That was pretty much everything I know about Secret Stones. Do you have any other questions?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell him he's told you everything you want to know,#br#
but then you suddenly hear someone fighting.#char$$821$0#

#&7$%p%##br#
%p% has also noticed the commotion and looks at you.#br#
"The ruckus seems to be coming from where we left Aquila."#pet$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You feel surprised that someone would dare get into a fight with the Platoon Leader,#br#
so you decide to check things out."#char$$1$0#|
15882|...|
15883|#&7$Aquila##br#
You see Aquila wrestling someone to the ground from afar.#br#
You approach and ask her what happened.#npc$$2011$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Oh, it's you! I believe this belongs to you?"#br#
Aquila throws something at you as she speaks.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You catch it and take a closer look.#br#
It turns out to be, to your surprise, the weapon Harvey crafted for you in the Demarech Mines!#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"I believe it was stolen when you first got here.#br#
I've gotta give it to that thief - staying here for this long without getting caught!#br#
That and the sheer fact that he was able to steal from an Envoy of Gaia!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Thief##br#
"HA! I'm the number-one thief in the world! Well, the number-one thief's prodigy, at least!#br#
But still, you only caught me because I was too hungry.#br#
I ended up feeling sorry for you guys not having anything to eat here!"#M101050$Thief$824$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
Aquila punches the thief to shut him up.#br#
"That big mouth... he does seem to have impressive skills, though...#br#
Why don't you join the Aquila Platoon?"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"As if! You guys are so poor, I'd die of starvation a week in!#br#
This was the wrong answer, apparently. It rewards him another punch from Aquila.#M101050$Thief$823$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Tell me your answer again!"#br#
Aquila stomps on the thief's back as she speaks.#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Thief##br#
"All right, all right! I'm in! Just stop already!"#M101050$Thief$827$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Hmph, I guess you're not that stupid after all!"#br#
Aquila lets go of the thief, and some of the Platoon members drag the thief away.#npc$$821$1#|
15884|You hear people fighting and wonder what's going on.

Go find Aquila and see what's the matter.|
15891|#&7$Aquila##br#
"I take it you're all set?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod your head and tell Aquila you're ready for the final trial.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Not yet, I'm afraid. Before you face the final trial, you have to learn how to use a secondary weapon first!"#br#
|
15892|...|
15893|#&7$%n%##br#
This is the first time you've ever heard of this "secondary weapon" thing. You feel confused.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Why do you think the Grand Bishop sent you here?#br#
It's to learn about secondary weapons, you blighted fool!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Let's cut to the chase. Just pick a secondary weapon you'd like to learn about.#br#
I don't have all day."#npc$$821$1#|
15894|Before taking on the final trial, you must learn how to use a secondary weapon.

Continue talking with Aquila.|
15901|#&7$Aquila##br#
"There's a cave in the northeast called the Cave of Trials.#br#
The final trial we've been talking about will require you to enter that cave.#br#
The rule is simple - get out of there safe and sound to pass the trial."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"This doesn't, however, mean the trial will be easy.#br#
I don't mean to scare you,#br#
but those who've failed the trial have either gone insane or died."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You promise Aquila that you will take the trial very seriously and do your best.#char$$821$0##&PP02001#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"One last reminder - the advantage you hold over others is your Eidolon.#br#
Whenever you face a tough enemy,#br#
don't forget to use your Eidolon's combo skills."#br#
|
15902|#&7$Aquila##br#
"Why are you still here? Did you forget where the cave is?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"The Cave of Trials is buried in the face of the mountain to the northeast.#br#
Just enter the cave and get out safely. That's all you must do to pass the trial.#br#
Now go, and good luck!"#npc$$821$1#|
15903|#&7$Aquila##br#
"Why the sour face? You should be happy, right? You've passed the final trial!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Aquila that you met the Shadow Knight's troops in the Cave of Trials!#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Oh, so that's why you look so worried. Relax!#br#
They weren't real. You only saw them because of your fear."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Lingering power from the Cube of Gaia flows throughout the Cave of Trials.#br#
Unfortunately, it's not enough to actually be useful."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"People found out, however, that the power turned people's fear into vivid images in front of their eyes.#br#
The Grand Bishop heard about it and sealed the cave.#br#
Today, we use the Cave of Trials to train people in order to fight against the Shadow Knight."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Only those who overcome their own worst nightmares are truly strong.#br#
That's why I sent you to the Cave of Trials."#npc$$821$1#|
15904|Aquila explains the final trial to you.

Head to the Cave of Trials and pass the trial.|
15911|#&7$%n%##br#
Aquila's explanation didn't quite convince you,#br#
so you further break down exactly what happened in the Cave of Trials.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Are you telling me that you'd never seen these people before?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Aquila that you are positive about that.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"That's odd. You should only be able to see people you've met in the past..."#br#
Aquila frowns. Apparently she cannot understand what's happened either.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"So what you saw in the cave could be... completely real?!"#npc$$823$1#|
15912|...|
15913|#&7$Aquila##br#
"What you saw in the cave must have been real!#br#
You ran into real troops of the Shadow Knight."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You would never have expected that even the Aquila Platoon would no longer be safe. You ask Aquila what you should do.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Don't worry too much. I'm sending more people there.#br#
Next time they show up, they won't escape with their lives!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"As for you... I'd say you should return to Navea for now.#br#
I've taught you everything I know. The rest is up to you."#npc$$821$1##&PP02002#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"But if you'd like more training, I suggest you find some dungeons to run.#br#
You might even get some nice items from monster drops."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Aquila Platoon Member##br#
"Tell me about it! Last time we raided Ozymand Temple, I got some smokin' Battle Bows!#br#
Too bad no one in the Platoon uses bows, so the Platoon Leader had to sell them.#br#
But extra money never hurts. We got several nice meals outta that one, so no complaints here!"#M124020$Aquila Platoon Member$821$1#

"No! Not you again!#br#

"Dio, what's going on here?"#npc$$827$0#

#&7$Dio##br#
"The Grand Bishop sent this Ostrich here and would like %n% to have it after their training is over.#br#
The Ostrich's been wandering around ever since it got here. Turns out it's looking for %n%!"#M050051$Dio$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You apologize to Dio for Beebis's behavior
and explain that in order to focus on training, you'd left Beebis in Navea.#br#
This is the first time you and Beebis have been separated for so long, which is no doubt why Beebis got a little out of control.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Hmm... I see. Take the Ostrich with you when you leave then."#npc$$821$1#|
15914|The Shadow Knight's crew shows up in the Cave of Trials. Things are worse than you ever expected!

Aquila looks a little bit surprised.#npc$$821$1#

You ask Aquila if something is wrong.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Aquila##br#
"Well, THAT man also chose this one... a long, long time ago...#br#
Oh, nothing. I was just mumbling."#npc$$821$1#

 who seems to be calling out your name as well.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Byron##br#
"%n%, wait!"#M207010s75h-10$Byron$101$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You see a young man coming towards you, riding an ostrich.#br#
 You immediately recognize Byron,#br#
@apprentice of Analisa the Templar Blacksmith.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Byron##br#
"I... I finally found you, %n%!"#br#
The sprinting ostrich suddenly stopped short in front of you, causing Byron to nearly fall off. #br#
 Looks like riding an ostrich is a big challenge for him after all. #M207010$Byron$2$1#

#&7$Byron##br#
"Lady Analisa wants me to tell you#br#
to bring the weapon Mr. Harvey made for you, #br#
and look for her in Navea."#M207010$Byron$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 The fact that Analisa wants to have a look at your weapon out of the blue #br#
 has caught you by surprise.#br#
You ask Byron if he knows why.#&7$Byron##br#
"Well, Lady Analisa didn't tell me anything.#br#
 I'm pretty sure Lady Analisa wants to explain to you in person." #M207010$Byron$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod and assure him that you'll look for Analisa as soon as possible.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Byron##br#
"All right, I'll report back to Lady Analisa.#br#
 It's agonizingly painful riding an ostrich...#br#
 Hopefully the return journey will be better..."#br#
 Byron holds the reins in resignation and rides off on his ostrich. #M207010$Byron$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
As you watch Byron waggle off on his ostrich, #br#
the bird begins to sprint before Byron is even seated properly. #br#
 It looks like Byron won't be having a smooth journey anytime soon.#clean$1#|
17053|#&7$%n%##br#
@You greet Analisa #br#
@and ask her if everything's all right.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"You're here at last, %n%. #br#
I was wondering if you got the news."#npc$1$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Could you let me have a look at it?#br#
The weapon that my teacher Harvey forged specially for you,"#br#
Analisa seems earnest.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod and pass the weapon to Analisa.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"This weapon really looks amazing... There's no doubting his craftsmanship.#br#
 As his apprentice, I'm very motivated now #br#
 to forge weapons that surpass his masterpieces."#br#
 Analisa marvels at Harvey's weapon as she examined it.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Looking at the condition of the weapon, I can tell you really treasured it.#br#
 I'm sure if Harvey knew about this, he'd be very happy."#br#
 Analisa smiles, #br#
 as if she is recalling memories of her time spent with Harvey.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"You might not have known that this miracle weapon #br#
is actually one of Harvey's greatest masterpieces."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You are caught by surprise by what Analisa said, #br#
 but you continued to listen.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"When Harvey was initially forging this weapon, #br#
 he did not imbue too much power in it,#br#
 as he was worried that you would be unable to wield it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"After hearing about your heroics in the war, #br#
he believes that you're ready to handle greater powers.#br#
 So he wrote me a letter to assist you with forging your weapon to its maximum potential."#npc$$1$1#|
17061|#&7$Analisa##br#
"Historically, there have been many heroic characters #br#
 who have carried formidable weapons with incredible powers.#br#
 We call these miracle weapons,"#br#
 Analisa takes a serious tone.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You feel perplexed#br#
 that although your weapon has remarkable powers,#br#
the powers are not as incredible as Analisa claims. #char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"You seem to have a lot of questions on your mind."#br#
 Analisa smiles at you and continues to explain.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"A miracle weapon is like a vessel.#br#
 The powers you are experiencing now are not at their maximum potential.#br#
 However, we can imbue additional power into it to increase its might."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"%n%, since you participated in the Makar Arena once, #br#
you should know the most important steps for making a weapon, right?"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"Could it be the same as when you went to visit Adonis to obtain the Rapid Breath of Flame,#br#
 and imbued it into the weapon?"#br#
%p% asks Analisa directly.#pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You recall what you learned in the arena battle on Ventos Prairie, #br#
 that one of the most important steps when forging a weapon,#br#
was Adonis' blessing ritual.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"It's almost the same, #br#
but the powers to be imbued are slightly different,"#br#
Analisa speaks in a secretive tone.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Depending on the wielder, #br#
the powers to be imbued will vary. The powers of the Eidolons are naturally the most suitable powers to be used by the Envoy of Gaia."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"Transforming the power of Eidolons into a battle aura#br#
 can greatly enhance the powers of the weapon, once imbued."#br#
@As Analisa explains,#br#
@she carefully places your weapon in a box and seals it.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"I must collect the materials for fortification as soon as possible. #br#
 Please hand the weapon to Byron for safekeeping."#br#
Analisa passes the box to you.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"The weapon must not be damaged before we imbue the Rapid Flame War Breath into it.#br#
 So please use other weapons while I work on the miracle weapon."#br#
 Analisa speaks firmly.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"I don't have much time, #br#
so I need to go. #br#
My assistant will explain the rest."#npc$$1$1#|
17063|#&7$%n%##br#
You hand Byron the weapon,#br#
 and relate Analisa's message to him.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Byron##br#
"Analisa told me to take good care of this weapon,#br#
 and deliver it to Lord Harvey immediately."#br#
Byron takes the box with care,#br#
 as if the content is fragile.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Byron##br#
"Before fortifying the weapon,#br#
 it'll have to be delivered to Lord Harvey for examination."#br#
Byron put the box aside as he explained further.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Byron##br#
"To increase the weapon's power, #br#
@the most direct way is to increase its sharpness and toughness.#br#
 Once these two attributes are enhanced, the weapon's power will increase tremendously."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Byron##br#
"To forge a powerful Miracle Weapon, only the best materials are required.#br#
@Apart from the fortification metals Lady Analisa is collecting, #br#
 the aura to be imbued is also very important."#npc$$1$1#|
17071|#&7$Byron##br#
"Lady Analisa believes that #br#
the ideal aura for transforming the weapon into something truly lethal, #br#
 can be obtained from Zaahir the Immemorial Beast in Infernal Abyss."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Byron##br#
"The raging fires there burn all year round, #br#
 with ferocity that can incinerate their enemies into ashes.#br#
 Lady Analisa hopes that you can go and search for it."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You nod, #br#
 asking how to collect the Eidolon's aura. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Byron##br#
"Lady Analisa asked me to hand you this."#br#
@Byron takes out a glowing light orb,#br#
 and hands it to you carefully.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Byron##br#
"This light orb can store powers in the surrounding area.#br#
 You must visit Level 20 of the Infernal Abyss, #br#
 and activate the light orb to collect the Infernal War Breath."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Byron##br#
"Once you've obtained the Infernal War Breath,#br#
@look for Lady Dan on Starstruck Plateau.#br#
 She's the only person who can transform the powers of the Infernal War Breath#br#
 into battle aura for imbuing into the weapon."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 You were slightly amazed #br#
 that Mage Dan not only specializes in decoding ancient magical inscriptions, #br#
@but is also adept in working with the power of the Eidolons.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Byron##br#
"Once you're ready, #br#
 please proceed to the Infernal Abyss in Ventos Prairie.#br#
 Lady Analisa wants this to be accomplished as soon as possible."#npc$$821$1#|
17073|#&7$%n%##br#
@You hand the Infernal War Breath to Dan,#br#
 and told her you were here on Analisa's request.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Dan##br#
"Thanks for coming!#br#
@I'm so caught up with my work here,#br#
 that I couldn't find time to meet you."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"Still, since enhancing the weapon is of utmost importance,#br#
 I want to do my part,#br#
 to assist you in acquiring the powers that you deserve."#br#
 Dan takes the light orb filled with the Infernal War Breath from you.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"This is an amazingly powerful aura. #br#
I must thank my stars for having this chance to handle such power."#br#
 Dan bemoans while gazing at the light orb.#npc$$825$1#|
17074|Analisa believes that the Eidolon's aura for strengthening your weapon can be found at Level 20 of the Infernal Abyss. Once you have obtained the Infernal War Breath, head to Starstruck Plateau to look for Dan.

*Complete the Infernal Abyss challenge (Five-man mode). Obtain the Infernal War Breath at level 20 of Infernal Abyss using the light orb and return to Starstruck Plateau to meet Dan.|
17081|#&7$%n%##br#
You questioned Dan on the whereabouts of the Shadow Knight,#br#
 and if there's any updates from the Magic Division on their surveillance operation.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Dan##br#
"Presently we don't know his exact location, #br#
@but we have discovered a few things."#br#
 Dan suddenly looks serious and solemn.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
The Shadow Knight thinks that a certain power is required to revive his wife. #br#
 Based on his earlier actions, we believe he is looking for a pure and Divine Power."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"If we can identify where such powers are located, #br#
 we'd have a good chance of tracing the Shadow Knight's whereabouts."#br#
 Dan deduces.#npc$$1$1#|
17083|#&7$Dan##br#
"The next step, which is also the most important procedure,#br#
 is to transform the Infernal War Breath into aura for imbuing into the weapon."#br#
 Dan lifts up the light orb and starts chanting an ancient incantation.#npc$$311$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
 All of a sudden, a miraculous power begins to surround Dan,#br#
@emitting an ancient aura#br#
 that resonates with the Infernal War Breath.#npc$$311$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
@At the moment when Dan finishes her incantations, #br#
@both powers have been fused completely.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"The power of the Eidolons is indeed extraordinary. #br#
 The transformed aura is like a ravaging flame, #br#
 that carries the massive force of destruction."#br#
 Dan looks satisfied with the outcome of the aura transformation.#npc$$825$1#|
17084|As Dan is busy with her work, she requests that you look for her in Starstruck Plateau instead, so she can transform the Infernal War Breath.

Talk to Dan.|
17091|#&7$Dan##br#
"Besides the aura from the Infernal Abyss,#br#
 you will also need to acquire the powers of Nazrudin in Whirlpool Abyss."#br#
 Dan handed the transformed aura to you.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"The entrance of Whirlpool Abyss is located on the Helonia Coast,#br#
 and is guarded by Nazrudin's missionaries.#br#
 I believe you are already familiar with this."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"Defeat Nazrudin at level 15 of Whirlpool Abyss, #br#
@to acquire the Whirlpool War Breath. #br#
 Unlike the Infernal War Breath, this power is pure and subtle." #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"These two powers complement each other.#br#
 The Infernal War Breath enhances the weapon's sharpness, #br#
@whereas the Whirlpool War Breath enhances its toughness." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"In order to attain the status of Miracle Weapon, #br#
@both powers must be present."#br#
 Dan explains fervently to you the importance of the two powers. #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"Byron has news for you.#br#
@Lord Harvey has finished altering your weapon, #br#
 and wants you to meet him at Demarech Mines."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"Once you acquire the Whirlpool War Breath and your weapon, #br#
 you must return to Navea immediately. #br#
 Analisa will be expecting you."#npc$$821$1#|
17093|#&7$%n%##br#
@You took out the Infernal War Breath, Whirlpool War Breath, #br#
 and the altered weapon, handing them to Analisa. #char$$821$0#

"Thank you, %n%. #br#
 I will forge the weapon befitting of its power."#npc$$821$1#|
17094|In addition to the Infernal War Breath, the Whirlpool War Breath is also needed. Dan requests that you to defeat Nazrudin at level 15 of the Whirlpool Abyss to obtain the Whirlpool War Breath, retrieve the weapon from Harvey in Demarech Mines and hand them to Analisa in the City of Navea.

Defeat Nazrudin at level 15 in Whirlpool Abyss to obtain the Whirlpool War Breath. Then head to Demarech Mines and retrieve the weapon from Harvey. Finally, return to the City of Navea and look for Analisa.|

"You have arrived, %n%.#br#

"However, it is time for it to evolve#br#

"I really want to finish your miracle weapon as soon as possible, #br#

"Even if I start to work on it now, #br#
@I'm not confident I'll complete it before your battle with the Shadow Knight. #br#
 Still, trust me that I'll be doing my best."#npc$$1$1#

You tell Analisa that you trust her skill, #br#
 and you are confident that the enhanced weapon will strengthen your abilities. #char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"As long as the weapon complements its wielder, #br#
 as a blacksmith, I consider that an achievement."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Analisa##br#
"While waiting for your weapon, #br#
 you should undergo more training, #br#
 so as to strengthen yourself."#npc$$821$1#

"I don't want to end up seeing that the weapon that I forge#br#
 is even more powerful than you."#br#
@Analisa says jokingly.

"Well, I don't know much about that. #br#
 Maybe after you've completed your training, #br#

"It's like this, you see#br#

"Our tracking magic has identified his location. #br#
 He is heading towards a place filled with Holy Power,#br#
 and he's moving faster than we've expected."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I'm afraid that before we've pinpointed the Shadow Knight's exact location, #br#
 he would have acquired the powers he desires."#br#

@You, meanwhile, know that it's not the end yet.#npc$$1001$1#

You suddenly felt an unknown pressure,#br#
 a feeling the same as how you felt in the dream.#br#
 The pressure that makes you suffocate.#char$$501$0#|
17141|#&7$%n%##br#
 You ask the woman if she was the Shadow Knight's wife.#char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Luciana##br#
"Yes. My name is Luciana. #br#
@Reinhardt...the Shadow Knight, is my husband."#npc$$822$1#

 and are surprised to learn that she's an angel. #char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Luciana##br#
"I don't have much time. I have to go."#br#
 Luciana has a gentle and assuaging voice.#npc$$1$1#

"Although my husband went against the Church for my sake,#br#
 he had never wanted to destroy the world.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Luciana##br#
"In order to revive me, he tried many different methods,#br#
 and accidentally opened the Pandemonium Rift.#br#
 That was how he got bewitched by the Pandemonium and gradually lost himself..."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Luciana##br#
"You must defeat Reinhardt."#br#
 Luciana sounds distressed, but determined.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Luciana##br#
"If he's allowed to continue, #br#
 he will eventually lose himself completely,#br#
 and become nothing more than a minion of the Pandemonium."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Luciana##br#
"As his wife, it is heart-breaking to see my husband in that state. #br#
Please defeat him and save the world."#br#You are moved by Luciana's sincere love towards her husband.#npc$$822$1#

You tell Luciana that you're already dead.#br#
@You failed to defeat the Shadow Knight.#br#
 Maybe you're not the one after all. #char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Luciana##br#
"Fret not. Someone will come to save you. #br#
 You are the hope of this world, the Scion of Fate."#npc$$821$1#

"There were rumors of a holy sword and particular sword skills,#br#
 possessed by the First Templar Leader.#br#

#&7$Imma##br#
"Actually... Bishop Belenus has already made up his mind... #br#
 to sacrifice himself when the people are in danger..."#br#
 Imma speaks regretfully.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Imma##br#
"The family of the First Templar Leader#br#
 emigrated to many different places after the leader passed away. #br#
 They won't accept any help from the Church, nor reveal their whereabouts." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Imma##br#
"Unfortunately, I know so little about their situation.#br#
 You'll have to search for answers yourself." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Imma##br#
"I truly hope you can find the holy sword #br#
 and learn its skills, #br#
 so that we will not be powerless#br#
 when fighting the demons.#npc$$821$1#

and tell the Pope that you'll do your best to find them#br#
 and return with the holy sword.#char$$821$0#

"A while ago, we received pollution readings from Rarnor Falls. Fenrich, our resident ecologist, is looking into the matter. The Village Chief is pressing him to work every day until the issue is figured out."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Junior##br#
"According to Fenrich's latest report, the pollution around Rarnor Falls is getting worse. In order to preserve the ecology of the forest, we must destroy the contaminated animals."#npc$$2$1#

"It's a terrible job, but if you're willing to do it, I'm sure the Village Chief will give you a hefty reward."#npc$$822$1#|

"I feel bad about bothering you with this, %n%. However, we look to you as not only our hero, but as a resident of Brevis. As such, you have a duty to help this village like the rest of us."#br##br#
#&53$Alain chuckles weakly.##npcs85h+70$$825$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"If we all work hard and don't relent, everything will return to normal one day."#br##br#

#&7$Junior##br#
"The Mechanics gripe about there not being enough Waterlight Mushrooms for their work, while the ecologists whine about needing more Butterfly Fairy Eggs to raise..."#br##br#
#&53$Junior sighs, clearly agitated.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Junior##br#
"Now, because of Augustus' research on Halo Energy, that has suddenly become a valuable commodity that we just don't have enough of."#br##br#
#&53$Junior shakes his head.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Junior##br#
"With our current lack of dwarfpower, meeting all of these requests is next to impossible. Could you perhaps lighten the load a little with this collection task?"#npc$$2$1#|

"Great! Thanks for your hard work."#br##br#
#&53$Alain seems pleased as he examines the items.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"I'm glad you're here to help us. It gave me enough breathing room to hire more guards. I don't know how I can handle all of these requests otherwise."#npc$$825$1#

"Here, take this. I'll probably be seeking your help again sometime in the future."#br##br#

"More and more creatures keep appearing from the Demarech Pool. All of the Investigation Team's resources are being wasted dealing with them..."#br##br#
#&53$Chelsea sighs with frustration.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"Tomitsa is currently undergoing renovations, so keeping the road to the Mines clear is very important. However, the creatures that the Shadow Knight created are blocking the road. The Miners are saying that it takes too much time to go around them."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"The Investigation Team leader is trying to solve the village's problems, but the team is stretched pretty thin because most of them are out dealing with those monsters."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"If I recall, you've battled these Demarech Pool creatures before. You'll probably be able to take care of these monsters no problem. So, what do you say? Willing to help us out again?"#npc$$822$1#|

#&53$Chelsea glares at the report now crumpled in her hand.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"There is a high demand for Miracle Stones, so those greedy Marauders keep raiding the Demarech Mines district. They're crazed, as though money has become more important than their own lives!"#br##br#
#&53$Chelsea sighs with exasperation.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"The Investigation Team is constantly patrolling the place, but that just isn't enough to stop the Marauders from taking Miracle Stones. Even worse, miners from the village are getting attacked by them."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"%n%, could you maybe help us patrol the area around the district? You'd probably do a better job scaring them off than we have been."#npc$$821$1#|

"I really need someone to help collect local Spices, Miracle Stones needed for forging and Tools needed by the Miners."#npc$$821$1#

"If you have time, could you collect those things for me?"#npc$$821$1#|
20192|#&7$Victoria##br#
"It'll be tough finding Spice Trees outside of town. Getting excavation tools and extracting Miracle Stones will be even more of a pain. Gathering these things will be dangerous, so remember to be careful."#npc$$821$1#|

#&7$Bloom##br#
"These creatures think they can just disrupt peace in the Highlands and get away with it. They're already stirring up trouble between the Hunters and Stone Hammer Tribe. While the Village Chief and the Tribe Chief try to hash things out, the Cult's forces are expanding. This needs to stop!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bloom##br#
"You defeated these guys once before, if I remember right. If you could help us smother their army before it gets off the ground, that would be fantastic."#npc$$824$1#

"The village really needs to restock on supplies. I wish the villagers knew how difficult gathering can actually be."#br##br#
#&53$Bloom stretches and sighs.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Bloom##br#
"Since the battle between the Hunters and the Argus Cult started, those normally tasked to gather supplies have been ambushed by those Avians. Of course the Village Chief doesn't want this to continue, so the collection duties have been reassigned to some of the Hunters."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bloom##br#
"Even so, we still need people to help in collecting Toucant Eggs found outside of the village, tree branches from the forest north of the Stone Hammer Tribe and Hollow Amaranth that we need for so many things. The village cannot function without these basic necessities."#npc$$821$1#

"Perhaps you'd like to assist us again? I can't see this task being too difficult for someone like you."#npc$$824$1#|
20252|#&7$Jeffery##br#
"...until the last minute. Candetton needs to use its own resources to solve its problems. We must protect our home! That's the only way things will improve around here."#npc$$828$1#|
20253|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report the results of your task to Jeffery.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"The Scholars claim that purifying the marsh will take more than a day's work. Restoring this place to its original beauty will require help from everyone."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"Here's your reward. I hope you'll continue to help us."#br##br#
#&53$Jeffery hands you the reward.##npc$$822$1#|
20254|Scholars have arrived to help restore the ecology of the marsh. They need Mud Piles to analyze the marsh's condition, Fluorescent River Grass to help filter and clean the marsh, and they need Venom Bug Eggs destroyed so that they won't harm the marsh.|
20261|#&7$Simpson##br#
"Those rebels... They are such fools! Looks like we must put them in their place again."#br##br#
#&53$Simpson looks through the investigation report.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"Most of our soldiers are making preparations to help the Church, so the security of the Ventos Tribe relies on the Imperial Bodyguards. I never thought those Rebels would be stupid enough to try to launch another rebellion."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"With only the Imperial Bodyguards here, maintaining order on the plains is very difficult..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"%n%, we look at you as one of us. Therefore, I am asking you to help us with this crisis."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"Just go out to the Rebel Camp and subdue those remaining idiots."#npc$$822$1#|
20262|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Because of this precarious situation, we've had no choice but to leave the remaining Rebels to the Bodyguards. This cannot be a long-term plan. I must think this through."#npc$$828$1#|
20263|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report the results of your Rebel Camp trip to Leo Ryan.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Great! You always show up right when I need you. I was right about you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"I feel more at ease with you helping the Bodyguards."#br##br#
#&53$Leo gives you a reward.##npc$$822$1#|
20264|According to reports, the Rebels are attempting to regroup for another attack against the Ventos Tribe. Therefore, Leo Ryan has assigned the task of keeping the Rebel Camp under control to the Imperial Bodyguards.|
20271|#&7$Simpson##br#
"When will those annoying Gnomes stop?"#br##br#
#&53$Simpson snarls as he looks through the investigation report.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"According to this, members of the Lion's Roar Army have been attacked by those bothersome creatures! No one has been seriously hurt yet, but if we allow this to continue, that will quickly change."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"%n% I know you have other things to do, but could you spare time to help the Lion's Roar Army guard that area? Remember that as one of us, this is just as much your home as it is ours."#npc$$822$1#|
20272|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"%n%, Simpson has informed me that you are going to Oracle to suppress those Gnomes. Let me know how serious the situation is out there."#npc$$828$1#|
20273|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report the result of your Oracle trip to Leo Ryan.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"I must admit that I'd be rather lost without you."#br##br#
#&53$Leo grins.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Your behavior is proof that forming alliances is worthwhile. As one of us, remember to return here again."#br##br#
#&53$Leo hands you your reward.##npc$$822$1#|
20274|The Gnomes are determined to get revenge against the Makar by attacking frequently. Leo Ryan has tasked the Lion's Roar Army to continue their efforts to suppress the Gnomes at Oracle.|
20281|#&7$Simpson##br#
"We need more resources than I thought! More steps need to be taken if we are to be prepared."#br##br#
#&53$Simpson sighs as he looks through the report.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"When we formed an alliance with the Church, we became officially at war with the Shadow Knight. Makar honor cannot be tarnished by arriving at the battlefield ill-prepared. As such, His Highness has ordered us to ensure we have enough battle supplies."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"Right now, we are short on Stable Wind Grass, Wind Perch Grass and branches from a Tree of the Dead to craft equipment. Also, we need Painkiller Grass to cope with injuries. In summary, we're short a lot of supplies."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"I'm assuming you have a bit of free time. Would you like to help us gather these supplies?"#npc$$825$1#|
20282|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Because we've agreed to enter this war, we cannot fail our brothers-at-arms. We must be fully prepared to assist them in battle."#npc$$821$1#|
20283|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give the gathered supplies to Leo's guard.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"%n%, it warms my heart to see you helping us by bringing back so many supplies. If everyone is as thoughtful as you, the entire kingdom would be much more efficient."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"This is your reward. You deserve it."#br##br#
#&53$Leo places the reward in your hands.##npc$$822$1#|
20284|By allying themselves with the Church, the Makar have undertaken more responsibility as they prepare for war against the Shadow Knight. Being efficient in their preparations is essential, so Leo Ryan has ordered a large quantity of weapons and armor to be made as well as to have medical supplies readily available.|
20291|#&7$Wallace##br#
"Oh no, not again! How are we going to solve this robot problem?"#br##br#
#&53$Wallace releases a deep sigh.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"From the looks of things, a large group of Robot Soldiers are gathering at the Barren Well."#br##br#
#&53$Wallace worriedly stares off into the distance.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"I don't know what they're planning to do, but if it's like before, they'll probably attack the garrison."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"In short, we must ensure the safety of Barren Well. No matter what, we can't lose this important strategic location."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"I'll be blunt; we need your help. Please, can you do so again?"#npc$$822$1#|
20292|#&7$Carrick##br#
"The Barren Well is a very important strategic location. We can't let those Robot Soldiers snatch it from us!"#npc$$827$1#|
20293|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Carrick that the Robot Soldiers have been pushed back for now.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"The abilities of an Envoy of Gaia are unmatched. I should thank my lucky stars you're on our side."##br#
#&53$Carrick chuckles.#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Here is the reward for your efforts. Use it well; we'll need you again later!"#br##br#
#&53$Carrick gives you the reward.##npc$$821$1#|
20294|Sentries at the Barren Well are in danger from Robot Soldiers gathering there. The Commander wants to keep the location secure, so he has ordered the area protected at any cost.|
20301|#&7$Wallace##br#
"We've just received a messenger hailing from Tafay Village; looks like the situation out there is getting pretty bad. I'm sure they could really use the help of someone like you, %n%" #br##br#
#&53$Wallace tries to maintain a calm expression, but you catch a glimpse of embarrassment in his eyes.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"We'd send our own team, of course, but lately...well, we just don't have the resources to help out with Tafay, what with all our available troops either guarding the barren well or the fortress."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"Be that as it may, we can't very well just ignore their situation either. The Tafay farmlands are being ransacked by out-of-control robots and thieving Sasquacks. If we let this slide, they'll fast be out of food and Tafay Village will be no more."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"I'm entrusting you with this task, %n%. Don't let me down. Head to Tafay Village, offer your assistance in their patrols, and save those Dwarves!"#npc$$822$1#|
20302|#&7$Carrick##br#
"Without the advanced Dwarven technology of Tafay Village, we'll never reclaim this wasteland. We must do all that we can to protect Tafay Village from destruction."#npc$$827$1#|
20303|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After returning from your patrol, you meet with Carrick and describe to him what you encountered.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Hmm... You've done well, %n% - interesting findings indeed. We'll never reclaim this land without the assistance of Tafay Village's technological advancements."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"You've done a lot of good out here, I'm glad you're on our side." #br##br#
#&53$Carrick hands you a reward.##npc$$822$1#|
20304|Commander Carrick promised the Dwarves of Tafay that he would help rebuild their village, but they are currently surrounded by dangerous creatures and out-of-control robots. For everyone's sake, and because Carrick's forces are spread thin, you were the prime candidate to assist in helping to patrol Tafay Village.|
20311|#&7$Wallace##br#
"What to do, what to do...so many things that I need to do!"#br##br#
#&53$You approach Wallace as he mutters and paces back and forth.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"Ah, %n%! Perfect timing. I need someone who can help me out around here. Everyone else is up to their eyeballs in work. Can I count on you?"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"Our troops stationed at the Barren Well are awaiting their supplies, but we're undermanned here and behind on our delivery."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"After you've done that, we desperately need to clear a safe path through the Forest of Thorns, otherwise our support crew will have great difficulty making it through in a timely manner."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"Let's see...oh, one more thing! As our soldiers work to reclaim the land, they're rapidly wearing down farm tools. I need you to collect the abandoned ones outside Tafay Village - I think we can reforge them into something usable. That about covers it, %n%. Well...what are you standing around for? Hop to it!"#npc$$821$1#|
20312|#&7$Carrick##br#
"I've already sent word to headquarters that we're undermanned out here, but new recruits are still a long way off. Until they arrive, we've only ourselves to rely on."#npc$$827$1#|
20313|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Having completed your assignments, you report back to Carrick.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Expertly done, %n%! Believe me, I was actually quite embarrassed that you'd have to do these things, but look at me - we're so short on hands that even I'm out working the fields!"#br##br#
#&53$Carrick shows you his callused hands.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Here, take this, I insist. Your work around here is much appreciated." #br##br#
#&53$Carrick hands you a reward.##npc$$822$1$1#|
20314|Due to Nudak Fortress currently being short of hands, you offered your services to Wallace and Carrick. First, you need to deliver some supplies to Squad Leader Walker at the Barren Well. Then, clear a safe path through the Forest of Thorns for future supply crews. Third, collect abandoned farm tools from an old crate outside of Tafay Village so they can be reforged and repaired for use in reclaiming the land.|
20315|#&7$Walker##br#
"I'm sorry we've had to trouble you with these menial tasks, but that's the kind of predicament we're in. Everyone's doing the work of at least 5 men! You have my thanks, %n%." #br##br#
#&53$Walker takes the supply goods from you.##npc$$822$1#|
20321|#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"I've had it up to here with those awful Sand Owl Bandits!" #br##br#
#&53$Ferdinand yells in frustration.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"Once again the Sand Owl Bandits are terrorizing our residents, %n%.But this time, they're going overboard, to the point of random acts of cruelty! Looks like they really want us to suffer."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"Do you think you can lend us a hand to stick it back to them twice as good as they gave? I think they'll be shaking in the boots at the sight of you!"#npc$$825$1#|
20322|#&7$Hayes##br#
"Those Sand Owl Bandits are really getting on my nerves this time. Seems the only way to get them to back off is to hit 'em hard enough that they remember the pain."#npc$$827$1#|
20323|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Hayes that you're sure you put the fear of Gaia into those bandits. They shouldn't dare attack the Oasis again any time soon.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"I certainly hope so. I've invested a lot in recruitment lately, and it'd be nice to not have to worry about the cost of an all-out battle."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"You're our ally, but that doesn't mean great accomplishments should go unrewarded. Take this and treat yourself to something nice." #br##br#
#&53$Hayes hands you a reward.##npc$$826$1#|
20324|After the defeat of their leader, the Sand Owl Bandits have grown increasingly cruel to the residents of Palmgil Oasis. To combat their violence, Hayes began hiring guards and mercenaries to rough them up, hoping to drive them from the desert.|
20331|#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"Dash it all! The expedition team in the Ozymand Temple is under attack again. We've lost enough good fighters out there already." #br##br#
#&53$Ferdinand sighs helplessly.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"Obtaining access to the Ozymand Temple was simple enough, but the monsters roaming around inside are giving us a hell of a time. We tried overpowering them with force, but it just hasn't worked."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"%n%, my friend, I can't imagine anyone stronger than you will come along anytime soon. Will you help us wipe out the monsters roaming around the Ozymand Temple?"#npc$$822$1#|
20332|#&7$Hayes##br#
"I hear you pulled the expedition team out of the fire, eh? No shortage of ambition there, %n%, or skill, for that matter. I envy you! Tell me, how did it all go down?"#npc$$821$1#|
20333|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Hayes that you eradicated as many monsters as you could, yet some still remain.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Well...that's to be expected, I suppose. I was once on a project excavating a crystal temple from an ancient era. It wasn't nearly as bad as our current situation, though."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Your help is much appreciated around here, %n%. You deserve this reward - no, I insist! Good work must be well compensated - that's Business 101, my friend!"#npc$$825$1#|
20334|While exploring the Ozymand Temple, the expedition team was overrun by monsters. Unable to fend off the fiends themselves, Hayes recruited more mercenaries to protect the expedition team from danger.|
20341|#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"It's high time that we started restocking our supplies around here, and we could use the help of anyone who can pitch in."#br##br# #&53$Ferdinand inspects a Moa Egg, then sets it down gently.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"%n%, could you help us out too? Every able-bodied person is out collecting supplies; we're trying to bring back as much as we can to replenish our stocks."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"Here's a list of what we need. First, highly nutritious Moa Eggs, followed by arrows lost in bushes while fending off Sand Owl Bandits. Third, we need Spiderling Eggs which we use to make poisoned arrows."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"Well, that about covers it! Get out there and set an example for the others!"#npc$$825$1#|
20342|#&7$Hayes##br#
"Hoooooh... heeeee... hoo..."#br##br#
#&53$Hayes stands off to the side wheezing, propping himself up against a wall.##npc$$829$1#|
20343|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You hand Hayes the supplies you've collected, even though he is still gasping for breath.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Yech! I can't stand handling these disgusting Spiderling Eggs. I hope I never come face-to-face with an angry Spiderling brood-mother..." #br##br#
#&53$Hayes forces a smile, but you can tell the worry on his face is real.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"Here's your reward, %n%; keep it safe! Oh, and this? It's my part of the reward! I'll also keep it safe, don't you worry about that." #br##br#
#&53$Hayes hands you your reward, while simultaneously putting his own share into his pocket.##npc$$826$1#|
20344|It's time to collect supplies for Palmgil Oasis! Everyone is working hard to obtain useful items to replenish the depleted stocks. You'll be able to earn a decent reward from your assistance in this endeavor.|
20351|#&S00004#
#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Like a chill in the air, you sense evil energy gradually expand, gluttonous. Somehow, you know it's coming from somewhere nearby...Crescent Hill?##char$$827:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Then, as a shifting of the wind, you sense a different kind of energy press itself against the first, as though trying to smother the creeping evil. As the two energies collide, you grow dizzy, the world spinning out of control.##char$$1:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After much deliberation, you decide to follow this energy to seek out its origin.##char$$806:0$0#|
20352|#&7$Barthold##br#
"I don't like the feel of things..." #br##br# 
#&53$The mage shudders, muttering to himself.##npc$$828$1#|
20353|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The mouth of a magic portal yawns before you and, even though you still have absolutely no idea what is really going on, you're certain that it is the source of the evil permeating Crescent Hill...##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Barthold looks increasingly distressed...Could he know what's going on? You decide to question him.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Stay back! Going any closer could cost you your life." #br##br#
#&53$Barthold looks deadly serious.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Heeding the words of the archmage, you back away from the portal, yet can't seem to take your eyes from it. You manage to pry yourself away and turn to Barthold. Determined to discover the reason for this portal's appearance, you ask him what he knows.##char$$823:0$0#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"It is uncommon for someone unskilled in dimensional magic to be able to perceive a Dimensional Fissure, yet somehow...#br##br#
#&53$Barthold trails off as he notices your Eidolon standing beside you.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Ah, I see... No wonder you can sense it. You're no ordinary person. An Envoy..."#br##br#
#&53$Barthold's strange mannerisms are starting to make you uncomfortable.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask the mysterious old man if he knows why you can see this so-called Dimensional Fissure while others cannot.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Everything will be revealed, child. But now...now is not that time. I must focus all my powers to contain the energies being released from the fissure..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Sensing that he will accept no more questions on the subject, you inquire as to whether or not there is anything you can do to assist him.##char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Hmm...The assistance of an Envoy could prove fortuitous indeed."#br##br#
#&53$Barthold holds his breath for a moment and focuses intensely on the fissure, then begins to speak again...##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"You know that our world is only one plane of existence. Occasionally...a link will open between Terra and another realm. Thus, a Dimensional Fissure is formed, as you see here."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"My life's work is to ensure that no monster - demon, beast, or otherwise - crosses into our world. As I speak, a demon is trying to break through the planar corridor and enter our world."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Someday, if you are touched by Dimensional Magic, you will begin to understand... If you truly do intend to help, that day will be sooner than you expect!"#npc$$825$1#|
20354|You feel a sinister aura expanding over the countryside, and know that its source must be nearby. After examining your options, you head to Crescent Hill to investigate the source of this dark phenomenon.|
20361|#&S00508#
#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You sense the unstable, twisting energy of the Dimensional Fissure - much stronger now than the first time you felt it. Could something have happened to form another Dimensional Fissure?##char$$1:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Focusing on the nexus of the energy, you sense that it lies somewhere in the town of Brevis, in the Cactakara Forest. ##char$$803:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$With no time to lose, you hurry there to find out what has befallen the town.##char$$806:0$0#|
20362|#&7$Virginia##br#
"I must find a way to notify my mentor..."#br##br#
#&53$Virginia fidgets, clearly nervous.##npc$$828$1#|
20363|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Dimensional Fissure up ahead looks very similar to the last one you encountered. It seems that more than just a few dark spirits are interested in crossing the border between realms. ##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Virginia that you are willing to fight the beings coming through the portal and tell her of your experiences with Barthold at Crescent Hill.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Virginia##br#
"Oh, hey - Barthold is my mentor. He's mentioned you before."#br##br#
#&53$Virginia gives you a weary smile. It's easy to tell from her slumped shoulders that she's put in tremendous effort trying to seal the Dimensional Fissure.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Virginia##br#
"I really could use your help. This fissure here is about to split wide open." #npc$$828$1#|
20364|Once more, you sense the strange energy unique to the Dimensional Fissures. After careful observation, you trace the source of the energy to Brevis in Cactakara Forest and head there to investigate the situation.|
20371|#&S00804#
#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The journey must have been going too smoothly, for only a Dimensional Fissure could emit such a terrible energy.##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A sense of dread grasps at your heart; this outpouring of dark energy feels even stronger than the last. Spirits more powerful and malevolent than before must be gathering at the border between this world and the spirit realm.##char$$1:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Focusing your mind to divine the source of these evil emanations, you narrow the location of the Dimensional Fissure to somewhere in Candetonn, in the Candeo Marsh.##char$$1:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Time is of the essence - hurry there and see what's happening.##char$$824:0$0#|
20372|#&7$Tacrine##br#
"This...this isn't good at all..." #br##br#
#&53$Tacrine shakes his head, weighed down by anxiety. ##npcs85h+70$$828$1#|
20373|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Dimensional Fissure up ahead looks highly volatile, with Tacrine locked in a struggle to stabilize it. ##npcs85h+70$$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Careful not to distract Tacrine's attention from the Fissure,
you quickly explain that you have some experience dealing with these fissures, and that you're willing to lend a hand here. ##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Tacrine##br#
"I'm glad someone knows what's going on here, because I'm just about out of options. This Dimensional Fissure leads to another realm, and I'm trying my hardest to close it." #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Tacrine##br#
#&53$Tacrine turns, casting a grave look toward the unstable Fissure. ##npc$$2$1#|
20374|Once again, the ominous dark energy of a Dimensional Fissure resonates within you. As you meditate in an attempt to discover the source, your search narrows to the town of Candetonn in the Candeo Marsh. Heading there, you can only hope you aren't too late to keep disaster at bay.|
20381|#&S00909#
#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$A wave of roiling energy surges over you. No stranger to this phenomenon by now, you pause, triangulating the dark energy's point of origin.##char:0$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Yes...there's no mistaking it. This energy signature could only mean another Dimensional Fissure. They seem to be cropping up with increasing frequency these days... ##char:0$$806$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Your attuned senses narrow the location down to somewhere within the Ventos Tribe's lands on the Ventos Prairie. Hurrying there, you hope you can lend a hand and prevent a disaster. ##char:0$$806$0#|
20382|#&7$Nelanna##br#
"It's not looking good. We may have to report back..." #br##br#
#&53$Nelanna's voice quavers with worry.##npc$$828$1#|
20383|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Like the previous Dimensional Fissures, this one looks highly unstable. Nelanna is doing everything in her power to seal the rift.##npc$$311$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"You... you can actually see the Dimensional Fissure?" #br##br#
#&53$Nelanna gapes at you.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Unfortunately yes, you can see the Fissures - and feel them too. Without hesitation, you say that you're ready to smack down anything that comes out of that breach.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"Whoa! You're %n%! You're the one the other Dimensional Mages can't stop talking about!" #br##br#
#&53$You're not sure if Nelanna totally believes in your abilities, but she seems to breathe a sign of relief at the thought of having some help.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"As you can see, we've got a Dimensional Fissure on our hands here. This one's different, though - I strongly suspect it's being forced open from the other side." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"We don't usually see something like this, but in those cases where we have, the one sure thing is that we're gonna have one helluva fight on our hands." #br##br#
#&53$Nelanna glances back at the Dimensional Fissure, her brow furrowed with worry.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"Having your help now would be super. So super that I might even survive!" #npc$$822$1#|
20384|That familiar sensation of a new Dimensional Fissure washes over you again. This time it comes from the Ventos Tribe's lands in the Ventos Prairie. The energy  is especially strong, leading you to quickly investigate it.|
20391|#&7$Barthold##br#
"This Crystal Key can unlock the Dimensional Shackles. There are three Dimensional Shackles in the Corridor, and three different people must use the Crystal Key to open them." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"This means you need to find two companions to enter the Dimensional Fissure with you. When all three of you open the three Dimensional Shackles in the Corridor, the entrance will open for a short time. However, it'll also allow extra-dimensional beings to enter our world." #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"This is a dangerous mission, but you need to defeat those monsters." #br##br#
#&53$Barthold's stare pins you to your spot.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Here's the Dimensional Crystal Key. Remember, after you enter the Dimensional Fissure, those fiends will be out for blood." #br##br# #&53$Barthold presses the Dimensional Crystal Key firmly into your palm.##npc$$825$1#|
20392|#&7$Barthold##br#
"You cannot complete this mission without two others. That's the only way you can unlock the Dimensional Shackles in the Corridor. One person just can't do it alone - they'd be overwhelmed." #npc$$821$1#|
20393|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You wipe glowing blood from your hands, telling Barthold that you've defeated the monsters from the rift. ##char$$821$0#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Dare I breathe a sigh of relief? Even knowing they'll probably be back at some point can't dampen my happiness! Now, let's get that rift locked and sealed again." #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Barthold##br#
"Here, I've got something for you. Please, take it - you deserve it." #br##br# #&53$Barthold hands you a gift.##npc$$822$1#|
20394|Barthold gave you a Crystal Key, but in order to open the Dimensional Shackles, you need to find two other brave souls to enter the Dimensional Hall with you. By unlocking the three Dimensional Shackles, you'll unleash monsters into the Hall, making for a risky venture. If you don't stop them, the results will be unpleasant, to say the least.|
20401|#&7$Virginia##br#
"I'm beginning to lose count of how many times this rift has been on the edge of bursting. If we don't seal it..." #br##br#
#&53$Virginia looks wearily at the Dimensional Fissure, exhausted.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Virginia##br#
"You need to enter the Dimensional Hall and unlock the shackles inside. Next...well, I think you know what'll happen. Monsters. Monsters everywhere."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Virginia##br#
#&53$Virginia holds out the Dimensional Crystal Key, pleading with her eyes for you to take it.##npc$$1$1#|
20402|#&7$Virginia##br#
"I'm...not sure how much longer I can keep this up..."#br##br#
"Hurry! Find two reliable allies and take those keys into the Dimensional Hall. If those monsters make it into our world, we're as good as done for."#npc$$311$1#|
20403|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Virginia of the outcome of your battle with the monsters in the Dimensional Hall.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Virginia##br#
"I would've never been able to keep it up without your help. I wish I had more time to rest, but now I must reinforce the Dimensional Shackles in the Hall so nothing else tries to worm its way through."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Virginia##br#
"Here, take this. You worked hard, and hey, we might need your help again later."#br##br# #&53$Virginia hands you the gift.##npc$$824$1#|
20404|Virginia gave you a Crystal Key, but in order to open the Dimensional Shackles, you needed to find two other brave souls to enter the Dimensional Hall with you. By unlocking the three Dimensional Shackles, you'll unleash monsters into the Hall - a risky enterprise at the best of times. But you must defeat them, otherwise they'll surely visit their wrath upon the world.|
20411|#&7$Tacrine##br#
"Ever since this Dimensional Fissure appeared, nasty creatures from the spirit realm have been trying to push into ours. I'm an experienced mage, but it's taking all I have just to hold them back." #npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$Tacrine##br#
"If you'd like to help, go find two other willing souls. I need three people to open the Shackles in the Dimensional Hall." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Tacrine##br#
"I'm sure you know what'll happen after that. The barrier comes down, the monsters rush in, and of your party and theirs, only one's gonna come back out."#br##br##&53$Tacrine hands you a Dimensional Crystal Key.##npc$$822$1#|
20412|#&7$Tacrine##br#
"If those monsters break through, their power will reshape the face of our world, and I doubt any of us will like what that future would look like." #npcs85h+70$$1$1#|
20413|#&7$Tacrine##br#
"I hope everything went well..."#npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Tacrine a blow-by-blow report of your colossal battle in the Dimensional Hall.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tacrine##br#
"Wow! You always seem to come through for us. Are you sure you don't want to join us full-time?" #br##br#
#&53$Tacrine laughs, obviously relieved.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Tacrine##br#
"I've gotta go lock up the Dimensional Shackles again. But before that, I want to give this to you." #br##br#
#&53$Tacrine hands you a gift.##npc$$822$1#|
20414|Tacrine gave you a Crystal Key, but in order to open the Dimensional Shackles, you needed to find two other brave souls to enter the Dimensional Hall with you. By unlocking the three Dimensional Shackles, you'll unleash monsters into the Hall. Once you've freed them, there's no going back - kill or be killed, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.|
20421|#&7$Nelanna##br#
"This Dimensional Fissure is getting too difficult to handle. I've tried everything I can think of to control it, but it keeps getting stronger." #br##br#
#&53$Nelanna grunts and grits her teeth, focusing on the rift.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"At this point, the only way to stabilize the Dimensional Fissure is to enter its Corridor and unlock the Dimensional Shackles, but that would let the monsters right on the other side into our realm. #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"Strong as you are, I don't think even you can do it yourself. You'd need at least two other people. Then you could use this set of Crystal Keys to open the Shackles." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"Here, take this Crystal Key. I'd try to join you myself, but then there'd be no one to control the situation here. I've grown too weak already. You, though... you might actually be able to drive those unruly spirits back into their own realm." #npc$$821$1#|
20422|#&7$Nelanna##br#
"The Dimensional Fissure is growing more and more unstable. It's only a matter of time before it creates a link between our world and theirs.#br##br#
#&53$Near exhaustion, Nelanna continues to channel more magic to stabilize the Fissure as long as possible.##npc$$311$1#|
20423|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You announce your victory over the monsters to Nelanna. ##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"You're the real deal, I guess. Looks like we're both out to protect the world, and let me say, the more in that camp, the merrier." #br##br# #&53$Nelanna grins.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Nelanna##br#
"Here's a little something for all you've done. If you ever decide you want to join us full-time, we'll welcome you into the fold." #npc$$822$1#|
20424|Nelanna gave you a Crystal Key, but in order to open the Dimensional Shackles, you needed to find two other brave souls to enter the Dimensional Hall with you. By unlocking the three Dimensional Shackles, you'll unleash the monsters into the fissure's hall. Loose them, slay them, and seal the Fissure more securely.|
20431|#&7$Halton##br#
"Patrolmen are reporting that there are still some people inside the Alabastren Temple that won't leave. Grandpa is worried that this will cause another disaster." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"We've already reported this matter to the Church, but who knows how long it'll take for them to take care of it? What do you think, %n%? Any suggestions?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You offer to enter the temple to take a look. Once you're inside, you can brainstorm some solution to resolve the conflict. Perhaps you can come up with ideas to resolve the situation once you're there.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Halton##br#
"I'd suggest taking a few people in with you, just to be on the safe side. I don't know how rough a time you're in for, but I can't imagine it'll be easy."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Halton##br#
"Or, how about this? Grandpa has some emergency funds stashed away for situations like this. That might tempt people into helping you solve the problem at the Temple! 
Go and find Grandpa when you're done. I'm sure he'll be happy to see you." #npc$$821$1#|
20432|#&7$Omar##br#
"Alabastren Temple was once a holy place, but I worry that the invaders may do something foolish and bring a crisis upon us all. If their idiocy brings harm to the village, so help me, I'll..."#npc$$821$1#|
20433|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Omar that you already paid a visit to the Alabastren Temple, taking out both the invaders and the monsters trying to break through the seal. Things should be pretty safe, at least for now.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Omar##br#
"W-what?! Really? That's the best news I've heard all week! If you hadn't shown up, %n%, we'd still be stuck trying to guess our way out of this problem."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
"Halton talked to me earlier -  something about recruitment money. The boy's heart is in the right place, but his sense of value is all askew. That recruitment money? You deserve MORE than that. I'll give you three times that!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Omar##br#
#&53$Omar chortles to himself, looking quite satisfied as he hands you a considerable reward.##npc$$822$1#|
20434|Invaders broke into the Alabastren Temple and are gathering there - potentially to release the powerful monsters within. Village Chief Omar was worried, but didn't know how long it would take the Church to send Templars to deal with the problem. Therefore, Halton sought your help. 

Enter Alabastren Temple (5 people) and stop any monsters the invaders are summoning.|
20441|#&7$Junior##br#
"Here's the deal, %n%: we have the contamination problem in Gydaie Glen under control, but we still have to seal up the entrance behind the waterfall." #npcs85h+70$$1$1#

#&7$Junior##br#
"You know that important artifacts were left there by Dwarves' ancestors, right? They're a part of our heritage." #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Junior##br#
"The village is pretty much split down the middle on what to do about this. Some want to seal up the entrance and forget about the whole mess. Others want to retrieve our heritage to learn more about our past." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Junior##br#
"We can't do anything until an agreement's been arranged. While we're sitting here on out thumbs debating the merits of each plan back and forth, who knows what'll come out from behind that waterfall?" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Junior##br#
"The Village Chief wants to hire a few strong backs like you to enter Gydaie Glen and clear out any dangers there. He's prepared a handsome compensation, if I say so myself, so why not find a couple reliable allies and check it out?" #npc$$2$1#

Go to Gydaie Glen (5 People) and complete the quest there.
Forming a party is recommended, so use the Recruitment function to find party members.|
20442|#&7$Alain##br#
"Yeah, about that discussion on whether to seal the entrance to Gydaie Glen... It's lookin' like we won't reach an agreement for a while, to say the least. Both sides are making pretty strong cases." #npcs85h+70$$2$1#|
20443|#&7$Alain##br#
There's not much we can do until we reach an accord, but before that, we have to devise a plan that ensures everyone's safety." #br##br# #&53$Alain mumbles to himself as he reads something aloud.##npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Alain that you've already entered Gydaie Glen and defeated the monsters that posed a danger to the area. For the time being, the entrance to Gydaie Glen should be safe.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Wow...that's what I call efficiency!" #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"You have no idea how much this situation was tearing me apart! 
I can't even remember the last time I got a full night of sleep." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Alain##br#
"Everyone goes on with their bickering, but no one seems to realize that we still have to pay for guards to keep the area around the waterfall safe. That should've been squared away before everything else." #npc$$828$1#|
20444|The villagers were faced with a choice: seal the entrance to Gydaie Glen, or leave it open? Brevis's Chief Alain has asked you to clear the area of danger while their council is deciding which course of action to take.

Enter Gydaie Glen (5 People) and eliminate anything that may pose a danger to Cactakara Forest.|
20451|#&7$Chelsea##br#
"%n%, according to my reports, people have been gathering at Miner's Steppe. I strongly suspect they're in league with the Shadow Knight."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"These guys are persistent, I'll give them that. They're likely waiting for our attention to wane so they can continue excavating more Miracle Stones. They may even unearth some rare gems."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You remind Chelsea that it won't be easy for the Shadow Knight's followers to gather Miracle Stones, but agree that to keep the Shadow Knight from getting his hands on even one, they must be stopped."##char$$821$0#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"That's our intention, of course. Our leader hopes you can assemble a crew to join you in Miner's Steppe and take down the Shadow Knight's followers."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Chelsea##br#
"Remember to be careful. Whatever the outcome, report your results to our Team Leader, Victoria."#npc$$821$1#

#&53$Go to Miner's Steppe (5 People) and complete the task given to you. Bringing a party is recommended, so use the Recruitment function to find allies.#|
20452|#&7$Victoria##br#
"A suspicious, unsavory group is gathering on the outskirts of of Miner's Steppe again. Followers of the Shadow Knight, no doubt - they probably took advantage of the chaos to sneak inside."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Well, whatever luck they might've been having before, the Templars are here to crush their foul machinations under our heels. We're already in the process of securing the area."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Oh, %n%, you haven't left yet? I need your help to resolve this situation as soon as possible. Why not recruit some extra help? Your opponent IS the Shadow Knight, after all..."#npc$$821$1#|
20453|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report to Victoria what transpired in Miner's Steppe, noting that you defeated the Shadow Knight's minions.##char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Excellent work, thank you. I can't imagine it was an easy task, even for a powerful squad."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Our goal now is to get Tomitsa back on track and restore the mines to working order."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"There's no way we're going to sit idle and allow the Shadow Knight to ruin our hard work."#npc$$827$1#|
20454|According to the Templars' intelligence report, the Shadow Knight's forces have entered Miner's Steppe. You must gather together a team to go and defeat them. 

Enter Miner's Steppe (5 People) and stop the Shadow Knight's minions from carrying out their plot.|
20461|#&7$Bloom##br#
"We have reports from the Hunters' patrols that the creatures of Deep's Cavern are creating quite a stir. I wonder if the Avians have lured something into the Cavern..." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Bloom##br#
"My guess is, at this rate they'll wake up the wild animals sleeping in the cavern. If those beasts come raging into the Highlands, they'll tear up the village AND the hunting grounds!" #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Bloom##br#
"%n%, I'm hoping you can lead a team to tackle this problem at the source, in Deep's Cavern. Your mission will be to drive out those Avians, and stop the beasts inside from getting out." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, then ask Bloom what to watch out for. ##char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Bloom##br#
"I think it's most important to round up some solid help first.
If all goes well, you'll have some good news for Chief Dallan." #npc$$821$1#

Descend into Deep's Cavern (5 People) and complete the quests there. It's recommended that you form a party, using the Recruitment function.|
20462|#&7$Dallan##br#
"Those Argus Cult Avians give us no end of problems. They don't care what happens to the Highlands - they have no concept of environmental sustainability." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"They're surely aware of all the ferocious, unknown creatures living in Deep's Cavern, yet they keep going in. One of these days, they'll go in, and horrific beasts will come pouring out." #npc$$821$1#|
20463|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You tell Dallan that you cleared Deep's Cavern of its Avian infiltrators and defeated the monstrous beasts trying to escape.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"Well well! Without you, I don't know how we would've gotten out of this one. None of the village's hunters can match your raw skill. We'd need to stockpile thousands of tranquilizing darts, but you just mow through 'em." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"Anyway, I wanted to say thanks on behalf of all of us. Please, take this gift - the village wants you to have it." #npc$$824$1#|
20464|Avians snuck into Deep's Cavern again. If they send the cave's fierce beasts into a frenzy, those beasts could tear up the Highlands in a frenzied rampage. The Hunters' Mountain Village asked you to go and take care of the problem.

Enter Deep's Cavern (5 People) and thin out the Avians. Then stop the beasts in the cave from spilling out and trampling the Highlands.|
20471|#&7$April##br#
"The Templars are planning to withdraw, and that has me worried for the village's safety." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You volunteer to enter Candeo Core while the Sarpa are assembling to defeat them.##char$$821$0#

#&7$April##br#
"I'm glad you're willing to help out, but this isn't going to be easy mode, y'know. You'll need some backup this time around."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$April##br#
"I can't imagine how happy the village chief will be when he finds out you're here to help us!" #npc$$826$1#

#&53$Head to Candeo Core in the Candeo Marsh (5 People) and complete the quest there. It's recommended that you form a party via the Recruitment interface.#|
20472|#&7$Jeffery##br#
"My mind must be turning to mush. Why are the Sarpa gathering again? What the heck are they trying to accomplish?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"The villagers don't dare get close to the Candeo Core anymore. I'm afraid we'll have to hire mercenaries to help us now." #npc$$821$1#|
20473|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform the troubled Jeffery that you've already fought off the Sarpa in Candeo Core.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"Wow. It's like a great weight was just lifted from my shoulders. I had no idea what we were going to do with the Sarpa and the Corpsers, especially without the Templars' help."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You don't recall seeing Corpsers, but you assure Jeffery that the Sarpa won't be planning any attacks for a while.##char$$809:80$0#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"Ah...that's the sweet sound of peace. You're truly the savior of Candetonn. I hope that after the Templars withdraw, you'll stay around and help out around the village."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Jeffery##br#
"Anyway, please take this. You've more than earned it."#npc$$821$1#|
20474|The Sarpa are gathering in Candeo Core, and it seems only a matter of time before they attack Candetonn. Village Chief Jeffery is looking for a brave warrior to take the fight to them and shut them down.

20481|#&7$Simpson##br#
"His Majesty has been very worried about the situation in Wrathborne Temple." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Curious, you ask Simpson what's going on there.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"We've received information from Shashek informing us that Wrathborne Temple's new seal is still solidifying, and is in a vulnerable state. If it's disturbed before it has a chance to stabilize, we may be worse off than before all of this began." #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"%n%, let me ask you: are you willing to work on behalf of the Ventos Tribe to enter Wrathborne Temple and ensure the stability of the seal?" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"You'd be best served by forming a group of similarly-skilled warriors to fend off the monsters tampering with the seal. His majesty eagerly awaits a report of success, which I hope you can deliver." #npc$$821$1#

Enter Wrathborne Temple (5 people) and complete the quest there. It's recommended that you form a party, using the Recruitment function.|
20482|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Only warriors seeking to test their limits enter the Wrathborne Temple." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"So, of course, when the temple's seal began to falter, we couldn't simply send the army in to deal with it..." #npc$$822$1#|
20483|#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Come, let me look at you, %n%..." #br##br#
#&53$Leo slowly nods his head, eyes narrowing sharply as he gazes at you with careful scrutiny.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"I felt in my bones that you would return with good news, and indeed, you have slain the monsters within Wrathborne Temple. Now, the seal will stabilize, and the temple will be secure." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod briskly, affirming Leo's incisive guess. The monsters in the temple have been dealt with, and the area is now at peace.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Leo Ryan##br#
"Good, good. Take this gold - a worthy prize for a true warrior." #npc$$821$1#|
20484|The Wrathborne Temple's seal was repaired, but it needs time to develop its full strength. Now, monsters threaten to break it while it's still vulnerable. Leo has called on you display your battle prowess once more and eliminate the threat in the Wrathborne Temple. 

Enter the Wrathborne Temple (5 People) and defeat the monsters trying to break the seal.|
20491|#&7$Wallace##br#
"That whole misunderstanding with Tafay Village is finally behind us, thankfully. Now, it's Nudak Fortress's responsibility to protect the village." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"You defeated the evil spirits of Ghostweep Cave before. However, we have information from the village showing that some unknown creature still lurks in those haunted caverns." #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"The energy readings are similar to those we took last time, and that likely means we've still got some remaining undead in the area." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Wallace if he has a plan in place to handle the situation. ##char$$821$0#

#&7$Wallace##br#
"The soldiers posted here aren't familiar with Ghostweep Cave, so right now, our most efficient option is to have you lead a team to clean out the area. No running solo on this one - I can't risk the mission on just one fighter." #npc$$822$1#

Spelunk the depths of Ghostweep Cave (5 People) and complete the quest there. It's recommended that you form a party, using the Recruitment function.|
20492|#&7$Carrick##br#
"Assuming these reports are true, we need to dispatch a unit post-haste to deal with the undead swarming in Ghostsweep Cave." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"I've gotta hand it to both you and the village - you've extended our ability to get things done around here." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Well? Why're you still standing there? Am I just that dazzlingly handsome? Go on, there's a dungeon calling." #npc$$821$1#|
20493|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Carrick that you returned to Ghostweep Cave and put the undead to rest, informing him about what was going on there.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Carrick##br#
"Outstanding work, soldier. Money could hardly buy intel this good. I hope I can get my army as fighting-fit as you. Maybe I should put them on an Envoy of Gaia training regimen." #npc$$821$1#

20494|After Nudak Fortress and Tafay Village joined forces, their scouting parties detected an abnormal energy emanating from Ghostweep Cave, meaning it's likely the undead still have a foothold there. Since you were already familiar with the cave, you were tasked with leading a team to flush out the spectral caverns.

Enter Ghostweep Cave (5 People) and defeat the terrifying legions of undead lurking in its depths.|

"I believe many adventurers have the skills necessary to enter the Ozymand Temple and break the curse, but it seems you're the only one who's risen to the occasion, %n%." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"The Sanknie Alliance sent two fully-outfitted expedition teams, but not a single person was able to bring back any treasure from the temple. They've made many forays, of course, but the dangers lurking within have proven too great each time." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"%n%, our expedition teams need your help! Hayes has spoken quite highly of your work, and he has quite the eye for efficiency. We can throw our gold at guards and mercenaries to attempt this, but I'd rather just hire you. Yes...I can see it - if you put together a trustworthy team, you'd have the best odds out of anyone." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Ferdinand##br#
"Give it some thought. We're not short on funding now - every successful trip you make into the temple will be rewarded. Hayes wouldn't have it any other way." #npc$$827$1#

Enter Ozymand Temple (5 People) and complete the quest there.
It's recommended that you form a party, using the Recruitment function.|
20502|#&7$Hayes##br#
"Finding the treasure is only half of the problem. The other half is figuring out how to transport it back! Akara helped us get to the temple, but how to get inside - ah, that's the new conundrum!" #npc$$827$1#|
20503|#&7$Hayes##br#
"Back already, I see!" #br##br# #&53$Hayes smiles, his mood much lighter than the last time you saw him.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You report the details of your excursion into Ozymand Temple, sure to mention how you crushed anything that might pose a threat to the expedition teams. The temple's main corridor is now free of danger, you say with a satisfied nod.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"I thank the powers-that-be that we met - if not for you, the Alliance would've cut the funding for my Star Plan project ages ago. But look what a force it is now!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"The Sanknie Alliance is excellent with support - for the projects they deem worthy. But you've stuck with me during the lean times, and now, you should share in the times of plenty." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Hayes##br#
"To gain a person's trust is difficult; to gain a merchant's trust, that takes a certain something more." #br##br# #&53$Hayes hands you the reward.##npc$$822$1#|
20504|Every time an Expedition Team has entered Ozymand Temple, the terrors within send them scurrying back. The ancient curse still lingers, but Hayes hopes you can clear out the temple, allowing its treasures to be transported back to the camp.

Enter Ozymand Temple (5 People) and clear its halls of nefarious creatures so that the Expedition Team can gain access to the treasures within.|

#&53$Luther gives you a package. It's an empty lightweight backpack. Seems like a useful thing to keep with you.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Luther##br#
"Keep it with you. You might not need it, but I still thought it would suit you more than giving you some random clutter,"#br##br#
#&53$Luther says with a sigh.##npc$$821$1#

#&53$While travelling a carrier pigeon suddenly swoops out of the air, stopping in front of you. Taking the message from the pigeon, you open it and read:##char$$821$0#

#&7$Preston##br#
"Dear %n%, greetings.#br##br#
My name is Preston, I'm the CEO of Anglers Anonymous. I most profusely apologize for disturbing you amidst your many cares and duties. I ask, however, whether with all your responsibilities as Envoy of Gaia, you are in need of a more leisurely pastime?" #M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"Anglers Anonymous was established very recently, and has only just begun to flourish. If you have an interest in fishing, and some time to spare, we warmly invite you to take part in our organization." #M119020$Preston$821$1#|
20672|#&7$Preston##br#
... #npc$$821$1#|
20673|#&7$Preston##br#
"Hehe, %n%, you've come! Are you ready to experience the sheer delight that is fishing? I've already got a Basic Fishing Rod and some Bait ready for you, so let me just take a moment to explain a few things about fishing to you." #M119020$Preston$821$1#|
20674|Preston, the CEO of Anglers Anonymous, invites you to come find him in Navea, to learn more about fishing.|
20681|#&7$Preston##br#
"Alright, let's start with the basics! If you want to fish, you must first prepare and equip a Fishing Rod and Bait. Just go to a pool of water where there is a school of fish and click on it. This will bring up the Fishing Interface."#npc$$821$1##&V0009#

#&7$Preston##br#
"When a fish bites, the interface's large fish icon will flash. Click on that icon to enter manual fishing mode. If you don't click on that icon while it's flashing, auto-fishing will resume."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"A Bobber and control meter will appear while in manual fishing mode. The meter changes based on the fish being caught, and the bobber will move. If the meter stays blue, you're doing great, but once it turns yellow it means the fish is pulling free. Red means the line will snap."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"There are two additional bars at the top left of the Fishing Interface. The lower one refers to the durability of your fishing rod while the upper one shows your fish's endurance. If the bobber is over the yellow area, the rod's durability will drop. If it runs out completely, you'll lose your catch."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"However, if your fish's endurance runs out before that happens, the fish is yours!"#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"While you fish, the bobber moves constantly. To control it, hold down the left-mouse button over the large fish icon; the bobber will shift to the right. Do your best to keep the bobber in the blue area!"#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"If the bobber stays in the red area for more than three seconds, your line will snap and the fish will get away."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"One last thing to note: You won't get a bite every time you cast. The biggest thing about fishing is having patience. Well, I think that's everything...."#M119020$Preston$821$1#

#&7$Preston##br#
"I think it's time you go and try it out! I suggest going to Port Skandia and catching a Small Shrimp. Give it to Seth in Skandia. He'll assist you with the next step." #M119020$Preston$821$1#|
20682|#&7$Seth##br#
"You're the one our Chief Exec said wanted to come learn how to fish, right? You can catch Small Shrimp all along the coast around here. So go ahead and catch me one of them, alright?"#M101010$Seth$821$1#|
20683|#&7$Seth##br#
"Are you %n%? I'm Seth, the local Anglers Anonymous Merchant. I assume you've already heard our Chief Exec's little spiel. Ah, well done! You have caught a Small Shrimp! Then let's continue with the next lesson."#M101010$Seth$821$1#|
20684|Now that the CEO of Anglers Anonymous has filled you in on the fishing controls, go see Seth at the Port Skandia and catch a Small Shrimp.|
20691|#&7$Seth##br#
"Now, I should first of all explain the aspects of fishing that are affected by different abilities. These abilities are your Reeling Speed, Fishing Rod Strength and Fishing Line Strength, which determine the effectiveness of your controls while fishing."#M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Your Reeling Speed affects the the Bobber's movement speed. Fishing Line Strength affects the width of the green Safe Zone. Fishing Rod Strength affects the speed at which Fish Endurance drops." #M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Next let me explain the different types of Fishing Rods and Fishing Gear:#br##br#
Both Rods and Fishing Gear come in four styles: Speed, Strength, Skill and All-Around Styles."#M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Speed Equipment allows an especially high Reeling Speed, Skill Equipment boosts your Fishing Line Strength significantly, and Strength Equipment boosts your Fishing Rod Strength to aid in battling big fish."#M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"As for All-Around Equipment, they affect all three abilities equally. Each type of fish behaves differently, so your Fishing Rod and Fishing Gear are quite important. It's up to you to decide what fish to catch with what equipment, with first hand experience through trial and error you'll learn joyous sport of fishing!"#M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Oh right, there are Lures, too. There are certain types of bait you should use to catch certain types of fish. Matching fish with their preferred bait will make catching them a bit easier!" #M101010$Seth$821$1#

#&7$Seth##br#
"Next, I'd like you to go find Frazier on the Silverash Shores of Helonia Coast and catch three Grass Carp for him."#M101010$Seth$821$1#|
20692|#&7$Frazier##br#
"Have you found a decent spot for Grass Carp fishing? You should be able to catch them at the Silverash Shores, straight ahead."#m110020$Frazier$821$1#|
20693|#&7$Frazier##br#
"Haha, so you're here to learn some tricks of the fishing trade as well? Well, these Grass Carp are nice and fresh, so I'll just take them off your hands first." #m110020$Frazier$821$1#|
20694|Now that you've heard Seth explain the different types of Fishing Gear, go now to the Silverash Shores on Helonia Coast and find Frazier there. Catch three Grass Carp for him and he'll teach you some more techniques.|
20701|#&7$Frazier##br#
"Seth must have sent you over, eh? Right, well listen up. Each region has a very large type of fish lurking in its waters."#m110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"And these fish, let me tell you... if you use the wrong Fishing Rod they are nigh on impossible to catch. You've got to have the right Fishing Rod and Fishing Gear, and you've got to be in Manual Fishing Mode 
if you want to have any chance at all." #m110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"I think our CEO's given you a Fishing Rod, right? Well, it's peak season for Lucky Petal Fish at Crescent Hill, and I have here a Fishing Rod Fusion Pattern." #m110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"First use your Fishing Rod to catch a Lucky Petal Fish, and once you've caught it, skin it for its Lucky Fish Skin. Finally, take the Lucky Fish Skin and the Rod that Preston gave you, and use my Pattern to fuse together a Beginner's Luck Fishing Rod." #m110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"Thanks to the Fish Skin, the Fishing Rod that the Lucky Petal Fish produces is extremely resilient. The Lucky Petal Fish brings your Fishing Rod Strength and Average Fishing Ability up a certain amount. I can see it being a great help to you."#m110020$Frazier$821$1#

#&7$Frazier##br#
"You can find Lucky Petal Fish near the pond at Coordinates (285, 643) in the Periphery of Navea. After that, go see Bennin at the Altar of the Moon on Crescent Hill. Then equip your newly fused Fishing Rod and have her appraise it."#m110020$Frazier$821$1#|
20702|#&7$Bennin##br#
"Eh? You haven't equipped your Beginner's Luck Rod. You have to take the skin of the Lucky Petal Fish and your Beginner's Fishing Rod and use Frazier's Fusion Pattern to fuse them together."#m106020$Bennin$821$1#|
20703|#&7$Bennin##br#
"Hello! I'm Bennin, the Anglers Anonymous Merchant for Crescent Hill. You caught a Lucky Petal Fish? Allow me to inspect!"#m106020$Bennin$821$1#|
20704|Take the Fishing Rod the CEO gave you and go to Crescent Hill as Frazier told you. Use Manual Fishing Mode there to catch a Lucky Petal Fish, and then fuse its Lucky Fish Skin to your Beginner's Fishing Rod. Equip the new Beginner's Luck Rod and have Bennin appraise it at the Altar of the Moon on Crescent Hill.|
20711|#&7$Bennin##br#
"Ooh, let me see... Ah! What a great Fishing Rod! What a clever thing you are! I know it's peak season for Lucky Petal Fish and all, but not just anybody can throw in a line and catch one."#m106020$Bennin $821$1#

#&7$Bennin ##br#
"This Fishing Rod isn't shabby, either! I shouldn't be surprised really, since you used Lucky Petal Fish to make it. This next challenge will be all the easier with it in your hands."#m106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin ##br#
"Everywhere has its own 'Fish King'. They appear randomly in every region, when they do appear though, they only stick around for 30 minutes, and you need to use specialty Fishing Lures in order to catch them."#m106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"After those 30 minutes, it'll be another eight hours before they come back. Otherwise, if you want to catch one of these Fish Kings, besides making sure you're in Manual Mode, you have to use special Fish King Lures. Without one of these, the Fish Kings will just plain ignore you."#m106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"As well, from time to time when you're out there fishing you might get a surprise call from the Penguin Bandits. They often hide in the shadows only to spring out and attack fishermen, making off with their catch. You must be cautious if you're to fend them off."#m106020$Bennin$821$1#

#&7$Bennin##br#
"Next, I'd like you to visit Cactakara Forest. Using your newly fused Fishing Rod and a special Colorful Fish King Lure that I'm going to give you, try to catch the Colorful Fish King and give it to Fargo at the Competition Arena nearby."#m106020$Bennin$821$1#|
20712|#&7$Fargo##br#
"Can't find the Colorful Fish King? Try looking around Alba Shoal." #m116010$Fargo$821$1#|
20713|#&7$Fargo##br#
"Whoa! Is that the Colorful Fish King? You're a true artist of angling, my friend, to have landed one of the Fish Kings."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"I'll bet you just had a run-in with Nebuchadnezzar too, the Penguin Bandit leader? That fiend is always ready to ambush those with their sights on catching a Fish Kings. There's also a Penguin called Nymphet who surprises fishermen after a large catch."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"For normal fish though it's the Penguin Bandits that are likely to abscond with your haul. If you see these guys again, be sure teach them a lesson! These Penguins have stolen many a good fisherman's catch, causing us in Anglers Anonymous no end of grief and frustration!" #M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"The Penguins always carry a token on them, symbolizing their membership in the Penguin Bandits. If you defeat one of them, make sure you take the token. You can exchange these for prizes with Myrna, the Anglers Anonymous Director." #M116010$Fargo$821$1#

#&7$Fargo##br#
"Well it seems like you've learned all you need to learn about fishing! There's really nothing else I can teach you. That's the basics all covered for you anyways. Oh wait, I think Myrna, the Anglers Anonymous Director, needs people to help with a fish supply problem. If you have time, you can always go into Navea and see."#M116010$Fargo$821$1#|
20714|Using your newly fused Fishing Rod and the special Colorful Fish King Lure from Bennin, go to Cactakara Forest and catch the Colorful Fish King in Manual Fishing Mode. Once it's caught, give it to Fargo whom you'll find near the Competition Arena.|

#&7$Elle##br#
"I came out here to find them, but I guess they went fishing somewhere else. I don't know where else to go, so I guess I'll head back... I bet you like to fish too, right? Is that why you're out here?"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"Thanks a bunch for listening to my sob story, %n%. I'll be more than happy to show you a thing or two about fishing."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"If you want to fish, you must first prepare and equip a Fishing Rod and Bait. Just go to a pool of water where there is a school of fish and click on it. This will bring up the Fishing Interface."#npc$$821$1##&V0009#

#&7$Elle##br#
"When a fish bites, the interface's large fish icon will flash. Click on that icon to enter manual fishing mode. If you don't click on that icon while it's flashing, auto-fishing will resume."#M119020$Elle$821$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"A Bobber and control meter will appear while in manual fishing mode. The meter changes based on the fish being caught,and the bobber will move. If the meter stays blue, you're doing great, but once it turns yellow it means the fish is pulling free. Red means the line will snap."#M119020$Elle$821$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"There are two additional bars at the top left of the Fishing Interface. The lower one refers to the durability of your fishing rod while the upper one shows your fish's endurance. If the bobber is over the yellow area, the rod's durability will drop. If it runs out completely, you'll lose your catch."#M119020$Elle$821$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"However, if your fish's endurance runs out before that happens, the fish is yours!"#M119020$Elle$821$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"While you fish, the bobber moves constantly. To control it, hold down the left-mouse button over the large fish icon; the bobber will shift to the right. Do your best to keep the bobber in the blue area!"#M119020$Elle$821$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"If the bobber stays in the red area for more than three seconds, your line will snap and the fish will get away."#M119020$Elle$821$1#

#&7$Elle##br#
"One last thing to note: You won't get a bite every time you cast. The biggest thing about fishing is having patience.#npc$$821$1#

@reminds you of something that happened a long time ago... #br#
@Oh well! Time to catch some River Crabs!#char$$828$0#|
20983|#&7$Betty##br#
"Whoah! I didn't expect you to catch such a big River Crab!#br#
@It looks delicious! The children are going to love it!"#br#
@Betty smiles broadly. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Betty##br#
"I may be a full-time housewife,#br#
@but that doesn't mean I don't love fishing!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Betty##br#
"Fishing brings a family together!#br#
@If a family can't fish together, they're no family in my book!"#br#
@Betty nods sagely. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Betty##br#
"A shame most people can't understand that.#br#
@If everyone fished, I bet there'd be no more war."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Betty##br#
"I feel like I can trust you though.#br#
@Anyone who loves fishing is good in my book!"#br#
@Betty grins.#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod at Betty.#char$$806$0#

#&7$Betty##br#
"Thanks for the River Crab. You've helped a ton.#br#
@Since you helped me, how about I help you?"#br#
@Betty hands you a piece of fishing gear.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Betty##br#
"Take this with you, okay?#br#
@I'm sure you'll find a use for it.#br#
@It has seen me through tough times, so I'm sure it'll do the same for you."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take Betty's gift.#br#
@You didn't expect to learn so much from her.#char$$822$0#|
20984|Old Betty's fishing fare today is far from ideal. Catch a River Crab to help her.

Speak with Fishing Family Mother Betty after catching the River Crab.|
20991|#&7$Baird##br#
"I'm still in shock over how much ground we've lost in this battle in such a short amount of time..."#br##br#
#&53$Baird anxiously scrutinizes his new reports.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Baird to brief you on the current situation.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Baird##br#
"Simply put, we're in a bit of a standstill! A strong Lion's Roar Army base occupies the front lines. With that there, Black Tooth City should be easy to take, but it's turning out to be a far more difficult operation than anticipated."#br#
#&53$Baird gazes out at the mountain stronghold.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"%n%, you're one of us, a proud member of Ventos Prairie. It is your obligation to help us!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"No matter what happens, Black Tooth City must fall! The king can't afford any setbacks in this battle!"#npc$$824$1#|
20992|#&7$Mummer##br#
"The Lion's Roar Army will not retreat one single step!"#npc$$824$1#|
20993|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Brave warriors, now is not the time to fall back or falter! We will defend this stronghold with our last breath!"#br##br#
#&53$Mummer paces as he calmly yet firmly barks orders to his soldiers.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You interrupt Mummer to inform him about your knowledge of the situation and that you have come here to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"I didn't think I'd actually see you back here so soon, %n%. I hate to say it, but we really could use your help out here."#br##br#
#&53$Mummer's brief description of the situation proves it to be quite serious.##npc$$821$1#|
20994|Lion's Roar Army's current objective is to take Black Tooth City. However, based off of Baird's reports, the operation is more difficult than planned; they are currently at a standstill. 

 Because of this, you decide to travel to the army base in the west to help Mummer.|
21001|#&7$Mummer##br#
"Based on scout reports, I sent Shalen out to secure a relay location near Black Tooth Mountain. If we are to win this battle, that location is key."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Recently, Shalen sent a request for more troops. He's stubborn to the last; I know he wouldn't ask for help unless he really needed it, so his request worries me..." #br##br##&53$Mummer shifts a long gaze to the battle outside.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"Our enemies are not fools. I'm almost certain they attacked this area in order to isolate Shalen; my reinforcements can't get to him."#br##br#
#&53$Mummer balls his hands into fists as he speaks, his voice thick with frustration.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"%n%, I need you to make your way into enemy territory to rescue Shalen. We will do our best to clear a path for you."#npc$$822$1#|
21002|#&7$Shalen##br#
"Never give up! We all die if you do, so stay strong! Hold your ground! We will get through this!"#br##br#
#&53$Shalen shouts at his soldiers, struggling to keep them encouraged.##npc$$826$1#|
21003|#&7$Shalen##br#
"%n%, I'm so glad to see you! Now it makes sense why the enemy's front lines have thinned."#br##br#
#&53$Shalen wipes blood from his face with the back of  his hand as he grins at you with relief.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"We're managing to hold our own here for the time being, but I think Tatiana could use your help."#br##br#
#&53$Shalen casts a worried gaze towards the fortress nestled on top of the mountain.##npc$$828$1#|
21004|Shalen is guarding the hillside under Mummer's orders, but he's at risk of being overrun. 

After careful deliberation, Mummer asks you to break through the enemy's front lines to Black Tooth Mountain in order to aid Shalen.|
21011|#&7$Shalen##br#
"%n%, we need you to take some supplies up the mountain to Tatiana. She will need them to help her endure the battle that's coming."#br##br#
#&53$Shalen bites his lip as he gazes worriedly up the mountain.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"Where are those carts?!"#br##br#
#&53$Shalen whirls around to assess the progress of the soldiers preparing the supplies. Within moments they wheel up the supply cart.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Shalen##br#
"%n%, this cart needs to reach Tatiana as soon as possible. The road to the fortress is overrun with enemy soldiers, so you'll have to fight your way there. I'll have a small band of troops accompany you to help you through that gauntlet. We cannot fail; Tatiana needs these supplies no matter what!"#npc$$822$1#|
21012|#&7$Tatiana##br#
"We will kill them all, blood for blood! We fight under the king's banner now! Our ferocity must bleed through now more than ever!" #br##br#
#&53$Despite Tatiana's rousing speech, her words fall flat, not quite carrying through to the crowd. It is clear that she is exhausted.##npc$$826$1#|
21013|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You charge through the front lines of the fortress, the supply cart firmly in tow behind you.##char$$828$0#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"The supplies! Hurry, help %n% with the supplies!"#br##br#
#&53$Tatiana rushes to your side after she catches sight of you, nearby soldiers taking the cart from your grip.##npc$$3001$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"I don't know why, but every time I see you I am filled with hope. This is just like old times, you and me fighting shoulder-to-shoulder."#br##br#
#&53$She grins at you with elation and relief.##npc$$821$1#|
21014|Shalen, the one in charge of holding the relay base, has given you the task of delivering a cart of supplies to Tatiana in the mountain base. She relies on your battle prowess to succeed in the mission, the fortress currently under attack.

The Blacktooth werewolves swarming the area won't let you pass so easily, so do your best to protect the cart. Do not allow them to destroy it.|
21021|#&7$Tatiana##br#
"It honors me to fight by your side, %n%. Let me bring you up to speed with the situation."#br##br#
#&53$Tatiana unrolls a map in front of you.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"This is where we are, next to a powerful elite force that must be eliminated. Whatever resistance you have faced up to this point, it will be far more intense from here on out."#br##br#
#&53$As Tatiana speaks, she points to a few locations on the map.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"Our goal is to destroy the enemy's artillery troop here; they are currently swarming the Carrion Barrier."#br##br#
#&53$Tatiana reaches across the map to a specific location.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"Take this flag. Once you've taken the Barrier, raise it there. We will do our best to hold back the worst of the resistance while you carry out the  mission."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tatiana##br#
"Make sure that my husband knows of the flag once it's raised; he'll know that I've completed the mission and delivered honor to his name."#br##br#
#&53$With a grim expression, Tatiana presses the flag into your hands.##npc$$822$1#|
21022|&7$Odum##br#
"Tatiana...I knew I shouldn't have sent her out there..."#br##br#
#&53$Odum's brow creases with worry as he frets over Tatiana's safety.##npc$$828$1#|
21023|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Once you've reached the Lion's Roar Army strategic base, you explain to Odum the situation on the  mountain. He lifts his head to gaze at the flag billowing in the distance.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Odum##br#
"Warriors, take heart! Our flag waves amid the chaos! The time to take the Black Tooth City is now! For the king, for the Makar!"#br##br#
#&53$Odum roars this battle cry for every Makar warrior nearby.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Odum##br#
"That's my Tatiana..."#br##br#
#&53$When Odum gazes at the flag again, it is with beaming pride.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You also gaze at the flag waving in the wind, the symbol of the alliances you've helped to forge with your hard work. Nearby soldiers cry out in celebration. The tides of war have changed in your favor.##char$$806$0#|
21024|In this important battle objective, you must destroy the artillery troop currently bombarding the Carrion Barrier as quickly as possible. Then, take the flag that Tatiana gave you and raise in in the mountain fortress. 

Once you are finished, report back to Odum.|
21031|#&7$Odum##br#
"Things may be brightening now, but I don't know how long it'll last. Based on my experience, I don't know how long this advantage can last... The Dark Legion must already know of their setback. We must prepare for their backlash; we have to figure out a way to avoid the Scourge Artillery." #br#
#&53$Odum Ryan gazes out towards the Dark Legion Base, his expression darkening with worry.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Suddenly, the sound of cannon fire crackles through the air as flashes of light streak across the sky. The Dark Legion has already begun to fight back!##char$$1901$0#

#&7$Odum##br#
"Oh no... there isn't much time! Hurry, report back to Baird! Whatever you do, he must receive this!"#br##br#
#&53$Anxiously, Odum pushes a battle report into your hands.##npc$$825$1#|
21032|#&7$Baird##br#
"Recruits, bring out that gear over there! You there, that cart better be full the next time I turn around!"#br##br#
#&53$Baird anxiously commands the new recruits with a firm show of confidence.##npc$$821$1#|
21033|#&7$Baird##br#
"It fired again, didn't it."#br##br#
#&53$Baird stares grimly out at the mountain fortress.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Determined not to waste time, you describe the situation as you thrust the report towards Baird.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Baird##br#
"This battle is beyond anything I imagined it to be... history is in the making as we speak..."#br##br#
#&53$Baird's searching gaze rolls over the battle report.##npc$$825$1#|
21034|Once the Black Legion learned that Black Tooth City had fallen from their control, they responded with a barrage of cannon fire.

Bolstered by the success of the fight so far, you are ordered to take Odum's battle report to Baird in Carrion Barrier.|
21041|#&7$Kara##br#
"Good to see you again, %n%!"#br##br#
#&53$Kara greets you with a warm smile.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"The Hunter's Village has received word from the Church; they want us to prepare for the upcoming battle. The village has received a lot of help from the Church already, but I'm still worried. I can't just sit idly by."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"Despite my insecurities, I have complete faith in the battle competence of our youth. They grew up in hard times, so they know what it means to fight for what they've got. Some of their battle skills have surpassed the skills of some of the Church's soldiers. Of course, we will all be at the front lines to do our part in protecting this world."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"My son, Dallan, and the Stone Hammer Tribe's  chief, Amon, have formed a volunteer army that is currently garrisoned at the Joint Operation Camp to the southwest. Please help me out by checking in on them; I'll feel a lot better knowing that you are there."#npc$$2$1#|
21042|#&7$Rachel##br#
"With everyone giving it their all, I'll do my best, too! After all, I'm a woman of the Hunter's Village!"#br##br#
#&53$Rachel wipes the sweat from her forehead as she speaks.##npc$$2$1#|
21043|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$As you approach the Joint Operation Camp, you see everyone hard at work. Even the best hunters are present, preparing their gear for the war.##char$$806$0#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"So we meet again, %n%. There's so much to do around here that it's a wonder I can even remember to breathe!"#br##br#
#&53$Rachel takes a glance around, looking quite exhausted.##npc$$821$1#|
21044|The hunters from Triatio Highlands have decided to lend their services to the upcoming war. Their leader, Kara, is with them at Carrion Barrier. 

Because she knows that this will be a tough fight, she asks you to go to the Joint Operation Camp to check on Dallan.|
21045|#&7$Dallan##br#
"I want to make sure everything in this camp is ready before Tanner and Amon get back." #br##br#
#&53$Dallan mutters to himself as he calculates what there is left to prepare at the camp.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You squeeze in a quick greeting before asking Dallan about the current situation. If there's any way you can help, you're all over it!##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"It's the same issue it's always been: our defenses are stretched thin. Rachel is overseeing construction and maintenance, but we never have enough helping hands. Could you do me a favor and go check up on her for me?"#br#
#&53$Dallan pats you on the shoulder, smiling encouragingly.##npc$$821$1#|
21051|#&7$Rachel##br#
"Ah, there you are! I could really use your help around here. Take a look at that."#br#
#&53$Rachel points to the barricade surrounding the camp.##br#
I don't think that barricade could withstand another attack."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"It doesn't help that the arrows the Sarpa shoot are dipped in a corrosive poison. Without those barricades, we don't stand a chance out here."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"There is some lumber in the storage area around back. I would love it if you could repair the barricade for me."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Rachel##br#
"Once you're done with that, check to see if there is anything you can help Dallan with. I know you'd rather fight, but it would improve our chances if this barricade is fixed first."#npc$$827$1#|
21052|#&7$Dallan##br#
"We seem to be holding up, if barely... maybe we can actually keep the Dark Legion back..."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan looks around pensively.##npc$$827$1#|
21053|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$There! The barricades are finished! You find Dallan to report your progress and to ask if there is anything you can do to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"When will Rachel learn that our best warrior is not destined to be a laborer!"#br##br#
#&53$Dallan flashes you an apologetic smile.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"Well, I'm glad you're back. I need you to help me with a little situation."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan gazes in the direction of the Sarpa Army base - the Toxic Fortress.##npc$$825$1#|
21054|Sarpa arrows tipped with corrosive poison are eating away at the camp's barricades, risking the area of attack. 

Under Rachel's request, you must fix the barricade in order to improve the camp's defenses.|
21061|#&7$Dallan##br#
"As you can see, we are locked into heavy battle with the Sarpa. We need to push back their forces and gain the advantage."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan points at an unrolled map on the table beside him.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"We can only do so much, so I need you to go to the front lines to meet with Tanner and Amon. Help them contain the situation."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"On your way there, take down any Sarpa you see. Fighting alongside the soldiers will boost their morale, and each less Sarpa to kill only makes the situation easier on all of us."#npc$$826$1#|
21062|#&7$Amon##br#
"Cretins! You dare to challenge me?!"#br#
#&53$Amon viciously swings his axe, slicing through several enemies at once.##npc$$2012$1#|
21063|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After a violent struggle, you eventually make it into the camp to find Amon and his soldiers. Battle saturates the area; the outcome does not look promising.##char$$2$0#

#&7$Amon##br#
"%n%...what are you doing here?"#br#
#&53$Breathless from fighting, Amon glances at you in surprise.##npc$$1001$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Quickly, so as not to distract Amon too much, you explain your situation. He gestures with a nod of his head in the opposite direction.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Amon##br#
"If you can take out that monster over there, that would be swell."#br##br#
#&53$Amon swings his axe again, mindful not to hit you with it.##npc$$1011$1#|
21064|The volunteer army's main objective is to control the Sarpa invasion, but it looks like they are losing that battle.

Dallan asks you to fight your way into the Toxic Fortress to help Tanner and Amon.|
21065|#&7$Tanner##br#
"Ha-ha, that's right, c'mon, you lousy fish-brains!"#br##br#
#&53$Tanner's taunting enrages the nearby Sarpa.##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"There you are, %n%, you just missed all the fun! I just finished chopping down two rather burly-looking Sarpa at once!"#br##br#
#&53$Tanner grins, his eyes wide from the excitement of battle.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$One quick glance is enough for you to know that Tanner has everything under control. You still ask for help; might as well not waste a trip.##char$$806$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Help? You're talking to the wrong man! Everything's just peachy here. Working with Amon really does help matters. Speaking of which..."#br##br#
#&53$Tanner takes a glance towards the fortress.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"I'm actually worried about the big guy. He just charged in there without a second thought. How about you go see how he's doing? I would sure hate to lose him to these lame-brains."#br##br#
#&53$Tanner snickers at his own remark.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Alright, you lousy fish-brains, come at me! You don't stand a chance against me!"#br##br#
#&53$Tanner launches himself back into the heat of battle.##npc$$3001$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Since your help doesn't seem to be needed here, you decide to take Tanner's suggestion and go find Amon. Perhaps you'll be of better use there.##char$$806$0#|
21071|#&7$Amon##br#
"I recently heard the Sarpa Warpriest's war-cry, which summoned a Deepsea Monstrosity."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Amon##br#
"This has made an already terrible situation worse. I can't fight against that sea creature; it blocks every single one of our attacks."#br##br#
#&53$Amon grits his teeth, snarling in frustration.##npc$$501$1#

#&7$Amon##br#
"Tanner thinks I'm practically invincible, the fool. I know you can succeed where I would fail; slay the monster and make sure all these minions know about it. While you're at it, you might as well take down some of those Priests, too."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Amon##br#
"Those Sarpa will tremble right out of their scales when they see their precious weapon slain!"#br##br#
#&53$Amon chuckles as he pictures the sight.##npc$$2012$1#

#&7$Amon##br#
"You think your puny self can handle all that?"#br##br#
#&53$Amon thrusts a heavy iron shield out in front of you.##npc$$1$1#|
21072|#&7$Amon##br#
"Soldiers, prepare yourselves! %n% is about to engage in battle with the Deepsea Monstrosity! We must clear a path for the Envoy of Gaia!"#br##br#
#&53$The warriors immediately file into action upon Amon's orders.##npc$$1$1#|
21073|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Proudly, you report to Amon of the Deepsea Monstrosity's defeat. What an invigorating battle!##char$$821$0#

#&7$Amon##br#
"I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: I'm afraid of octopi. I'm so glad that thing is gone. You better not breathe a word of this to Tanner, you understand?"#br##br#
#&53$Amon's expression suddenly grows dark as he gazes directly into your eyes.##npc$$1$1#|
21074|The Sarpa Warpriest has summoned a Deepsea Monstrosity to aid them in battle. For whatever reason, Amon cannot even scratch the beast.

At his request, you take on the challenge to slay the Sarpa priest and the monstrosity, leaving the carcass as a warning to other foes.|
21081|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The sound of a distant war horn breaks the rhythm of battle. It seems as though it is coming from the Joint Operation Camp.##char$$823$0#

#&7$Amon##br#
"That signal's coming from our side... our mission here is done. TROOPS, FALL BACK!"#br##br#
#&53$Amon's bellowing command captures the attention of every soldier within earshot; they instantly obey, abandoning their positions to retreat.##npc$$2012$1#

#&7$Amon##br#
"%n%, you should leave as well. Deliver the news to Tanner; tell him that we've withdrawn according to plan. We'll reinforce later."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Amon##br#
"Tanner will give you bombardment coordinates for the artillery. He better not have gotten them wrong again!"#br##br#
#&53$Amon turns away, his cue that you should find Tanner.##npc$$2$1#|
21082|#&7$Kara##br#
"A scout has observed a change in the situation at the Toxic Fortress. I suspect you had something to do with this? Tell me what happened."#npc$$821$1#|
21083|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Kara's eyes narrow as she gazes out at the Sarpa's stronghold while you report the news.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kara##br#
"I doubt any of this has stopped the Sarpa. If anything, it has only made this skirmish worse."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kara##br#
"However, I have to keep positive. We needed this victory. It's apparent that we cannot win this war without your help. We need you, %n%."#npc$$822$1#|
21084|The call of a war horn marks the end of the task to hold back the enemy forces. Amon asks you to inform Tanner that his troops have withdrawn according to battle plan.

Make sure you get the artillery coordinates from Tanner and deliver them to Dallan so that he can prepare the cannons. Then you need to report the current situation to Kara at Carrion Barrier.|
21085|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Tanner that the signal for retreat has sounded; Amon has already withdrawn, so he must as well.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Don't worry, I was going to do it anyway. Does Amon think I'm stupid or something? Of course I would remember to withdraw!"#br##br#
#&53$Tanner grumbles under his breath as he shoves a Sarpa corpse out of his way with the heel of his boot.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Tanner##br#
"Here are the artillery coordinates, just as Mr. Secretary said. Take them to Dallan at the camp; he'll know what to do with them."#br##br#
#&53$Tanner pushes a piece of parchment in your hands, still grumbling to himself.##npc$$822$1#|
21086|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Dallan the information while informing him about the situation at the Toxic Fortress, hoping he's in a better mood to receive your news than Tanner had been.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Dallan##br#
"Perfect, I've been waiting for this! It looks like you're a key component to this war, %n%; your work is paying off. Please tell my mother, Kara, about the current situation."#br##br#
#&53$Dallan scans through the list, moving to begin artillery preparations.##npc$$822$1#|
21091|#&7$Camilla##br#
"Every day there are more wounded soldiers. It's beginning to be too much; if I can't keep up with their care, their condition will worsen."#br#
#&53$Frazzled, Camilla frantically rummages through her medical supplies, her face pale with stress and exhaustion.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"%n%, you have no idea how relieved I am to see you. I'm so short-staffed, it's not even funny. Not like it ever was, but... anyway, could you please help me administer these healing agents to the patients?"#br#
#&53$Camilla gestures to the emergency ward crowded with wounded soldiers awaiting treatment.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"This medicine is from the Makar. As healing potions, they work wonders, but they sometimes come with strange and unpredictable side-effects."#br##br#
#&53$Camilla passes a bottle of the potion to you.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"Study each patient as you administer the drug. If you see any side-effects, act immediately to remedy the situation. I would hate to lose any of our soldiers to this medicine's side-effects, but if I don't give it to them they'll die anyway."#npc$$827$1#|
21092|#&7$Camilla##br#
"New wounded soldiers just keep pouring in! I don't know how I'm going to keep up with all of this..."#npc$$828$1#|
21093|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Being a nurse is exhausting work! After treating a few patients, you update Camilla on your progress, then wearily return to work.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"I'm lucky to have you here, and so is every soldier in this building. I don't know how we would cope without you."#br#
#&53$Camilla flashes a smile, then turns to continue working; she seems a little less stressed and more focused than before. Things seem to be calming down here.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Camilla##br#
"I think I can take it from here, %n%. I know there are a lot of other people around here that could really use your help. With you around, I know we can win this war!"#npc$$821$1#|
21094|There are many soldiers in need of healing, and not enough nurses to heal them. Camilla has asked you to administer the Makar's healing potion to the soldiers in the emergency ward.

Despite this medicine being more effective, it comes with side-effects. Keep a watchful eye on the patients; if they incur strange symptoms, treat them right away.|
21101|#&7$Juno##br#
"It's just about time to restock the strongholds again..." #br##br#
#&53$Juno leans against the supply cart for a much-needed break.##npc$$2$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"Not sure how useful you'll be, %n%, but if you're lookin' for something to do, this cart full of supplies needs to visit each army camp for restocking."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"My helping hands are all off on assignment right now, so it's just been me, myself and I delivering all of these supplies. A man can only do so much. If you could deliver those supplies to the front lines, that would be fantastic."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"This box here is goin' to the Lion's Roar Army Base. This next one should head on over to the volunteer encampment. Finally, this box needs to make its way to the assault force in Drowsy Glen." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"What each camp needs is different, so try not to mix up the supplies, alright?"#npc$$822$1#|
21102|#&7$Juno##br#
"I'm worn out from exhaustion, but I'd still rather do this than be out there fightin'..."#br##br#
#&53$With a weary groan, Juno resumes in loading items in the cart.##npc$$2$1#|
21103|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Juno about successfully delivering the supplies.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Juno##br#
"Huh... looks like you're pretty useful around here after all. Imagine that. Maybe I'll even get a shot at a decent break now."#br#
#&53$Weak from exhaustion, Juno can barely keep his own head up, much less walk without dragging his feet.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Juno##br#
"I'm sure there are other folks around here who could use a hand. If you've got the energy for it, go see what they're up to."#br##br#
#&53$With a yawn, Juno drowsily nods his head to you in thanks.##npc$$822$1#|
21104|With events of the war keeping everyone busy, Juno is short-handed with important supplies that need to be delivered.

You decide to help Juno deliver the supplies to three army encampments outside of the Barrier.|
21105|#&7$Mummer##br#
"At last, provisions! I thought they'd never get here! You, over there! Help %n% carry these things in!"#br##br#
#&53$An excited Mummer barks off orders to a few nearby recruits.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mummer##br#
"That must have been a difficult journey. Send my thanks to the logistics team."#br##br#
#&53$Without another word, Mummer turns, calling out more orders while scanning through his battle notes.##npc$$822$1#|
21106|#&7$Dallan##br#
"%n%! Now you're delivering supplies! Is there anything you can't do? Just set that down over there, I'll fetch someone to take it in."#npc$$821$1#|
21107|#&7$Anya##br#
"%n%, you don't know how much this means to us; you are in our debt. Thank you."#br##br#
#&53$Anya turns to call out for someone to carry the supplies inside.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I knew I would receive the goods eventually. I didn't expect you would be the one to deliver them, though. I don't think I can thank you enough for your continued selflessness."#npc$$822$1#|
21111|#&7$Merle##br#
"Does anyone here know how to operate a chipper? Chipper operator wanted! Are there any chipper operators out there?"#br##br#
#&53$You watch Merle drift from person to person, asking each one for assistance.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"Oh, %n%! Fancy seeing you here! Say, do you know how to operate a Chipper, per chance?"#br##br#
#&53$Merle pins you with a hopeful smile.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"We're stationed at the Logging Camp southeast of here. The dwarves have delivered us a few of their newest Chippers, but no one knows how to operate them!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"I've seen you pilot dwarven machinery before, so I'm hoping you can  help me with this. If you think you can and if you're interested, talk to Wilson at the Logging Camp. He'll get you all set up."#npc$$823$1#|
21112|#&7$Merle##br#
"Is there anyone here who can pilot a Chipper? If you can, please sign your name on this clipboard!"#br##br#
#&53$Merle is still searching for more Chipper operators.##npc$$821$1#|
21113|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You inform Merle that you have finished all the tasks Wilson had for you. Is there anything else you can do around here?##char$$821$0#

#&7$Merle##br#
"Oh, nice! Thanks, %n%! I didn't manage to find any more chipper operators, but I think the lumber you gathered should be enough to last us a good while."#br##br#
#&53$Merle looks around, tapping the tip of her pen against her chin as she thinks of something you could do.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Merle##br#
"Well, I do remember someone saying that the blacksmith is looking for assistants. Maybe you can talk to Shep for something to do?"#npc$$821$1#|
21114|The Dwarves seemed to have forgotten that humans aren't quite up to speed with their technology - there is no one to pilot the new Chippers!

Fortunately, you have enough experience with Dwarven machinery to be able to lend a hand at the Logging Camp.|
21115|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$The Logging Camp is well-stocked with brand-new Chippers, the tags still on them. The place, however, is void of operators to control them.##char$$2$0#

#&7$Wilson##br#
"So you're the pilot Merle dug out of the woodwork. Alright, hurry and strap yourself into one of those machines. Pick any one you like, they're all the same, and fire it up."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Wilson##br#
"Your task is to guide a Chipper into the forest and chop down some trees there. Just watch out for those Game Birds; they're pesky critters."#br##br#
#&53$Wilson nods.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Wilson##br#
"The Chipper itself may be complicated, but at least its defense system is pretty basic. Use it to drive away the Game Birds that try to attack you. The Chipper seems real good at letting you know when there's approaching danger."#npc$$822$1#|
21121|#&7$Shep##br#
"What do you mean, our metal reserves are gone?! What about the logistics team?! Why can't they bring more?!"#br##br#
#&53$You are glad you are not the soldier taking the brunt of Shep's anger.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Shep##br#
#&53$Shep continues to scream at the soldier until he's had enough. Once dismissed, the new recruit scurries off in a fluster, leaving Shep to grumble and pace, clearly still unhappy.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Shep##br#
"Why is finding good help so difficult these days? I can't believe we're now reduced to collecting scrap metal from the battle field."#br##br#
#&53$Shep sighs as he pauses to glance at his depleted metal reserves, then lifts his gaze once he notices you there.##npc$$829$1#

#&7$Shep##br#
"Oh, %n%, come in! You... weren't standing there long, were you? I've hired soldiers - SOLDIERS!- that are too gutless to go out to the battle field to collect scrap metal! I know you won't let me down, though. Could you go out there and collect a few bits of metal for me? It's for those gutless soldiers' armor."#npc$$828$1#|
21122|#&7$Shep##br#
"I cannot believe how terrible the supply shortage has been since this war started."#br##br#
#&53$Shep sighs, shaking his head dejectedly.##npc$$828$1#|
21123|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You pass over to Shep all the scrap metal you managed to collect.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Shep##br#
"Looks like you are more help than any support soldier could ever be."#br##br#
#&53$Shep grins as he looks over the metal you've brought in.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shep##br#
"All of these pieces are good. This will help me immensely!"#br##br#
#&53$Shep grows more excited as he examines each piece more closely.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Relieved that he isn't screaming at you, you inform Shep that you are happy to help, then you hesitantly ask if there is anything else you can do.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Shep##br#
"I know Kali could use a hand with a few things. He came here looking for you, in fact. Go find him, ask him what he wants."#npc$$821$1#|
21124|Nothing pushes armor production like a war. Problem is, there is not enough metal to go around.

As a result, you decide to help Shep collect pieces of scrap metal from the battlefield. This metal could be reforged into fine armor once more.|
21131|#&7$Kali##br#
"%n%! Where are you when I need you the most?? You're the only one who can help me mix potions properly. If you don't hurry up, I'll never get this list of medicines made on time." 
#&53$Kali shakes a test tube in one hand, dropping ingredients in a pot with the other. ##npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You walk up to Kali, gently tap her shoulder, and ask how you can help. ##char$$821$0#

#&7$Kali##br#
"You're here at last! Where have you been?" 
#&53$Kali's face brightened into a radiant grin. #
"Well, there are a few medicinal ingredients here. Listen carefully, and put the correct ingredient into the pot." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kali##br#
"We cannot get the process or sequence of ingredients wrong in the slightest way, or the potion will not have the desired effect. It may even become toxic!" 
#&53$Kali cautions. ##npc$$2$1#|
21132|#&7$Kali##br#
"I've just been on my feet too long..." #br#
says Kali, stretching his limbs out and giving them a shake. #npc$$2$1#|
21133|#&7$%n%##br#
You give Kali a bottle of the finished potion to inspect. #char$$806$0#

#&7$Kali##br#
"Hmm... well, it passes the taste test, no problems there. Nothing looks odd about it, either... #br#
We'll let this potion sit for a bit before trying it on one of the patients." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Kali##br#
"I knew someone would come to my aid eventually. Thank you, %n%. #br#
If you have more spare time, remember to come back again and help me cook up more potions!" #br#
Kali exclaims. #npc$$824$1#|
21134|The Makar do not normally give their medicines to those not of their kind. However, since you previously helped Kali with many issues in Ventos Prairie, you've earned her trust.

For this task, however, you must follow Kali's instructions and add the correct ingredients to the medicine pot. The slightest divergence from the recipe could cause the potion to completely lose its effect.|
21141|#&7$Chaim##br#
"%n%, you came just in time. #br#
I thought I'd never find anyone to help!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You ask Chaim what had happened. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Chaim##br#
"Well, the Pioneers are planning to parachute from Black Tooth City.
They feel that, in doing so, they can break up the enemy's line of defense from behind. #br#
Unfortunately, you've gotta be pretty darn skilled to parachute in, and not many people fit the bill." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Chaim##br#
"I'd join in this battle myself if I only had the strength! #br#
You wouldn't catch me waiting around here 'til doomsday, that's for sure." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Chaim##br#
"%n%, I think you might be the perfect fit for the job.#br#
As strong as you are, I think this'll be a cakewalk! #br#
Would you please lend us a hand?" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Chaim##br#
"You'll find the raiding party atop the platform at the highest point of Black Tooth City. #br#
They'll talk you through the whole battle plan. #br#
Set off as soon as possible! Don't delay! The enemy could discover the plan at any moment!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
This
 Quest is a Team Quest, so it is significantly more difficult. We recommend that you attempt it in a Party. #char$$1$0#|
21142|#&7$Robinson##br#
"Watch out for the Dark Legion Soldiers! Don't let them see you!" #br#
Robinson admonishes the soldiers behind him. #npc$$827$1#|
21143|#&7$Robinson##br#
"%n%, that was an impressively graceful landing! #br#
Looks like you'd make a good paratrooper, too!" #npc$$824$1#|
21144|The frontlines are locked in a stalemate. Chaim wants you to lend your support. You'll have to get all the details from Anya.

Go support the frontlines. Meet with Anya, and ask what strategy she has in mind.|
21145|#&7$Anya##br#
"It's taken us enormous effort to gain even a foot in this foolish war, and here we are, languishing at an impasse. #br#
The struggle to keep us fed and equipped has been almost as great a burden as fighting our foes." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"We cannot go on this way. We must break the stalemate!" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I'm planning to send out a squad of elite troops #br#
to parachute from the highlands into the Demon Army's stronghold. #br#
At
 the same time, the cavalry will circle around and attack them both from 
here and from the rear." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"If all goes according to plan, #br#
this course of action will wipe out the Demon soldiers from the valley in one fell swoop!" #npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod in understanding, #br#
and you ask Anya where you can be of assistance. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"The Elite Squad is already poised to move. #br#
Follow them, and parachute into the Demon stronghold. #br#
Rendezvous there with Robinson's squad." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I have great faith in your strength, but I must remind you nevertheless: #br#
this mission is highly dangerous. #br#
You and your group must exercise extreme caution once you are deep within the enemy's camp." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"If you believe you are ready, speak with Hermione on the high platform to be briefed on the parachuting procedures." #npc$$825$1#|
21146|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You relate what you learned from Chaim to Hermione, hoping she can explain the battle plan in more detail. ##char$$821$0#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"I see. Well, in that case, let me tell you what you'll need to know about parachuting." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"Before us lies the Dark Legion Base. We'll use this high terrain to our advantage to make our glide in. We need to land in the empty area just behind the enemy army's camp. There may be Sentry Troopers nearby, though, so we'll have to look for cover as soon as we touch ground." #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"Squad Leader Robinson has already led his small team of Elite Soldiers there. After landing, you'll have to rendezvous with him immediately." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Hermione##br#
"The others have taken off already. You must hurry! Don't get left behind! Bon voyage, %n%, godspeed, and all that!" #npc$$822$1#|
21151|#&7$Robinson##br#
"For those who've just arrived, let me just sum up. Listen closely now, all of you." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Not far up ahead is the Demons' portal. This portal leads into their world. The soldiers of the Dark Legion continuously surge through. We must destroy the Teleport Gate, thus cutting off their reinforcements." #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"One squad must distract the Dark Gate Guards while the other squad plants a bomb in front of the Gate. Is that understood?"#br##br# 
#&53$Robinson looks over the assembled soldiers, meeting each person's eyes briefly. ##npc$$827$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"%n%, you're in charge of bringing down the leader of the Guards. Without a leader, the Demons will become confused and disoriented. That should help us complete the mission." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$This Quest is a Team Quest, so it is significantly more difficult. We recommend that you attempt it in a Party.##char$$1$0#|
21152|#&7$Robinson##br#
"If anyone has any questions about the plan, speak now, or forever hold your peace!" #npc$$821$1#|
21153|#&7$Robinson##br#
"Good work, %n%! #br#
We've blown up the Teleport Gate! Our foes will have a lot of trouble calling for backup now!" #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Now onto the next stage of the plan..." #npc$$827$1#|
21154|You've succeeded in destroying the Teleport Gate. Reinforcements for the Dark Legion can no longer reach the area. Robinson requests that you advance to the vicinity of the Demon Arsenal. Rendezvous there with Walter to begin the next stage of the plan.

Go find Walter near the Demon Arsenal.|
21161|#&7$Robinson##br#
"Earlier, I sent Werner and a few members of the Assault Squad to sneak into the enemy camp. #br#
Our plan is part Demolition and part Pincer Attack. #br#
If my tactical deductions are correct, #br#
we should then be able to halt the Dark Legion's advance." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"According to my analysis of the situation, the enemy has not yet discovered our position. #br#
Thus, I need you to ambush the enemy's camp; strike while the iron is hot! #br#
Kill the Artillerymen, and destroy all their weapons, too. #br#
This should take a lot of pressure off of Anya." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Once
 you've set off, I'll take some of my soldiers around the back and start
 a commotion to divert attention away from you. #br#
When you're done, find Werner. #br#
I'll figure out a way to finish the battle." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Robinson##br#
"Any questions? No? Good. Let's move out." #br#
Robinson and his soldiers grasp their weapons, #br#
narrowing their eyes. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
This
 Quest is a Team Quest, so it is significantly more difficult. We recommend that you attempt it in a Party.#char$$1$0#|
21162|#&7$Werner##br#
"That accursed Scourge Artillery! Each time they fire, they slay countless soldiers." #br#
Werner gnashes his teeth, eyes fixed on the cannons. #npc$$826$1#|
21163|#&7$%n%##br#
After you have destroyed the Dark Legion's artillery down to the last cannon, #br#
go to the location provided by Robinson to find Werner and his companions. #char$$2$0#

#&7$Werner##br#
"You took down their entire Artillery Unit like a one man army!" #br#
Werner exclaims with a bright grin, clapping with glee. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Werner##br#
"That only leaves the last stage of our battle plan..." #br#
Werner raises an eyebrow at you as he fires a signal flare into the sky. #npc$$827$1#|
21164|To destroy the Scourge Artillery that prevents Anya's army
 from attacking, Robinson wants you to sneak into the Dark Legion Base 
with a small unit and destroy as much of the enemy's artillery as 
possible.

Once that's accomplished, rendezvous with Werner to prepare for the next step of the plan.|
21171|#&7$Werner##br#
"Commander Anya surely saw the signal to proceed with her Pincer Attack," #br#
Werner mumbles, gazing up at the flare.

#&7$Werner##br#
"Keep your spirits high! Double-check that equipment! #br#
Be ready to engage in the Pincer Attack with Commander Anya," #br#
barks Warner to his soldiers. #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Werner##br#
"%n%, I'm allocating some target buildings to you to destroy." #br#
Werner carefully hands you some weighty explosives. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Werner##br#
"Your objective is to take care of those guards #br#
and destroy the enemy's Arsenal, Artillery Foundry, and Armory. #br#
Meanwhile, we'll commence the attack on the enemy army to divert their attention." #npc$$826$1#

"Don't let a single one escape. Company, forward!" #br#
Anya orchestrates the slow advance of her troops with expert precision. #npc$$827$1#|
21173|#&7$Anya##br#
"%n%, you're made it through in one piece!" #br#
Anya calls out brightly, wiping freshly spattered Demon blood from her face. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You explain to Anya what happened with Robinson, Werner, and the others. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I understand. You have done impressively well. #br#
If it hadn't been for you, I sincerely don't know what we would have done," #br#
says Anya, a hint of sadness in her voice as she pats your shoulder. #npc$$825$1#|
21174|Werner and his soldiers will ambush the Dark Legion from behind. This should 
provide you with an opportunity to go in and carry out your demolition 
strike.

Your bombs will target the enemies' most crucial facilities. You'd better make sure to completely level them!|
21181|#&7$%n%##br#
A signal flare shines far off in the sky. #br#
Anya looks at it quizzically, then shakes her head. #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Well, it looks like this wave of advancement has come to an end," #br#
Anya comments, watching the slow progress of the frontline. #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"That's Robinson's signal. #br#
It means he's already met up with Werner and now wants to withdraw from the enemy's camp. #br#
Meanwhile... those sinister Demons have already repaired the Dark Gate." #br#
With that, Anya fires another flare up into the sky. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"I've just given Robinson permission to retreat. #br#
Please take this battle report to Intelligence Volunteer Chaim for me. #br#
He will, in turn, submit my report to Andre, the Templar Commander.
After that, well... get some rest. This war will persist for some time yet." #npc$$822$1#

I'd like to show off my battle prowess and flex my muscles, too! Er, if I had any real muscles to speak of, that is..." #npc$$829$1#|
21183|#&7$Chaim##br#
"%n%, you're back! And... yikes. You need a shower." #br#
Chaim smiles tightly as you realize you're covered in oozing grime and blood.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You can't resist chuckling at Chaim's expression #br#
as you hand him the document from Anya. #char$$828$0#

#&7$Chaim##br#
"I, Intelligence Volunteer Chaim, hereby confirm the receipt of this frontline battle report!" #br#
Chaim salutes you formally. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Chaim##br#
"%n%, Envoy of Gaia, we have every confidence in you, despite your current untidy appearance. #br#
For now, get some rest. But seriously, hose yourself down first." #br#
The other soldiers standing nearby salute you as you pass, though some are also pinching their nostrils discreetly. #npc$$821$1#|
21184|Although today's mission was a complete success, the Dark Legion has managed to recuperate incredibly quickly.

Anya noted many details about the battle, and she wants you to take the report back to Chaim in Carrion Barrier.|
21191|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"New intelligence has already come back from the frontlines. #br#
%n%, I need you to run an errand for me. #br#
Take these three letters, and deliver them to the camp's Central, Western and Southern Sentry Captains. #br#
While you're there, please ensure that the camp is secure, okay?" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod and take the three intelligence communiques from Lawrence. #br#
This seems important. You ought to set off straight away. #char$$806$0#|
21192|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Everything seems to have settled down a bit in the camp... #br#
I just wish I could get in on the action at the frontlines."#npc$$825$1#|
21193|#&7$%n%##br#
You deliver the intelligence report to a somewhat frantic Lawrence. #br#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Mmhmm. You don't waste any time out there, do you, %n%? #br#
I'm so relieved I can still rely on you for help at this crucial time." #npc$$822$1#|
21194|Take the
 frontline intelligence letters to the three Sentries in the temporary 
camp, and report the situation back to Lawrence.|
21195|#&7$Western Sentry Captain##br#
"%n%! It's an honor. Greetings. #br#
The situation here is fairly stable. We've had no emergencies. #br#
The supplies salvaged from Feren Village are currently being transported back. #br#
Please report this information to Logistics Officer Lawrence." #npc$$822$1#|
21196|#&7$Central Sentry Captain##br#
"%n%, it's good to see you. #br#
Nothing special to report from here in the camp. #br#
However, I will remain vigilant, lest anything unexpected arise. #br#
Would you convey all this to Logistics Officer Lawrence for me?" #npc$$822$1#|
21197|#&7$Southern Sentry Captain##br#
"%n%, be on your guard! #br#
Frequent attacks from Runic Ghosts at the Myriad Tombs to the south have been reported.
At present, the situation is under control, but it's better to be safe than sorry. 
Please report to Logistics Officer Lawrence that at the moment, we do not need reinforcements." #npc$$822$1#|
21201|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"There are still a number of soldiers searching for salvageable supplies in Feren Village. #br#
To win this conflict, #br#
we need to utilize our resources and information to their fullest extent." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Unfortunately, at present, we simply don't have the manpower to carry out support duties. #br#
Thus, those soldiers we've stationed at Feren Village are working with minimal protection. #br#
We never know when the enemy may strike, #br#
so those soldiers are aware their task could well be a suicide mission." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"I'd like you to head to Feren Village to both help with the scavenging and inspect the scene.
Once the soldiers see that you, the great %n%, have joined the battle, #br#
their morale will soar." #npc$$822$1#|
21202|#&7$Leonard##br#
"Faster, everyone! And watch your backs! #br#
The moment anyone spots a Demon, report it immediately!" shouts Leonard, a vein in his forehead throbbing angrily. #npc$$2012$1#|
21203|#&7$%n%##br#
You take the supplies you've just collected and add them to the pile beside Leonard. #br#
This gets his attention. #br#
When he turns to you, his cloudy eyes brighten, and his narrow lips turn up at the corners just slightly.#char$$507$0#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"Everyone! Look lively now! #br#
%n% has come to give us a hand! #br#
That's it, put your back into it! We're all going to make it through this alive!" #npc$$2012$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"I am so very thankful, %n%. #br#
Just showing your face here #br#
 has encouraged my soldiers more than an entire day of my motivational shouting. Though I must admit, I do enjoy a good shout!" #npc$$822$1#|
21204|You give
 the supplies you collected from Feren Village to Leonard, and the spirits
 of the other soldiers soar. Your presence reinvigorates them.|
21211|#&7$%n%##br#
"Skeleton soldiers!! Take up your arms!!" #br#
Warning shouts from the soldiers echo in your ears. #br#
In an instant, Leonard's expression darkens. #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Leonard##br#
"Blast! Just as things were going so well... #br#
Listen, everyone! Drop your work immediately! #br#
Form ranks...!" Leonard's voice booms through the area. The soldiers tense up, suddenly very alert. #npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You know exactly what you must do. #br#
You'll have to strike down the ambushing Ice Skeletons before they do any damage.#br#
Those beastly, bleached bones could cause countless casualties. #br#
The thought of impending disaster gets your blood pumping as your pulse quickens. #char$$821$0#|
21212|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"%n%, you're back! #br#
How are the salvaging operations at Feren Village progressing? #br#
How are the soldiers?" #npc$$825$1#|
21213|#&7$%n%##br#
Lawrence beams appreciatively #br#
upon hearing your report. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"We were very close to losing that team there... #br#
Now that the fighting has picked up to the south, #br#
we really couldn't have afforded another serious blow like that." #npc$$829$1#|
21214|Drive the Ice Skeletons back, and protect the Vanguard Soldiers scavenging in Feren Village!|
21221|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"A reconnaissance team patrolling to the south just sent back some startling news. #br#
Those slain from battles long ago have been stirring from their graves. #br#
The enemy has goaded their undead bodies to mount wave upon wave of attacks against us, #br#
stretching our camp's defenses to the limit." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"If we could locate the Runic Ghosts manipulated by Ghostspinners, #br#
we could halt these attacks by the undead, at least temporarily. #br#
However, these mediums lurk deep within the necropolis, #br#
and we'd have to break through the siege to the south to begin the search." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"I'd like to leave this affair in your hands again, %n%. #br#
I want you to search through the graves of the Myriad Tombs. #br#
Find the Runic Ghosts, and defeat them." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"After that, you should look for Vincent, our Scout, near the exit of the tomb corridor. #br#
He is currently attempting to track down the Ghostspinners causing all this. #br#
The survival of our camp depends on your success... at least, for now, anyway." #npc$$825$1#|
21222|#&7$Vincent##br#
"Phew... getting myself good and poisoned, then winding up working in this ghastly place... #br#
it can't be good for my health..." #npc$$828$1#|
21223|#&7$Vincent##br#
"Oh... %n%... is that you? #br#
So glad you're here to help... #br#
I don't know anyone else who could get past that pack of wild boars." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look in the direction Vincent is pointing and, lo and behold, #br#
a horde of blue boars stares back at you with beady, bloodshot eyes. #br#
They ram themselves repeatedly against the Vanguard Soldiers' barricade. Yikes. #char$$823$0#|
21224|Seek out and defeat the Runic Ghosts used as necromantic mediums. When you finish ghostbusting, find the Scout, Vincent, who is busily investigating this area.|
21231|#&7$Vincent##br#
"The Ghostspinners that manipulate these Ghosts #br#
hide above that frozen water conduit, #br#
but these crazed Ice Boars have prevented the Vanguard Soldiers from getting any further." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"The Vanguard Sorcerers levitated these wooden platforms #br#
in an attempt to create a bridge, #br#
but they just don't have the strength to carry out the mission themselves." #npc$$829$1#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"So... um, that just leaves you to complete the quest. #br#
You'll have to jump onto the platforms, #br#
traverse the wild boar herd, and kill the Ghostspinners. Piece of cake, right?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"If you get cornered by the boars, #br#
the Vanguard Sorcerers can help you escape." #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Vincent##br#
"When you've finished the task, hurry back to Lawrence. #br#
It's very hard for us to maintain contact with the camp. #br#
I'm always fearful that when I go off duty, I'll return to find something terrible has happened there." #npc$$829$1#|
21232|#&7$Lawrence##br#
"The enemy attacks on the camp have #br#
recently waned. #br#
I imagine that means you've been hard at work out there on the frontlines again, eh?" #npc$$825$1#|
21233|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Lawrence about getting past the boars and slaying the Ghostspinners. #br#
He smiles wryly at your story. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"Ingenious! #br#
Only Vincent and his men could have come up with a plan like that. #br#
All in all, though, I'd say that just about closes out this quest. #br#
I'm most grateful, %n%." #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Lawrence##br#
"However, the situation here remains volatile.#br#
If you're willing to stick around and help us some more, #br#
we could sure use you," Lawrence says, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. #npc$$825$1#|
21234|Use the 
floating platforms to cross over the boar herd and kill the Ghostspinners skulking above the water conduit. Afterward, head back to the temporary 
camp, and report to Lawrence.|
21241|#&7$Selena##br#
"Come now! Enough of that. See here, #br#
you're not a pirate anymore, you know, #br#
yet you still act like such a brute, going about your business so carelessly. #br#
Is that what you want to do with you life? Just throw it away and wave about a bottle of rum?" #npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Selena dresses the wounds of a Catseye Sailor, #br#
berating him as she applies stinging antiseptic. #br#
The wounded mariner seems totally fear-stricken, #br#
but it's not clear whether he's actually in pain or just afraid of Selena. #char$$808$0#

#&7$Selena##br#
"Oh! Why, %n%! It's you! #br#
There are still so many wounded men in this camp awaiting help. #br#
Don't just stand there; lend a hand! #br#
If these foolish men are to be saved, we can never have enough help." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"These sailors were struck by Cold Energy during their combat with the Nagas. #br#
Their flesh is slowly turning to solid ice. #br#
We're going to need the Torch in the center of the camp before we can dispel the Cold Energy. #br#
I trust you know what to do, right? Thanks in advance!" #npc$$825$1#|
21242|#&7$Selena##br#
"Mac kept saying something about making amends for his past mistakes, #br#
and he agreed to track down the Nagas for the Church. #br#
That's what started all this foolishness. Couldn't he have just atoned by, say, giving alms to the poor or something?" #br#
Selena grumbles, a subtle smile playing across her lips. #npc$$827$1#|
21243|#&7$Selena##br#
"Great job, %n%.#br#
So sorry to bother you with all this, #br#
but so few people know how to properly heal the wounded. #br#
Well, not only that, but..." Selena trails off, looking into the distance. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"I heard... I heard the piteous wailing of the sailors... #br#
I just couldn't stand to hear their suffering... #br#
Well, anyway, the sooner they're cured, the better." #npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
The sailor who, not a moment ago, looked utterly terrified, #br#
now looks tenderly at Selena's troubled face with wistful longing, #br#
but this only causes her anger to erupt once again. #char$$809$0#

#&7$Selena##br#
"Hey!! What are you looking at?! #br#
That's it! The next one of you gets injured, #br#
you'll STAY injured!" #br#
The sailors scramble in every direction to avoid Selena's fury. #npc$$826$1#|
21244|Use the camp's Torch to save the sailors suffering from Cold Damage incurred in combat against the Nagas.|
21251|#&7$Selena##br#
"Hmm... there's still one more person to heal... someone quite fearless," #br#
Selena mused with a sigh. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"Mac, he's... oh, never mind. #br#
%n%, according to those wounded sailors, #br#
there's a waterfall to the northeast of the lake. #br#
The Nagas have placed a great many Totems there that spit freezing vapors." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"Those Totems give the Nagas a great advantage over the attacking sailors. #br#
Could you smash those Totems, for the sake of all those brave fighters? #br#
Oh and... well, if you would... would you go find... find..." #br#
Selena stammers, turning scarlet. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"Um, you know who I mean! #br#
Please just go see if he is in need of help of any kind! #br#
But don't, under any circumstances, tell him I sent you! Understood?" #br#
Selena asks enigmatically, her rage mounting again. #npc$$827$1#|
21252|#&7$Mac##br#
"Ready... FIRE!!! #br#
Oops, I forgot to mention aim. But you should know that! Front rank, stand down and reload!
Rear rank, take aim!" Mac commands gruffly. #npc$$826$1#|
21253|#&7$Mac##br#
"Um... %n%K is that you? #br#
Sorry to run into you at a time like this, #br#
but this battle is kind of pressing. #br#
I don't really have time to chat over tea right now, though I sure wish I had some finger sandwiches," Mac says apologetically. #npc$$828$1#|
21254|Destroy the Nagas' Ice Totems to eliminate their advantage in the lake battle.|
21261|#&7$Mac##br#
"We tracked the Nagas across the lake to this area. #br#
We were originally meant to simply report the fact that they had stopped here back to the Church, #br#
and that would have been 'Mission Accomplished' for us. #br#
But circumstances left us with no choice but to keep assailing them." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"Upon arriving here, the Nagas immediately went into battle mode. #br#
They then began performing some kind of ritual ceremony. #br#
It seemed to me that if we waited for the Church to get the message and come to our aid, #br#
it would already be too late, and the Nagas would have brought their plans to fruition." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"I've determined that #br#
we need to stop them immediately - or at the very least, delay them. #br#
That's how we ended up in this situation," says Mac with a dry smile. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Catseye Sailor##br#
"Boss - um, I mean, Captain! #br#
Another wave of Nagas is approaching!" the sailor shouts. #M122011$$821$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"Blast! Listen, Envoy of Gaia, #br#
I'll be brief. Time is of the essence. #br#
The Nagas are planning something sinister, and it revolves around the crystal pillars in the middle of the lake. I just know it! #br#
Go smash those crystals pillars - the more the better!" #npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Mac, a former dastardly pirate, seems so upstanding and noble that #br#
you feel compelled to aid him and his crew in their task. #char$$806$0#|
21262|#&7$Mac##br#
"It feels good to fight on behalf of others. #br#
I only hope I can make up for my past transgressions." #npc$$828$1#|
21263|#&7$Mac##br#
"%n%, you did a fine job. We're all in awe of your bravery. #br#
Why, you've got more in your pinky toenail than all our cannons put together!" #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"Looks like I'll have to up my game if I want to be on par with adventurers like you. #br#
Back in my days of banditry, I'd simply flee from anyone who could best me. But that's all in the past. #br#
Now that I'm responsible for protecting people, #br#
I must ensure I have the strength to actually do it!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"For now, though we've got to take care of these Nagas. #br#
Crew! Let's get a move on! #br#
We'll have Naga soup tonight!" #br#
The Catseye crew roars with pride and fervor. #npc$$826$1#|
21264|Use the Draconic Essence and Crystal Dragon Devourer in the middle of the 
lake to obtain the Draconic Essence and destroy it.|
21271|#&7$Mac##br#
"Envoy of Gaia! We're going to send up a signal flare now; #br#
hopefully, it'll catch the eyes of the defending Nagas. #br#
While their attention is diverted, #br#
get behind them, and kill the Naga Warpriests carrying out the sinister ritual." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"We'll do our best to hold off the Nagas' attack. #br#
I trust you won't keep us hanging for long. #br#
It all depends on you. Now go!" #npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Mac and the entire Catseye crew look to you solemnly, placing all of their trust in you. #br#
You nod curtly, fully ready for battle. #char$$803$0#|
21272|#&7$Mac##br#
"And... FIRE!!! #br#
Well, I never thought the new Catseye crew's first great battle would be on land! #br#
This'll be one to tell your grandkids, lads!" #br#
Mac's encouragement causes hearty laughter to ripple through the sailors. #npc$$1020$1#|
21273|#&7$Mac##br#
"Terrific! Envoy, #br#
the Nagas have begun retreating! #br#
And it's all thanks to you. #br#
I think we'll be getting a little extra gold from the Church for this commission, eh? Don't spend it all in one place!" #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"There's nothing like the feeling of victory, but all the same... #br#
I'm feeling a little nauseous at the prospect #br#
of going back to face Selena," admits Mac. You can hear his stomach gurgling and churning. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"We'd be better off riding the tide of this victory and pursuing the enemy. #br#
Eventually, though, I'll man up and face Selena. #br#
By then, perhaps she'll realize that this was no fool's errand. #br#
It was an adventure of deep consequence, and I did it for her!" #npc$$821$1#|
21274|Slay the Naga Warpriests performing their ceremony on the lake, then report back to Mac.|
21281|#&7$Mac##br#
"The Nagas have a stronghold on the highlands west of the lake. #br#
They're going to hoard their Draconic Essence there, #br#
and once they gather a certain amount, they'll ship them out." #br#
Mac peers through his telescope at the faraway Naga stronghold. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"Their camp is in disarray at the moment, though. #br#
If we strike now, while the iron is hot, #br#
I think we'll have a good chance at overwhelming them. #br#
Heck, we may even seize a well-earned chance to catch our breath." #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"%n%, I was honored to fight shoulder to shoulder with you here, #br#
but we can't head back to camp yet without first making sure the area's secure. #br#
And... well... actually... #br#
I wanted to ask you one more thing," Mac says sheepishly, shifting his feet. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Mac##br#
"After taking care of the Naga stronghold, #br#
could you return to the sailors' camp, #br#
and tell Selena... um, tell her I'll be back soon. #br#
Tell her not to be angry. I'll apologize to her properly and make it all up to her somehow. Possibly with jewelry or chocolate or both." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You can't help but find Mac's embarrassment amusing. #br#
The Catseye crew nearby snicker at their lovelorn leader.#br#
Looks like the erstwhile pillaging, plundering buccaneer is now a completely reformed man... #br#
and maybe a little whipped. #char$$825$0#|
21282|#&7$Selena##br#
"When's Mac planning to get back here?! #br#
He sputtered a few words, then ran off! #br#
I know he's a former scary ol' pirate, but I just wish he'd be a little more careful." #br#
Selena mutters distantly, wringing her hands. #npc$$829$1#|
21283|#&7$Selena##br#
"%n%! You're back! #br#
Did you find Mac? #br#
Why isn't he with you? #br#
Was he injured?" Selena asks rapid fire questions, clearly anxious.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
As Selena paces, #br#
you explain everything about Mac's situation.#br#
Upon hearing the details, Selena gives a sigh of utter relief.#char$$8230$0#

#&7$Selena##br#
"Well, as long as he's all right..."#br#
Selena closes her eyes and breathes deeply,#br#
and a grin spreads over her face.#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Selena##br#
"I really appreciate the fact that you helped the Catseye Pirate Crew,
and...%n%,#br#
I am NOT ANGRY at all!#br#
Why, I'd never get angry over something so trivial! How silly!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
An aura of tension hits you like a brick wall.
Selena's bright, pasted-on smile #br#
makes you incredibly nervous.#char$$501$0#|
21284|Raid the Nagas' stronghold, located to the west of the lake, to stop them from shipping out the Draconic Essence they've collected.|
21291|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Well, hey, there you are, my best pilot!#br#
These Dwarves from Meriland are unusually stubborn, which drives me mad.#br#
Even though Dwarves are generally relentless,#br#
these ones are over-the-top impossible!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"They argue with us constantly about how to operate the Robots.#br#
Just when we reached a consensus,#br#
we get stuck in another argument with those thick-headed fools. It's a waste of time!#br#
I mean, according to the third chapter of the Theory of Robots..."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Fearful this could turn into an incredibly boring lecture,#br#
you kindly remind Augustus that complaints never solve anything.#br#
He scratches the back of his head with an embarrassed sigh. #char$$870$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I guess you're right. I'm sorry.#br#
I forgot you don't know much about this.#br#
Wait a second, I have an idea!#br#
You're the perfect candidate to settle this argument!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Since we cannot persuade one another,#br#
we'll have a third party settle it! Genius! Why hasn't anyone in the history of mankind thought of that?!#br#
Would you please try to settle the argument between the two Dwarven Craftsmen arguing in the Refuge?#br#
Do whatever it takes to shut them up."#npc$$821$1#|
21292|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Well, though I know it's a waste of time to argue here,#br#
my Craftsman's soul won't let me back down quite yet.#br#
I have to show the people of Meriland what I'm really made of - that'll shut 'em up!"#npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
21293|#&7$Augustus##br#
"Well, um, the way you settle a dispute is very... straightforward, I guess you could say."#br#
Augustus peers at you with awe.#npcs85h+70$$823$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Never mind, as long as what you did ends the dispute between the Craftsmen,#br#
it was all worth it.#br#
Now that we've cleared the air, though, we ought to refocus on getting rid of the dastardly Demons occupying Meriland."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"%n%,#br#
Since you're already here,#br#
why not give us a hand? You weren't busy anyway, were you?"#npc$$824$1#|
21294|Get involved in settling the heated dispute between the Dwarven Craftsmen, and defeat the Robotic Vehicle they so adore.|
21301|#&7$Augustus##br#
"I hear from the Dwarf of Meriland#br# 
that just west of here is an entrance leading to an abandoned Frost Crystal mine.#br#
It was deserted because the tunnel leading to the mine collapsed,#br#
but the Frost Crystals inside have not yet been fully mined."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"And it just so happens that we brought a brand new drilling tool with us!#br#
With this tool, we can dig anything out,#br#
though it's not exactly, um, precise...#br#
but hey, a few cracked gems are a small price to pay for a lot of sparkly stuff!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"Please bring the tool with you to the entrance of the abandoned mine,#br#
and assist us in gathering Frost Crystals.#br#
We need 'em to make Siege Robotic Armor! Plus, they're just so darn pretty!#br# 
Afterward, please give them to Montero; he'll know what to do with them."#npc$$824$1#|
21302|#&7$Montero##br#
"Frost Crystals, eh? These glittery gems can work wonders.#br#
They resolve the dynamic and weight issues of the armor, and they look stunning to boot!#br#
I wish I'd been here earlier to get some,#br#
but there's no sense living in the past. For now, I'm counting on those sparkly pieces of wonder for my next competition!"#npcs85h+70$$825$1#|
21303|#&7$Montero##br#
"Hmm? Who dares disrupt me while I'm brainstorming the next dynamic Battle Robot? Um, hello, genius at work, here!#br#
Oh, it's you, %n%.#br#
What you just heard was classified, by the way. Don't tell Augustus under any circumstances!"#npcs85h+70$$823$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"You've come to gather Frost Crystals?#br#
Wonderful! Each piece of Frost Crystal is essential to launching attacks on Meriland.#br# 
As soon as we deploy our brand spankin' new Frost Crystal Robots onto the battlefield,#br#
those Demons will know the agony of defeat!"#npc$$824$1#|
21304|Use the 
drill head customized by Augustus to dig up the Frost Crystals buried deep 
beneath the ground, then hand them to Montero.|
21311|#&7$Impatient Dwarven Craftsman##br#
"Montero, something terrible's happened!#br#
Those blasted Deadly Web Spiders have reared their ugly, mulit-eyed heads,#br#
trapping our pilots in their silken webs and kidnapping them!"#M012031s85h+70$$821$0#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Well, that certainly isn't good.#br#
We don't have many pilots who can control the Robots left,#br#
and we definitely can't afford to lose them to testy arachnids!"#npcs85h+70$$823$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Those giant spiders wrap up their prey in sticky webbing and carry them away.#br#
The Battle Robots can't rescue the pilots without injuring them while destroying the web.#br# 
And we Dwarven Craftsmen are lovers, not fighters! And we're not even very good at loving!#br#
%n%, we need you to save them."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Montero##br#
"Please head for the tunnel in the south,#br#
and break the web up to rescue the pilots.#br#
Stay alert, though!#br#
Our enemies could be trapped inside the web, too!"#npc$$821$1#|
21312|#&7$Yakko##br#
"Oof, I... I...#br#
I need to drive those... those demons away,"#br#

"Oh, my.#br#
Did the Church send you?#br#
Please, the others need your help.#br#
They... they're trapped in the spider's web."#npcs85h+70$$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You explain to him that all of the other Dwarf pilots have been rescued.#br#
The injured Dwarf heaves a sigh of relief.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Yakko##br#
"Oh, thank goodness.#br#
I can finally relax for a moment!" The Dwarf closes his eyes peacefully.#npc$$201$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Realizing he is about to fall asleep,#br#
you shake him hard, trying to wake him.#char$$823$0#

#&7$Yakko##br#
"C'mon, just a few seconds of shuteye. #br#
I'm so exhausted. Can't you let me take a quick nap?"#npc$$828$1#|
21314|Break up the dead Linear Spider's web, rescue the Dwarf Pilots trapped within, and find the badly injured Yakko.|
21321|#&7$Yakko##br#
"Oh, by the way, #br#
here's the operational manual and instruction booklet for the Battle Robot.#br#
Please bring it to the Robot assembly point near the front."#npcs85h+70$$201$1#

#&7$Yakko##br#
"Boot up the Robot, and use it to take down the Deadwood Logs.#br#
I'll catch up with you after my nap. Promise."#npc$$201$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
As soon as Yakko hands you the equipment, he closes his eyes, instantly falls asleep,#br#
and begins snoring.#br#
You are at a loss as to what to do with him, and you wish you had earplugs.#char$$828$0#|
21322|#&7$Meriland Mk.II##br#
The enormous Battle Robot stands to one side silently,#br#
waiting to join the battle.#npc$$1$1#|
21323|#&7$Meriland Mk.II##br#
After you calibrate and configure the automaton according to the instructions,#br#
the Battle Robot reaches optimal status.#br#
It's now ready to be booted up on a moment's notice.#npc$$1$1#|
21324|You bring the control equipment Yakko gave you to the frontlines, where you activate the towering Battle Robot. The automaton, created by talented Dwarven Craftsmen, is powered by Frost Crystals.|
21331|#&7$Meriland Mk.II##br#
Not far away, a fierce battle rages on between the Battle Robot and a Deadwood Log.#br#
This brutal fight has caused tremendous damage and many casualties, so#br#
it's time to get in your Vehicle and bring the battle to an end at long last.#npc$$1$1#|
21332|#&7$Augustus##br#
"How are you faring in the battle?#br#
Although the Deadwood Logs have dealt some terrible blows to the Battle Robots,#br#
we still have our pilots, #br# 
and their safety is far more important."#npcs85h+70$$827$1#|
21333|#&7$Augustus##br#
"You look a bit worse for the wear,#br#
but at least you're safe.#br#
How did operating the new Battle Robot feel?#br#
Did you manage to take down all of the Deadwood Logs?"#npcs85h+70$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You inform Augustus of the situation at the Deadwood Logs' assembly ground#br# 
and explain that the beasts cannot be wiped out entirely.#br#
After listening to you, Augustus let loose a forlorn sigh.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Augustus##br#
"I suppose I can only hold out hope that the Alliance Army will get rid of the mastermind Demon as soon as possible.#br#
Until that happens, though, we can only keep fighting and do our best.#br# 
Now would be a good time to collect data from the robots; maybe we just need to analyze the situation from a different perspective.#br#
If you could give us a hand, we'd truly appreciate it!"#npc$$824$1#|
21334|You get behind the wheel, so to speak, and operate the Battle Robot to defeat Deadwood Logs, who guard the enemy's stronghold. After you finish the mission, you return to Meriland Refuge to report back to Augustus.|
21341|#&7$Victoria##br#
"%n%, you're just in time.#br#
Things are getting tense around here,#br#
and I need to tell you about the Alliance Army's latest tactics."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"The army we dispatched into Meriland was segmented due to an ambush.#br#
Our foes have positioned themselves around the entrance of the village.#br#
Our original strategy, which involved launching squads into the village,#br#
won't work well because we simply don't have the manpower. We lost too many soldiers in the ambush."#npc$$827$1# 

#&7$Victoria##br#
"We need your help, %n%.#br#
Once you kill the Demidrakes that guard the gate,#br#
we can send in reinforcements.#br#
It's the only way to turn this situation around."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Our enemies are very strong and powerful,#br#
so I suggest you recruit skilled partners.#br#
You can't win this battle alone!"#npc$$825$1#

"Those blasted things run so fast!#br#
If only we could get some reinforcements here..."#npc$$821$1#|
21343|#&7$Henry##br#
"Are... is that backup? #br#
Thank goodness! It's %n%! We're saved!"#br#
Henry grins excitedly.#npc$$821$1#|
21344|Break through the frontlines formed by the Demidrakes in front of Meriland, thus allowing Alliance reinforcements to enter.|
21351|#&7$Henry##br#
"We've been trapped here for some time,#br#
but I don't believe the majority of enemy forces are based here.#br#
This place only serves as a passageway for military information.#br#
Therefore, we've set our sights on intercepting and terminating the Icehoof Blitzers who deliver said intelligence."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Henry##br#
"They're very swift,#br#
so you'll need luck on your side if you hope to catch them. And really good running shoes."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Henry##br#
"On your way into the enemy's base,#br#

do your best to intercept them."#npc$$821$1#

If only we had a cannon... maybe they'd feel that!"#npc$$821$1#|
21353|#&7$Mark##br#
"%n%! You arrived just in time.#br#
The horrid Frost Cliffs are about to attack; they're going to hurl giant rocks at us.#br#
Please help us stop them from smashing us into goo!"#npc$$821$1#|
21354|Intercept Icehoof Blitzers, beasts who deliver military information to your foes, and continue further into the enemy's base.|
21361|#&7$Mark##br#
"If they keep throwing those boulders,#br#
they'll damage our cannons beyond repair.#br#
However, the Frost Cliffs are resilient, tricky foes; it takes a lot to injure them.#br#
We really need your support."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mark##br#
"Just target and kill the Frost Cliffs throwing rocks.#br#
Leave the rest to us.#br#
Those who have already entered the village are in need of help, too.#br#
Please continue on toward the village after you finish your task. We're counting on you!"#npc$$821$1#

Quite a title they've bestowed upon themselves, eh?#br#
Just you wait. Their arrogance will be their downfall."#npc$$2012$1#

21363|#&7$Alex##br#
"%n%, we meet again!#br#
Unfortunately, each time we meet, it seems nothing good ever comes of it.#br#
But hey, I'm glad to see you anyway!"#br#
Alex lets out  high-pitched giggle.#npc$$824$1#|
21364|Gigantic Frost Cliffs are destroying the mountain; the boulders they hurl at Alliance Soldiers have already caused too many casualties. Please terminate them as soon as possible.|
21371|#&7$Alex##br#
"So these demons think they own the place, huh?#br#
Well, they're dead wrong.#br#
We'll destroy the Dark Legion before they make any more progress with their evil scheme."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"I'll try to hold 'em off here.#br#
%n%, please protect the other Vanguard Soldiers.#br#
They don't stand a chance against the powerful Frosty Abominations mutated by the dragon's Draconic Essence."#npc$$825$1#

"Those blasted demons!#br#
I kill ten, and they come back in droves! They're like cockroaches!"#br#
Alex exclaims, pounding his fist into his open palm.#npc$$2012$1#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Can you hear me, Reinhart?#br#
If you can, you'd better stop this madness now, before more people get hurt! Or I'll squash you like the bug you are!"#npc$$1020$1#|
21373|#&7$Alex##br#
"Well done, %n%!#br#
Kill those Dark Legion fools;#br#
show them no mercy!" Alex shouts, angry tears in his eyes.#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look around and see the Vanguard Soldiers locked in battle.#br#
Some are already dead, while others are mortally wounded. Blood runs in rivers through the dirt.#br#
You instantly understand Alex's fury.#char$$829$0#|
21374|You respond to Alex's request, obliterating the Icy Frost Antipathy transformed from the Draconic Essence in the hopes of helping the Vanguard Soldiers.|
21381|#&7$Alex##br#
"Blast! More Demons have teleported here!#br#
%n%, I know you're working hard, but#br#
I need you to deliver information to Victoria,#br#
or we'll be at a distinct disadvantage here."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You nod curtly, eager to help.#br#
Just as you're about to leave,#br#
Alex stops you.#char$$2$0#

#&7$Alex##br#
"Before you go,#br#
could you get rid of the Bleak Skeletons? They're being teleported here at an alarming rate.#br#
My hands are full,#br#
but under no circumstances should the Soldiers know that I can't handle this alone."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
The Vanguard Soldiers who took part in battles in Meriland#br#
consider Alex not only their leader, but also their mentor.#br#
To keep up their morale,#br#
you must drive off the Dark Legion's villainous demons.#char$$822$0#

If we are constantly at a disadvantage in the battle, morale will plunge."#npc$$827$1#|
21383|#&7$%n%##br#
You rush to Victoria to inform her of the current situation in Meriland.#br#
You explain Alex's circumstances.#br#
Victoria sinks into deep thought,#br#
chewing her lip anxiously.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"I didn't think Alex would have such a tough time.#br#
I have to figure out a new military strategy#br#
to further disrupt our enemies' attack.#br#
Otherwise, they'll have us completely surrounded in no time flat."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Thanks for bringing me the news from the frontlines, %n%.#br#
The current situation has come to an impasse,#br#
but with your assistance, we should be able to shake things up.#br#
If possible, we'd love your help."#npc$$822$1#|
21384|Knock out Bleak Skeletons one by one, and bring the battle information back to Victoria, who is in charge of commanding and coordinating the troops.|

"Wow... %n%, stop right there...wait for me!"#br#
Gus catches up with you, gasping and out of breath.#M135010$Gus$829$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"I found you at last!#br#
The Grand Bishop wants me to bring you an extremely important message."#br#
Gus pauses to catch his breath, then continues.#M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"After countless hours of preparation,#br#
the Templars and the Alliance Army will launch an attack on the regions currently occupied by the Shadow Knights.#br#
These areas also serve as bases for the Dark Legion - Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg.#br#
The battle will be bloody and fierce, so be ready for the worst."#M135010$Gus$825$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"As for the rest, the Grand Bishop wants to relay it to you in person.#br#

21392|#&7$Belenus##br#
"What will come will come, but this is much sooner than I expected..."#br#
Belenus softly murmurs to himself.#npc$$828$1#|
21393|#&7$Belenus##br#
"%n%, here you are. I can hardly believe it."#br##br#
#&53$Belenus smiles gently, then looks around, signaling to those around you to leave the hall so the two of you can be alone.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Followers##br#
#&53$After the followers bow respectfully to the Grand Bishop, they file out of the hall quietly.##M109010$Followers$822$0#

"Before I explain everything, I want to give you a precious item. You are the only person in the world capable of controlling its power."#br# 
#&53$Belenus places Gram's Transformed Orb into your outstretched palm and curls your fingers around it.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"There. Now, let's get down to business."#br##br#
#&53$Belenus's smile fades, his eyes fixed straight ahead.##npc$$1$1#|
21394|Just as the feeling something bad might happen creeps into your psyche, Gus appears on order of Belenus, the Grand Bishop, to deliver a message.

Judging by the anxiety in Gus's eyes, you figure you'll have to return to Navea as soon as possible.|
21401|#&7$Belenus##br#
"I suppose you've heard from Gus. It's true; a war that will determine our future has already begun. The Alliance Army has infiltrated Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg, and our forces are desperately battling the Shadow Knights' Dark Legion."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"We must do whatever we can and devote all of our manpower and materials to this cause. We cannot afford to lose this war,"#br##br#
#&53$Belenus intones grimly.##npc$$826$1# 

#&7$Belenus##br#
"I have dispatched two Archbishops to Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg to assist our knights, and I hope you can head to those areas to learn more about the war's progress. Please deliver these instructions to Bismuth, the Bishop of Vulture's Vale."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#

21402|#&7$Bismuth##br#
"I will be stationed here to ensure things go smoothly. Don't worry about us; focus on the war at hand! You have my blessing,"#br#
#&53$Bismuth calmly explains to a soldier.##npc$$821$1#|
21403|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You give Bismuth the Grand Bishop's letter. He takes it eagerly, nodding as though he expected you.##char$$822$0#

#&7$Bismuth##br#
"The Grand Bishop worries so. I'm old enough to know who you are, %n%, Envoy of Gaia. I'm Bismuth. Pleased to meet you." 
#&53$Bismuth gives you a warm smile.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Bismuth##br#
"The warfare in Vulture's Vale has quickly escalated. One person is in charge of the soldiers in each war zone,"
#&53$Bismuth explains, pointing to some of the people you have already met.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bismuth##br#
"The Alliance Army of Triatio Highlands, the Makar Royal Legion of Stable Wind Grass, the Logistics Group of the Sanknie Alliance... they're all here, working together to fight this wretched war."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Bismuth##br#
"Child, go greet your old friends. I think they'll be most happy to see you. My blessing shall be with you always."#br#

Gus sighs, frowning.#br#
"There's been strange energy emanating from Alabastren Temple.#br#

21853|#&7$%n%##br#
You tell Gus that the strange energy he was talking about teleports people to Alabastren Temple in another dimension.#br#
The temple you were teleported into was nothing like the original one.#br#
The monsters inside may look exactly the same, but their power is much stronger.#char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
You are glad to report, however, that they are history now.#br#

You tell Gus that the strange energy was doing the same thing in Gydaie Glen that it had been doing in Alabastren Temple. Thankfully, however, it's now been taken care of.#char$$821$0#

"Really? Wonderful, wonderful. Thank you."#npc$$821$1#|

A powerful energy force is coming. #br#
It seems to be coming from the frontlines of the battlefield. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
Is it... more energy from the Dimensional Fissure? #br#
This energy is much more powerful than what we've previously experienced.#br#
 Could it be that even larger demons will be emerging from the Dimensional Fissure?#char$$1:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
The energy is extremely strong. #br#
You can sense that the location of the Dimensional Fissure is somewhere in the Mushroom Village in Mushroom Forest. #char$$1:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
The situation is urgent! We need to get there and find out what's going on.#char$$806:0$0#|
21882|#&7$Claire ##br#
"Well... I guess I'll just do my best..."#br#
Claire sighs.#npc$$828$1#|
21883|#&7$%n%##br#
The Dimensional Fissure is more unstable than you've ever seen it, #br#
and you're worried Claire won't be able to hold out much longer.#npc$$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Since the situation appears very serious,#br#
you give Claire a brief summary of your previous experience#br#
and tell her your idea about quickly fighting off the Dimensional Fissure demons.#char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Claire ##br#
"Are you a %n%?#br#
 Well, that's great!#br#
If I had to keep this up all by myself, I wouldn't last long."#npc$$2$1#|
21884|The power is immense. You can feel the unstable energy pouring from the Dimensional Fissure. To better understand the situation, you decide to head to Mushroom Village in the Mushroom Forest.|
21891|#&7$Claire ##br#
"I tried everything I could to stabilize the Dimensional Fissure, but to no avail. #br#
It looks like it's up to you..."#br#
Claire says weakly. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Claire ##br#
"According to your plan,#br#
our only hope for stabilizing the Dimensional Fissure#br#
is to enter the Dimensional Hall and release the shackles,#br#
allowing the Dimensional Demons to enter our world temporarily.#br#
Then we'll have to defeat them." #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Claire ##br#
"Hurry and find two partners to go with you into the Dimensional Hall#br#
and unlock the three shackles there.#br#
I think you'll be better prepared than I would for what happens next.#br#
You must, you simply MUST defeat the demons."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Claire ##br#
"Please hurry and defeat the demons. #br#
My magic can't hold out for much longer." #br#
Claire hands the Dimensional Crystal Key to you.#npc$$828$1#|
21892|#&7$Claire ##br#
"Please hurry and find two partners so that you may each carry a key into the Dimensional Hall. #br#
Whatever you do, don't let those demons invade our beautiful world." #npc$$311$1#|

You report the results of your battle with the demons to Claire. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Claire ##br#
"It's a good thing you were here to help -#br#
otherwise I fear I wouldn't have made it. #br#
I'm very grateful we have a powerful Envoy of Gaia to help defend the world!" #br#
Claire beams with happiness.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Claire ##br#
"Now I need to rebuild the Dimensional Shackles in the hall #br#
to prevent other demons from passing through," #br#
Claire continues.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Claire ##br#
"Please accept these small gifts. #br#
You've truly earned them." #br#
Claire puts the gifts in your hand.#npc$$824$1#|
21894|Claire hands you the Dimensional Crystal Key, but opening the shackles will require that three people enter the hall. After opening the three Shackles of Dimension, the Dimensional Demons will enter the hall. It's certainly a gamble... but no matter what, the demons must be defeated.|

#&7$Eibach##br#
"%n%, I assume you heard about the fierce creatures prowling outside of Brevis? #br#
They're blocking some of the roads that connect Brevis to the outside world. #br#
If we don't kick them out soon, the good people of Brevis will be barred from their own village."#npc$$824$1#

"Oh thank you, %n%! You're a true hero. #br#
Had we left those creatures to their own devices, #br#

Eibach reads the supply chain report with visible consternation.#npcs85h+70$$2$1#

#&7$Eibach##br#
"This report indicates that some of our rations have turned rancid. #br#

Eibach sighs before resuming his train of thought.#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Eibach##br#
"Staples such as Sweet Potatoes and Corn #br#
are an absolutely priority for testing. #br#
A lot of folks also enjoy the Crocodile Eggs, so you should give those a careful inspection, too."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Eibach##br#
"Food safety is the single most important factor for our people's health and well-being. #br#
If you properly collect the samples, we will reward you handsomely."#npc$$2$1#|

"I appreciate your help, #br#

#&7$Eidolon Research Institute Director##br#
"No. On second thought, the Envoys arriving here are all of unquestionable sanity and integrity. #br#

"Let's see...ah, this one! Our client here is called Isaias, and he's an explorer and treasure hunter. He was recently attacked by Pit Beetles in the Abandoned Mine while searching for treasure, and he dropped his treasure map!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#

#&7$Isaias##br#
"When these beetles attacked me, they managed to tear off half of my map! I need a bit of time to recover from my wounds, but if you can get the pieces back we should be able to find the treasure!"#br#

#&7$Isaias##br#
"But let's not get discouraged! After all, we have the treasure chest, now to see what's inside! It is quite heavy, isn't it. It must be packed full of treasure!"#br##br#
#&53$Isaias' voice lifts with excitement.##npc$$824$1#

#&53$Isaiah squawks, gaping in disbelief at the opened chest.##br##br#
"It's all scrap iron! This isn't worth anything!"#npc$$827$1#

"I think we've just been duped! Pirates must have collected some scrap metal and drew up this map as a joke. I can't believe I've been so foolish!"#br##br#

#&7$Isaias##br#
"No...I'm wrong... something valuable did come out of this treasure hunt: our friendship. The Explorer King never goes back empty-handed. This scrap metal is crap, but spending time together like this is priceless, right?"#br##br#

"If you get too close to me, my camouflage will be ruined!"#br##br#
#&53$Apparently, Clermont doesn't seem to think yelling will give him away...##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Clermont##br#
"This camouflage is so perfect that even Dustin, the mineral expert, would be deceived! He would be so thoroughly convinced that I was just another rock that he might actually come at me with a pickaxe..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Clermont##br#
"It could really happen! All he thinks about is stealing crystal ore! Hey! With this disguise, I bet I could catch him in the act. Wouldn't that be a sight to see? Heh!"#br##br#
#&53$Clermont laughs slyly.##npc$$821$1#|
70037|#&7$Dustin##br#
"Uh oh, gosh, I was just so nervous that I didn't know what I was doing!"#br##br#
#&53$Dustin scratches his head and looks pretty embarrassed.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Dustin##br#
"Ah! Please don't tell the boss! It's terrible to work in this mine, and I'll tell you all about it if you don't snitch! Do we have a deal? Great! OK, first thing you gotta know is... Oh! I think I hear the boss coming! We'll talk later!"#br##br#
#&53$Dustin scurries off with an arm-full of crystal ore...##npc$$823$1#|
70038|#&7$Bartley##br#
"Those Orelings were rough."#br##br#
#&53$Bartley wipes the sweat from his brow and takes a deep breath.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bartley##br#
"Many thanks for your help, stranger. There's no way I could have handled these creatures on my own."#br##br#
#&53$Bartley is truly grateful for your help.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bartley##br#
"I wish I could help you in the search for my colleagues, but fighting off those monsters has really taken it out of me... I should probably take a rest for a while so that I can be useful."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Bartley##br#
"If you can spare a moment for me to recover, I will gladly help you out in the search of my friends. If you can't wait, here's a tip: take care when around the pits. Those dark zones are the perfect hiding places for monsters."#npc$$824$1#|

"Receiving the Sprite's blessing before marriage is our only way to achieve full happiness."#br##br#
#&53$This strange phrase draws your attention as you browse the many requests crowding the bulletin board. Intrigued, you take a closer look...##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Oh, this request? It was put up by a woman about to get married!"#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle politely takes the request and continues.##M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"There is a tradition in the poster's village that when you get married, you must wear a Flower Crown blessed by the Sprites. It is like a prelude to a lifetime of happiness for that couple."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"However, earning the Graceful Sprite's blessing requires completing their trials in front of an altar. I bet that's not easy. Completing those trials proves that you are ready for a happy marriage."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This poster hurt her hands recently while cooking and she cannot reschedule her trials. So, now the couple is looking for someone to help them complete the trials."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"I really hope someone can help her before the date of her trials, otherwise I don't think she'll pass. She won't get that blessing. It would be a pity if she couldn't get married because of something like that."#M002060$Mirabelle$822$1#|
70042|#&7$Meira##br#
"Many people think marriage akin to prison. They think it traps you into misery, that you will always feel uneasy. I...don't want my marriage to end up like that..."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Meira##br#
"My village's tradition requires you to receive the Flower Crown that has been blessed by the Sprites before getting married. That is the only way to preserve the couple's happiness that so many claim is lost by being married. However, I can't pass the trials in my current condition. It's simply hopeless; my marriage is doomed before it even starts!"#npc$$822$1#|
70043|#&7$Meira##br#
"Oh! Thank you so much! I burnt both my hands accidentally while I was cooking a few days ago. It was painful, but thinking about not being able to complete the trials hurts even more."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Meira##br#
"The trials do allow a companion to help you, but that person can't be from the village. Each person in the village has their own trials, which means one has no choice but to look outside the village for help."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Meira##br#
"I feel so helpless! The world outside the village is so dangerous. As such, I've never been able to make friends outside of the village; I've always been too afraid! But I had to be brave for the sake of my love, so I took my elders' advice and sought out the Miola Group. I'm so relieved they found someone strong and very kind like you to help me!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Meira##br#
"Thank you so much for coming all this way to help! Now I can't wait for my wounds to heal so that I can enjoy my wedding day. I'm so excited to know that my future will be full of happiness!"#npc$$824$1#|
70044|Meira needs your guidance in completing the Sprite's tests. She would really like someone to help her every step of the way.|

"There has been a violent attack! If you can, you should head out right away to lend a hand."#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle looks very concerned.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This emergency message is from the Old Tomb. The Task Force was searching there for a great relic: the Ancient Lord's Sword, but the tomb is full of danger and many of the explorers have been injured."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"According to legend, this elaborately designed tomb is armed to the teeth with traps. The team working there is in extreme danger. You're well known for being quite brave, will you save them?"#npc$$821$1#|
70052|#&7$Stanley##br#
"Wow! I never thought there would be so many dangerous devices in an old tomb such as this! The architect must have been truly remarkable."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
"I'm very thankful for your help, %n%. All who were injured were able to be treated right away so everyone is already making their recovery. We are very grateful!"#npc$$824$1#|
70053|#&7$Stanley##br#
"I can't believe it! After all that work to get past those traps...The Ancient Lord's Sword is a fake!"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Stanley##br#
"Somebody must've beaten us to it! Dash it all! Well...looks like today was a failure, everyone. But, at least we learned a lot today, right? Thanks for the great display of courage, %n%. Until we meet again!"#npc$$824$1#|
70054|Help the Task Force Team dismantle the many dangerous trapping devices that litter the grounds of the Old Tomb so that they can make their way deeper in and locate the Ancient Lord's Sword.|

#&53$A request catches your eye, the first sentence seizing your attention...##br##br#
"I want to propose to the woman who holds my heart."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Aww...Did your heart go soft to those words, too?"#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle peers over your shoulder to look at the same request.##M002060$Mirabelle$825$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"A young gentleman put up this request. He wants to propose to someone, but he can't muster up the courage. So, he has not said a word about it."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Supposedly, there is a cave full of Flower Monsters. Some of the world's most beautiful flowers grow on their bodies. Those flowers are called Proposal Flowers, as they are rumored to make a marriage proposal a successful one. The most difficult of these to find are called the Pristine Proposal Flowers."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"With those flowers being so beautiful, of course the monsters they grow on are dangerous. Those with Pristine Proposal Flowers on them must be frightening! The poor man doesn't know how to fight, so he is looking for a strong, compassionate soul to help him..."#M002060$Mirabelle$828$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Meanwhile, I didn't even know Proposal Flowers existed! How about you go help him out? I'm dying to see how pretty these flowers are and if they really work."#M002060$Mirabelle$825$1#|
70062|#&7$Kirk##br#
"At last, we've found the proposal flower monsters! These monsters look...a bit more threatening than I thought. Such is the price of love!"#npc$$829$1#|
70063|#&7$Kirk##br#
"Thank you so much, %n%! There's no way I could've taken care of the proposal flower monsters like that! Now, with this flower, I should be able to successfully propose to my love!"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Kirk##br#
"I won't let this Pristine Proposal Flower go to waste! I'm so inspired by your courage - I'll definitely be married soon. Just you wait!"#npc$$824$1#|

There is one request that is written in beautiful script.#br#
You open the request and read it over.#br#
It seems to have been written by a girl named Valerie.#npc$Urgent Quest Bulletin Board$1$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"My mother has a very rare disease. The doctor said that only Infinity Grass from the Oblivion Expanse could save her.#br#
My brother Jaffa left for the Oblivion Expanse to look for Infinity Grass."#M002020$Valerie$821$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"But now it's been almost two days since Jaffa left. #br#
I was worried about him, so I also went to the Oblivion Expanse." #M002020$Valerie$821$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"But once I got there, I realized it was full of evil creatures.#br#
I don't have the power to fight them, so I'd like to find a brave person to#br#
go there and help me find Infinity Grasses to save my mother and brother." #M002020$Valerie$829$1#

#&7$Mirabelle Clerk##br#
"This poor girl!#br#
Her mother is ill, and now her brother has gone missing too.#br#
You really must help her!"#M002060$Mirabelle Clerk$829$1#|
70072|#&7$Valerie##br#
"I'm tired of feeling helpless, so I've decided that I want to learn martial arts! I can't always rely on others' help. Someday, I want to help others too!"#npc$$821$1#|
70073|#&7$Valerie##br#
"Thank you! Thank you! Not only did you find Infinity Grass, but you rescued my brother too! I don't know what to say...I'm so happy!"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"I've studied how to use the Infinity Grass. First you need to clean it in mountain spring water, then you have to grind it for three hours. Then, you stir it over a slow fire for twelve hours straight. Finally, you use frozen water to solidify it and you're finished!"#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"It sounds really complicated, but compared to what you've done for me, this should be nothing!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"I need to remember to keep training and testing myself so that I don't have to seek help like this all the time."#npc$$822$1#|

#&53$Feelings of sympathy and concern settle into you as a request catches your attention. It was written by an elderly person wanting to find someone to help bring his children back home...##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This is a request made by an elderly gentleman. His children are so rambunctious - they just ran off! The man didn't have the strength to chase after them."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"The place these kids ran off to is a site of dangerous ruins where even normal adventurers don't dare go!"#M002060$Mirabelle$823$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"If you have time, please go help the old man. You should go to the ruins and bring back the children. Just be careful; that place is rumored to hold many dangers."#M002060$Mirabelle$829$1#|
70082|#&7$Tyrone##br#
"I'm so worried; those children decided to run off into those ruins, but I just couldn't keep up with them. With these old bones, I don't think I could ever make it there at this rate..."#npc$$829$1#|
70083|#&7$Tyrone##br#
"So I was right to worry. My kids have not yet learned the ways of the world, so it's easy for them to get into things that they shouldn't..."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"Anyway, thank you very much for your help! I'm pretty sure this experience has wisened them up a bit. Perhaps they won't be so ornery next time."#npc$$824$1#|
70084|Enter the ruins, find Tyrone's children, and bring them back to him safely.|
70091|#&7$Graceful Sprite##br#
"At last, it is complete! Here, take this Blessed Flower Crown."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Graceful Sprite##br#
"I'm so glad I still have my great magical powers! I don't understand this thing called marriage, but it doesn't matter to me! If I can bless the humans with joy and happiness, that is enough for me! Be well, human!"#npc$$3001$1#|
70092|#&7$Graceful Sprite##br#
"I can only impart the blessing of the sprites if it is my most true feeling...I can't do it for just any old thing if it's not worth it!#npc$$2$1#|

"I must thank you again for recovering my most important magical item. Without it, I am completely powerless..."#npc$$51$1#

#&7$Graceful Sprite##br#
"In the end, everybody is happy and has just what they need! This is great! You better deliver that crown to the bride soon, I'm sure she's waiting."#npc$$2$1#|

#&53$While perusing the notices on the board, you come across one that is quite lengthy. It appears to have been written by an honorable thief named Mina.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mina's Letter##br#
"It's been several days since I've last sailed the rough seas. While I don't currently have proof, I highly suspect someone has been watching me. As such, I dare not venture to my base for fear of leading my pursuer there."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mina's Letter##br#
"I cannot continue to skulk around this way forever, of course. I will return to my base tonight in hopes to lure out whoever it is. Once I get to my base, I should be safe, unless..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mina's Letter##br#
"Anyway, in the off chance you do not hear from me by tonight, it will mean that I am still being stalked. In that case, I would appreciate some assistance in taking down these lowlifes."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mina's Letter##br#
"I have enclosed within this message an envelope with a map and further instructions intended only for the eyes of whoever intends to take on this mission. Whoever undertakes this task should only open it when they come upon my base entrance."#br##br#
#&53$The letter is signed "Mina."##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This seems like quite a pickle this lady thief has gotten into, no? If you want to find out more, you'll have to accept all the responsibilities of this quest first. Hopefully she's still safe!"#M002060$Mirabelle$823$1#|
70102|#&7$Mina##br#
"Curses! Could these simple minded buffoons really have broken through my defenses?! This is unprecedented! What... What should I do?!"#br##br#
#&53$Mina looks increasingly distressed.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mina##br#
"Hey! Who goes there?! Who is it?! State your purpose! I have no treasure for you!"#br##br#
#&53$Mina sees you and begins to panic.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Quickly and calmly, you explain to her that you have answered her request and she relaxes slightly.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Mina##br#
"You had me worried for a second...Ah! No! Did you see Oscar out there?! He'll steal all my treasure if you don't get rid of him right now!"#npc$$823$1#|
70103|#&7$Mina##br#
"Thanks for getting Oscar off my back. That vile vermin... He kept robbing villagers of their treasures. Even my house was robbed by him."#br##br#
#&53$Mina huffs angrily.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mina##br#
"I had to sneak into his base to get back what's mine. Didn't expect him and his stupid brothers to hunt me down."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mina##br#
"The only thing I could do at the time was hide and set up some traps to buy time. I kept hoping someone like you would accept my request and show 'em who's boss."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Mina##br#
"If you screw up the combination once, you won't be able to try the lock again. It will activate a trap that will fry you like chicken. That aggravating pirate... He fooled a lot of his henchmen into trying to open that lock."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mina##br#
"So, thank you again for kicking butt and taking names. You saved my life! Remember to be careful with my traps as you leave. After all of that, it would be a shame to see you go out in such a way."#npc$$822$1#|
70104|Mina, an honorable thief who only steals from pirates, has been followed and watched by someone lately. She's hiding out in her secret base after leaving a request with Mirabelle.

#&53$As your gaze sweeps across the overstuffed request board, you spot one carved on a chunk of iron. Intrigued, you pull the iron piece from the board to examine it...##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Oh, so you noticed that, too! It was written by a spirited young boy."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"His name is Billy. He was a contestant in the robot fighting tournament, but the robot he and his father was working on was obliterated in a previous match. Since then, he has not had the heart to compete..."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"They are quite poor, and his father's sick, which has also really hindered them in the competition. I bet they could really use that prize money. One of them heard about a cave stocked with Abandoned Robots. Billy hopes to venture there in search for a new Robot companion."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"However, those robots are abandoned for a reason - they're all defective. As such, they are all quite dangerous. Billy is just a child and his father is too sick to fight them off. They could really use a hand from someone who is able to fight those bots!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"And that brings us to this request. Billy etched this on metal because he didn't have any paper to use. I really hope you can set aside time in your busy schedule to help him!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#|
70112|#&7$Billy##br#
"I would love to continue making battle bots with my dad, but we barely have the money to eat much less make a new bot. So I'm here to see if any of these robots are still useful."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Billy##br#
"These things are definitely too strong, though. They'll kick my butt! So I wrote a little something, hoping someone can come by and help."#npc$$827$1#|
70113|#&7$Billy##br#
"Gee, thanks! No, really! Thanks a ton...None of this would have happened if not for you!"#npc$$829$1#

"This new bot will definitely cheer my dad up, and we can compete again. I'll train really really hard and win the championship so that I can pay you back!"#npc$$824$1#|

"Ah, this request is from Reid, a boy from a mining village. There seems to be a little war going on over there!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Don't look so concerned! This 'war' is just between two kids, Reid and Shiloh, and their pet tanuki. So... it's a tanuki war!"#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle giggles.##M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Tanuki have become popular pets because they're so cute! But they're quite prolific and tend to breed out of control if left unsupervised. It seems that their tanuki population is causing some fierce competition over territory."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"To give her pet tanukis the best habitat, Shiloh has declared a tanuki war against Reid and his pets. The villagers tried to organize peace talks between them, but it didn't take. So, here we are! No problem too small for us, right?"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

"What a relief! Thank you so much for helping!"#br##br#

"Yes, I think we've got it! Excuse me while I take this to our best craftsman. Thank you again. Oh! Don't forget your reward!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$First Village Chief##br#
"I can't help but feel a little ashamed... Perhaps we need to re-evaluate our customs. We end up debating every little thing now, but no one is willing to take responsibility for their actions. All we do is pass the buck to others..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$First Village Chief##br#
"If you hadn't come, we would have perished in the first wave of bugs. Once we've dealt with our bug problem, we will have to change our ways."#npc$$825$1#|

"This request is sent to us from the chief of Floras! A few days ago, when celebrating the Sprite Blessing Ceremony, some little ones ran in and made a mess of the whole thing. Not only did it ruin the ceremony, but it seems to have called forth angry sprites!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Now the Sprite Altar in the village is swarming with these Fallen Sprites. They are attacking anyone who gets near the altar, and have trapped the villagers who were nearby when it all started. Are you willing to help them out? They could really use an Envoy out there!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#|
70152|#&7$Floras Chief##br#
"Kingdom above, this is a travesty! How could our sacred altar be destroyed like this?! About halfway through our ceremony, the grasslings rushed in like a stampede. One of them emitted a strange lightning which scared everyone who could guard the altar away. After they cleared the area, then we saw the destruction..."#npc$$821$1#|
70153|#&7$Floras Chief##br#
"Thank you, %n%, your kindness is unending. There's no use in me blaming the grasslings...they can't go against their nature. We can only blame ourselves for failing in our ritual, but at least we have learned a lot to better prepare for next time. Here, take this reward.

"In Penguin Village lives an old mage named Exedore. He has a special affinity for penguins and tames the most wild and savage specimens to become good friends to the villagers. But now it seems that all the penguins have gone mad at once!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"One of Exedore's prized possessions, the Demon King's Eye, is a necklace of great and mysterious power. His beloved penguin pet, Gump, managed to steal it and now its power is unleashing the savage primal powers of the penguin populace! The penguins are on a rampage!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"As we speak, Exedore is trying to prevent Gump and the other penguins from full rebellion. But he is getting old and could really use some help dealing with all of them. Otherwise, the penguins will completely overrun the village! It'll be a penguin-ocalypse!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#|

#&7$Milton##br#
"I fully intended to have some of our own young villagers undertake the trials, but our youth are not interested in our traditions and have ventured out into other places of the world."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Milton##br#
"Ungrateful kids... Luckily for us, the main objective of these rituals is the pleasing of the gods. And the gods never specifically said the one to do the trials had to be from this village. Why, ages ago, the foreign husband of one of our women successfully underwent the trials with no problems."#npc$$821$1#

"If we fail to complete our ritual, our gods may forsake us. This year we've already experienced extreme drought one moment and heavy storms at the next! Our grain crops are in terrible danger of dying off."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This request is from one of our top clients, a very wealthy merchant named Sheldon. He's apparently got a mountain of money hoarded away in some cave, and is trying to protect the stuff from Golden Flowertraps."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$ Mirabelle##br#
"According to Sheldon, these Golden Flowertraps are a plague upon the wealthy as they gorge themselves upon gold and other treasures!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

"Let me quickly summarize the request for you, alright? A merchant named Wilhelm, was in Helonia and was attacked... by pirates! He's been robbed!" #M002060$Mirabelle$823$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Wilhelm thought he could solve the issue on his own by pretending to agree to the pirate's demands, but now he and other members of the Chamber of Commerce are trapped at the pirate camp!"#M002060$Mirabelle$824$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Why did they ask you ? That's obvious! After all you've done for Helonia, including defeating the pirates once before, you're the obvious choice for the job."#M002060$Mirabelle$825$1#|
70212|#&7$Wilhelm##br#
"The pirates of Helonia are out of control! Can you believe that they've even robbed the Merchant Guild's itself? We need justice! If things keep going down this path, Helonia will be ruined!"#npc$$821$1#|
70213|#&7$Wilhelm##br#
"You did it! You really are amazing, %n%! I can hardly believe you also defeated the Abyss Axe Leader - the very best among the pirates. If it were not for you, we'd still be scratching our heads about this whole situation. Here, please take this reward. You earned it!"#npc$$821$1#|

"This request come from an ancient village. The chief, Miriya, and her villagers have been suffering from an unfathomable mollusk invasion! They - the mollusks, not the villagers - are actually killing people!"#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"All of the fighters in the village are either injured or too frightened to deal with the mollusks. Their last hope is outsider intervention."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

"She would like someone who is strong, determined, and not afraid of anything to join her in infiltrating the Mollusk Lair and wiping them out. She doesn't want to have to worry about these things ever again."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"We've had some trouble finding someone to take this case - it seems a lot of people are quite afraid of these things! I can see the determination in your eyes, though! I know you'll never quit, even if you were faced with millions of mollusks. Help them, Envoy of Gaia! You are their only hope!"#M002060$Mirabelle$822$1#|
70282|#&7$Miriya##br#
"These mollusks are everywhere! They reproduce so quickly! We need to squash their nests and put an end to this before it gets out of control. Even if we can't get them all, perhaps the destruction of their nests will drive them out."#br##br#

"We did our best to fight back, but were horribly outnumbered, so we had no choice but to flee and watch from afar as they destroyed our village..."#npc$$828$1#

"Well, %n%, I better go back and help rebuild the village, but don't think I forgot your reward! Here you go! Now, you should be on your way. We'll take care of everything here. The smoke from the burning bug nests can't be good for your health!"#npc$$821$1#|

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This "E" stands for Eddie; specifically, the famous Demon Hunter and Exorcist, Eddie. Whenever he accepts a quest, he uses some magic to write his fancy "E" on the cover."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

"Basically, a devious organization has taken all the men from the requestor's village, but no one knows why."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"One of the men was able to escape; he managed to tell the townsfolk where the others were taken before he lost consciousness. His entire body was battered; it seems the others must be in danger."#M002060$Mirabelle$823$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"It would be really great if you could go there right away. The requestor went off to find more help in order to better the odds of rescuing the men. I suspect fighting this organization will be a challenge."#M002060$Mirabelle$828$1#|

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Oh, yes! It was posted by a Dwarf. He didn't say anything about it, he just slapped it up there and left."#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle squints at the request.##M002060$Mirabelle$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After analyzing the piece of metal for a bit, you notice a barcode stamped to the back. Suddenly, it begins to emit a faint glow.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Oh, you managed to figure out how to read it!"#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle peers over your shoulder. By this time, the glow from the hunk of metal fades.##M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"No one seems to know where that piece of metal came from. It really just appeared on the board out of thin air. After taking a look at it, we could only discern that it came from an old, abandoned factory. It's quite strange."#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle shrugs.##M002060$Mirabelle$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask Mirabelle if the metal has ever glowed before. She looks at you, surprised.##char$$806$0#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Glowing, you say? That's never happened, as far as I know. We had Dwarf engineers run scores of tests, and they even tossed it into a hot furnace. That piece of metal stayed cool. It doesn't react to anything in any way, in fact."#M002060$Mirabelle$823$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Hmm, perhaps...."#br#
#&53$Mirabelle frowns, deep in thought, then lifts her head to look at you.##br#
"Strange things do seem to happen when you're around. This time is probably no different. Here is the location of the abandoned factory. When you have time, please go there and take a look around."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

"Thanks to you, we've made significant progress. This whole thing started with Rockman, but he is an old model. Even with upgrades, he would have still exercised inferior power output."#M112012$$821$1#

"According to Sylvia, only members identified as part of the Cult can get into their secret base."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Also, I've heard that the cult's leader, Dabo, has divine powers to grant you good luck, cure ailments or make your dreams come true."#M002060$Mirabelle$824$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Acquiring cult identification is expensive, and many people have called Dabo out on his false powers. He seems to be just a con artist, so Sylvia worries that Jenecka will fall for his ploy."#M002060$Mirabelle$826$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"We don't know if this witch is evil, but if she is, this could be a very thorny situation. After all, villagers keep disappearing. The longer this lasts, the more in danger the villagers are."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"The requestor seems to have found the location of the missing villagers, in a place called the Witch's Forest. As he is so worried about the villagers' safety, he has already headed there."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

At that moment, all notion that I was a priest was forgotten. All I could think about was using black magic to obtain that power."#M108021$Llewelyn$827$1#

#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"It never crossed my mind that it could be a trap. My wrath and greed made it easy for the demon to steal both my body and mind. To maintain this power, I needed living sacrifices for a dark ritual. At first, the sacrifices were only small deer, but eventually those sacrifices became lost travelers, and then Lycra villagers...."#M108021$Llewelyn$823$1#

#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"By the time I realized the evil I was committing, it was too late; the monster had its hold on me. I knew my only way to end this was to find a strong warrior like you to destroy the mortal shell that this demon possessed. I tricked the monster by saying that sacrificing an Envoy of Gaia would infinitely strengthen our power, so the demon was adamant about drawing you here."#M108021$Llewelyn$1$1#

#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"When the demon learned that I did not place any curses on you, it returned my consciousness. Still, I'm glad you succeeded, even if it meant my death. This is the price I had to pay for what I have done. Thank you for saving the villagers. I'm sorry, I...."#br##br#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Not far from the village is a place called Chateau Valentine. Bandits have taken this castle over, turning it into their own hideout. Since then, they've raided nearby villages, demanding the residents to give them all of their valuables."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Sonia lives near the chateau, and her village has been harassed by the bandits. Her husband was in charge of delivering the village's treasure to the bandits."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Three days have passed since Redd left with the treasure, so Sonia now worries about her husband's return. She's gathered every last scrap of value in their home to take to the chateau. She hopes to use those belongings to get into the castle in order to look for Redd."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Sonia knows of the danger, but all she cares about is finding her husband. She wrote this request in hopes that we can send someone to go into the castle with her."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Redd##br#
#&53$Redd glances at his wife, holding back tears.##br##br#
"Sonia, you foolish woman. Why did you go and do something so dangerous? If something would have happened to you, I would never forgive myself."#M005020$Redd$828$0#

#&7$Sonia##br#
"Stop talking nonsense. As you can see, I'm fine. If I stayed in that village like a coward, I would have never forgiven myself."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sonia##br#
#&53$Tenderly, Sonia lifts a hand to wipe away Redd's tears.##br##br#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Hahaha, just kidding! Oh, don't look at me like that! In all seriousness, this request is quite mysterious. Not long ago, monstrous faces have been popping up on ripe pumpkins and then flying away. Naturally, the pumpkin farmers are a bit disturbed."#M002060$Mirabelle$825$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Those farmers chased the pumpkins to a gloomy hut in the woods, but the ominous laughing was enough to keep them from going inside to take a look. So, what do you say? Are you brave enough to see what's going on inside that hut?"#M002060$Mirabelle$828$1#|
70442|#&7$Simpson##br#
"Ah, wait for me, adventurer! Admittedly, I'm a bit scared, but I have to find Nelly! Er... I mean... we have to get the missing pumpkins back."#br##br#

"I suppose it doesn't matter. Until the evil is dispelled, my brothers and I can't give up the chase. No evil deed can escape the hand of righteousness!"#br##br#
#&53$You feel a strange shift in the air as Simpson speaks, but the tension quickly dissipates as his rage does.##M102040$$826$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"You've done very well, huma--adventurer. Nelly is clever enough. Meanwhile, we've been wracking our brains over this. This incident with the flying pumpkins is a trifling comparison."#br##br#
#&53$You can't help but feel a little suspicious.##M102040$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"Why are you looking at me like that? These are just the complaints of a humble pumpkin farmer, that's all."#br##br#

A simple and plain note catches your eye.

I asked the church for help and they really came through! 
Unfortunately, there's not much power left in it. 
Come on, we have to be quick."#br##br#

It really makes the night great, eh? Flying through the air, helping out... it all warms my heart so much!"#br##br#

#&53$You struggle through the snow to reach the Winter Village, but it's taking longer than you planned. You curse your bad luck as you look for the one who submitted the request. Eventually you spot a man in a red, padded jacket waving at you.##M316012$ Nicolas$822$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Oh, great! Finally! Someone who can help!"#br##br#
#&53$The old man in the strange outfit looks kind of familiar. ##M316012$ Nicolas$824$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"I've been trying to spread some supplies through the Winter Village. That's why I asked for an adventurer's help, but nobody seemed to be showing up, so I started working on it myself." #M316012$$829$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"I accidentally let the sleigh slide down the hill though, so now I'm trying to recollect all of the gifts. Since you're here, you think you could help? I could also use a hand collecting materials to repair the sleigh."#br##br#
#&53$You nod and say that you will help.##M316012$ Nicolas$821$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Please collect five Wooden Planks, five Ropes and five Inedible Red Fruits. You can find these things in the Small Winter Village, and we can use them to repair the sleigh. After that, we can leave for the Small Winter Village, and give them a nice surprise!" #M316012$ Nicolas$824$1#|

#&53$Among the requests, you notice one decorated with drawings of fireworks. The gorgeous and complex design is difficult to look away from.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Are you curious about that request? It comes from the Chief of the Fireworks Village. It's a village that only makes fireworks. Which is pretty obvious, now that I think about it."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This village has an enemy called Daq, the Dark Sprite. He hates light and hopes to plunge the world into darkness."#br##br#
"One night he cursed the Fireworks Village, turning everyone into a monster or an animal."#M002060$Mirabelle$1$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Naturally, this completely shut the village down. Now it's impossible for them to finish their fireworks orders on time. Yes, that really is their biggest concern."#M002060$Mirabelle$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"The only way to break this curse is to defeat Daq. If you want more details, accept this quest, head to the Fireworks Village, and speak with the Elder."#M002060$Mirabelle$1$1#|
70472|#&7$White Beard##br#
"Brave Adventurer! I'm so glad you've come. This village pinned its hopes on that request, and it looks like it might have paid off. We think you have a good chance of defeating the Dark Sprite!"#br##br#
#&53$White Beard stares at you, seriously.##npc$$821$1##br#

#&7$White Beard##br#
"If you want to defeat Daq, you must ignite the Spirit Torches in the village. Then you can find the Dark Sprite's Spawn hiding in the village and defeat them."#npc$$821$1#|
70473|#&7$White Beard##br#
"Thank you so much! You defeated Dark Sprite Daq, and helped us recover our fireworks. Thanks to you, everything has turned out for the best!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Floret##br#
"Exactly! If it weren't for you, I don't know if things would have ever gone back to normal."#M067010$Floret$1$1#

#&7$White Beard##br#
"Please accept this reward, along with our village's gratitude! We will never forget your help."#br##br#
#&53$White Beard hands you a heavy bag.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$White Beard##br#
"I have a feeling that the Dark Sprite won't give up so easily, though. He may attack again and, if that happens, we would require your aid once more."#br##br#
#&53$White Beard sighs.##npc$$822$1#|
70474|The villagers from the Fireworks Village were attacked by Dark Sprite Daq, and have been turned into monsters and animals by his curse. Someone must defeat this Daq in order to break the curse.

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You ask him to quickly tell you what's going on.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Scientist Dean##br#
"Several years ago, I built a teleportation device. I poured my heart and soul into this machine and used to to travel the world."#M012010$Scientist Dean$825$1#

#&7$Scientist Dean##br#
"Then, one day, the device got damaged during a thunderstorm. A lightning bolt attacked my precious baby! After that, I haven't been able to control it."#M012010$Scientist Dean$828$1#

#&7$Scientist Dean##br#
"Yesterday, I tried to use the device to teleport to Skandia. When I got there, not a soul was around! Instead, the place was crawling with horrible monsters! I barely managed to escape."#M012010$Scientist Dean$826$1#

#&7$Scientist Dean##br#
"I tried to shut off the machine when I arrived back here, but I couldn't. All I can do is use other instruments to interfere with its energy waves long enough for someone else to hopefully pop by and help."#M012010$Scientist Dean$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$This is definitely a serious matter; you can't let those demons enter this world! You inform Dean the Scientist that you're willing to try to resolve the problem.##char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Scientist Dean##br#
"The place is swarming with Bunnyhops and the Bunnyhop Lord. They are all very aggressive, so you should probably take some folks with you."#br##br#

"Take others with you. Defeating that Bunnyhop Lord will not be a cakewalk!"#M012010$Scientist Dean$2$1#|
70512|#&7$Scientist Dean##br#
"Compared to dealing with those terrifying Bunnyhops, paying you is a trivial matter."#M012010s85h+70$Scientist Dean$2$1#

#&7$Scientist Dean##br#
"However, for everyone's safety, I think there should be more than one person helping me. If just one person died in the Otherworld, there'd be no one to bring back the body."#M012010$Scientist Dean$828$1#|

"Oh, hello! I'm the head of the Eidolon Research Institute. You must be an Envoy of Gaia, yes? My team has been researching Eidolons for decades. Do you see the light coming out of that well? There's a lab down there, constructed by our team."#M119010$Henrik$2$1#

"Eidolons that you can summon from the Guild Manor is only one product of our meticulous work. All we need to do is adjust the level of Eidolon energy to summon Eidolons with different levels of power!"#M119010$Henrik$821$1#

#&7$Henrik##br#
"However, we need to make adjustments so that an Eidolon can only be summoned in special locations. So, we chose a place with stable energy to build our lab. We call it the 'Temple of the Eidolons'! The only way to enter is down the well behind me."#M119010$Henrik$821$1#

#&7$Henrik##br#
"My team has placed three summoning stones of different energy densities into boxes. Please open the box suitable for your abilities. You can only open one box at a time, so please don't be greedy. Also, only one person can go into the temple at a time. Make sure you're prepared before you go in."#M119010$Henrik$821$1#

"Ugh, I'm so upset..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$Concerned, you ask Erwin what the problem is.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Erwin##br#
"Well, it's like this, %n%. I want to promote my village's beautiful firework creations, you know? If we could only set off some of our most expertly crafted ones in bustling Helonia, I think it'd really spark people's interest in our products! Ha ha... get it? 'Spark' their interest?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erwin##br#
"However, er, when it comes to business, I'm really shy... Just thinking about promoting our fireworks in front of a HUGE crowd of strangers... I get so nervous I can hardly stand it!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Erwin##br#
"Do you think you could lend me a hand? All you have to do is follow these instructions and you'll be able to make some fireworks. Then you'll just have to set them off at certain prime locations for maximum effect. It'd be great if you could do this for me, %n%. I'll have a reward ready for you!"#npc$$821$1#|
80062|#&7$Erwin##br#
"What's up? Did you run into trouble out there?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erwin##br#
"Ah, having trouble finding the ingredients? Well, I can help you there! You can find Red Phosphor to the south of Candetonn. After you get some, just grind it up into a fine powder and combine it with the Firework Materials. Bam! You'll have made some beautiful fireworks!"#npc$$821$1#|
80063|#&7$Erwin##br#
"These fireworks... They're perfect! Are you sure you haven't made some before? I could see their beauty even from where I was standing!"#br##br#
#&53$Erwin's eyes sparkle with excitement. You must've really impressed him!##npc$$824$1#

"This will definitely spark a lot of interest in the people! Thank you, thank you! If you could lend me your help in the future, that would be brilliant! Bam! Here's your reward! Please, accept this with my most heartfelt thanks!"#npc$$1$1#|
80064|Erwin wants to set off fireworks in the square to promote the hand-made fireworks of his village, but he's so shy that he can't work up the courage to do it himself.

Head south of Candetonn and look for Red Phosphor. Right-click it to grind into a fine powder and then follow the instructions on the Fireworks Fusion Formula to create some dazzling fireworks. Once you're finished, set them off in the specified spots in order to help out Erwin with his demonstration.|

#&53$Along your journey you overhear other travellers speaking of the recent news of Port Skandia. It seems that some mysterious maiden has appeared there...##char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$When she first appeared it was raining heavily, and no one knows where she came from or what she came for. Whenever someone tries to approach her, she quickly disappears.##char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$After hearing all this strange news, you are overtaken by your curiosity and decide to return to Port Skandia to look for the mysterious maiden...##char$$2$0#|
80072|#&7$Mysterious Maiden##br#
"What is this place...? Where am I...?"#br##br#
#&53$You slowly approach the maiden in the green cape as she mumbles to herself.##br##br#
"Ah! Who are you!?"#br##br#
#&53$The maiden jumps, startled, as she notices your approach. You slowly raise your hands and tell her that you mean no harm.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Mysterious Maiden##br#
"Are you from around here?"#br##br#
#&53$Having never seen you before, she seems curious as to your presence. You nod your head and ask her why she's been sneaking around.##npc$$823$1#

#&7$Sasha##br#
"My name is Sasha. I'm told it is kind of...a cute name..."#br##br#
#&53$Still seeming cautious, the strange Sasha speaks openly and doesn't appear as fearful as you've heard. You smile, agreeing that her name is nice, and politely introduce yourself.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Sasha##br#
"I...don't actually know why I'm here. I would like to go back to where I'm from."#br##br#
#&53$While her words are calm, Sasha's expression is the picture of worry.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sasha##br#
"As you are a local, perhaps you can manage to help me?#br##br#
#&53$Before you manage to get a word in, the maiden Sasha quickly asks for your help.##npc$$821$1#|
80073|#&7$Sasha##br#
#&53$You nod and say that you will do what you can to help her out.##br##br#
"Oh, how wonderful! I've been very worried about what to do! I'm so happy that we've met."#br##br#
#&53$She truly does seem quite happy. Seeing her smile makes you glad that you are here to lend your assistance.##npc$$824$1#|
80074|Having overheard rumors of a mysterious maiden lurking around Port Skandia, you decide to investigate.|
80081|#&7$Sasha##br#
"I bet you know this area well, am I right? Then I bet you can help me find something to eat!"#br##br#
#&53$You smile, telling her that it'd be no problem at all, and ask what she would like to eat.##br##br#
"Ohhh, I would just love a Country Rice Bowl! You do know what that is, right?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sasha##br#
#&53$You're not too sure, but before you get a chance to ask Sasha is already talking again.##br##br#
"I saw some birds outside the village, I think they're called Sunbirds? If you could get some of their meat and eggs, I could whip up a dish that's served over white rice. That's a Country Rice Bowl! Look, I've got my own special recipe right here."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You take the recipe and quickly look over the ingredients.##char$$1$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You realize that you can collect all the listed ingredients in no time and remember that you can simply purchase the rice from a merchant in Port Skandia. It'll probably be a breeze to help out with the maiden's food request.##char$$1$0#|
80082|#&7$Sasha##br#
"A Country Rice Bowl is made with a combination of meat and eggs from poultry. It's so delicious and makes one feel right at home again. I would be so happy if I could have some! I bet it'd make me feel all warm as well."#br##br#
#&53$Sasha looks like she can hardly wait for the meal. You decide to do your best and bring her what she wants to eat.##npc$$824$1#|
80083|#&7$Sasha##br#
"Great! I'm so excited to have this perfect Country Rice Bowl!"#br##br#
#&53$Sasha looks so happy to take the Country Rice Bowl from you. You can't help but smile as she hungrily digs in to her meal.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Sasha##br#
"Here, take this little gift. I am so thankful for your help!"#br##br#
#&53$Sasha hands you a small package. You thank her and accept the gift happily.##npc$$825$1#

#&7$Sasha##br#
"I still haven't found my way back home yet, but I think I'll just stay in Port Skandia until I do. Come back and visit me when you have time. I'd love to have a Country Rice Bowl with you again! You're a great cook!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod and agree to seek Sasha out again before she returns to her home. Hopefully you can become good friends before leaves for her own world.##char$$806$0#|
80084|Sasha would love to have a Country Rice Bowl for her meal. Collect the meat and eggs from the nearby Sunbirds and then find Anita to buy the rice. Then you can make the meal Sasha loves most.|

#&7$Cole##br#
"The Grass Kingdom's been really pushing for a large Thanksgiving celebration lately. We expect many honored guests to show up, so the king wants me to prepare at LEAST one hundred turkeys for the occasion! But I just don't have the time to do it all by myself!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cole##br#
"You are an Envoy of Gaia, right? And a kind hearted one at that, I hear! Can you do me this favor? Please help me roast all these turkeys! If I have even one extra person help with the roasting, I can prepare them much faster."#npc$$821$1#|
80092|#&7$Cole##br#
"At first I considered asking for the Princess to help, but that was a BIG mistake. Not only did she NOT help, she gave me even more to do! She overcooked every single one until they were completely burned black..."#npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
80093|#&7$Cole##br#
"Wow! Could it be true? Have you really finished cooking already? Let me see... They're...perfect! A lovely gold with crispy skin. You have a natural talent here, %n%!"#npcs70h+85$$825$1#

#&7$Cole##br#
"Here, please take these. I couldn't have done this without you! You can keep on roasting turkeys if you want, but you've really done enough. How about taking a break?"#npc$$821$1#|
80094|Help Cole by using the Leaf Fan to roast the turkeys. If the turkey get too hot, you can use the Water Bucket to dowse the flames a bit.|

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"The warm-hearted villagers are busy with their preparations. I believe Port Skandia will soon be bathed in the light of the holy tree."#br##br#
"Are you ready to help plant the Holy Tree?"#br##br#
#&53$The Priest looks at you kindly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You nod, and ask him what you can do to help.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Planting holy trees is no different from planting normal trees. Just water them with Pure Water, and the holy tress will grow."#br##br#
"You can find the right water sauce within Port Skandia."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Here's the bucket you should use to fetch the water. It will filter out any impurities."#br##br#
"When the Holy Tree is fully grown, it will emit a light that blesses the people gathered 'round. And I'm sure you, too, will find inner peace in that light."#br##br#
#&53$The Priest smiles kindly.##npc$$821$1#|
80102|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"I wish you well, young Envoy of Gaia. Everyone in the village is very busy now, yet they all have the same smile on their faces. Maybe the blessings from the Holy Tree have already spread among people."#br##br#
#&53$The Priest smiles, pleased.#npc$$827$1#|
80103|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Thanks for your help with the Holy Tree, young Envoy of Gaia. The Holy Tree will respond to your good deeds."#npc$$827$1#

"That's all for today, regarding the planting of the holy tree. I suggest that you wander around Port Skandia, and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere that christmas and the holy tree have brought."#npc$$2$1#

#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Ah, it's true that one can only truly appreciate the beauty of normalcy, when living a peaceful life."#br##br#
"I wonder if you have the same feeling, Young Envoy of Gaia?"#br##br#

#$&7$Astra##br#
"I've made significant improvements to the chocolate, and I encourage people to give it as a gift, there are still some very shy people who won't deliver it their sweethearts in person. So they ask me to do it instead."#br##br#
#&53$Astra points to the pile of chocolate gift boxes.##npc$$821$1#

#$&7$Astra##br#
"But it takes so long to get the chocolate just right, I can't spare the time to make so many deliveries. Would you be willing to help me out?#br##br#

"You should send that chocolate out! Anyone who receives it as a gift would be really happy."#npc$$821$1#|

@Oh my, oh me... I didn't think I'd ever be able to savor this taste again."#br#

We search far and wide for eggs, and once we find them, we have to paint them. #br#

"Of course, this year is no exception. #br#
However, when the Easter Bunnies went out to collect the eggs,#br#
a group of them accidentally collected some Crocodile Eggs and were attacked.#br#

We brought them back to the nest so they could recover." #npc$$2$1#

"Cole is the laziest of them all. He usually hides near stalls. Don't ask why. #br#
There aren't very many stalls in town, so this one should be easy."

"Honestly, there are only so many places to hide around here. #br#
Look on the rooftops, behind stalls and trees, or in the underbrush. #br#
If you look close enough, I guarantee you won't come out empty-handed."

"Remember, this guy takes his booze seriously. #br#
If you don't deliver the beer on time, it'll go stale and he won't accept it."#npc$$824$1#|
80352|#&7$Jose##br#
"We're hosting a party tonight, #br#
and as per usual there's not enough German Beer to go around. #br#
Any chance you can bring some over from Steven?"#npc$$821$1#|
80353|#&7$Jose##br#
"If tonight ends up being the successful debauchery we've been planning for, #br#
then it'll all be thanks to you,%n%... the purveyor of ale! Hehe. #br#
This here gift is to thank you for your contributions."#npc$$825$1#|
80354|Steven asks you to deliver the German Beer to Jose (653, 458) in under one minute.

"Great work,%n%! #br#
Your knowledge of soccer trivia is unmatched. #br#
Welcome to the family! #br#
I don't suppose you'd be willing to put some work in for the club?" #br#
It's obvious from Steven's tone of voice that this was a rhetorical question.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You smile politely and nod your agreement. #br#
You tell him with only a hint of sarcasm that soccer has always had a place in your heart -- right up there with ironing and cleaning -- and that, by golly, you're willing to do your part!#char$$824$0#

"Tonight we're organizing a World Cup beach party! #br#
Our guests will be expecting food, so we're gonna need several vats of Fish 'n' Chips. #br#

#&7$Steven##br#
"First catch three Codfish, then batter them up and toss 'em in the Fish Fryer. #br#
Your club mates will be drooling with delight when you bring them this delicious finger food."#npc$$824$1#|
80362|#&7$Jose##br#
"Once you've caught three Codfish you chuck 'em into the Fish Fryer #br#
for some of the best Fish 'n' Chips in the realm." #npc$$821$1#|

"My, my... English-style Fish 'n' Chips, cooked to perfection! I should have expected nothing less from you, %n%. #br#
I hope tonight's party will be full of devoted fans like yourself! #br#
Here's a reward for all your hard work."#npc$$825$1#|

#&7$Steven##br#
"There's only type of snail that yields Superior Snail Meat, and that's the Alpine Snail. #br#
The little creature dwells somewhere west of Helonia (626, 226). #br#
Remember, other snails won't yield the right kind of meat!"#npc$$824$1#|

80386|#&7$Narisha##br#
A friendly-looking girl stands beside the Wishing Bamboo. You catch each other's eye at the same time. #br#
"Do you want to make a wish for the well-being of some long-lost friend or... distant lover? #br#
All you gotta do is inscribe your wish on the Wish List and hang it on this Wishing Bamboo. #br#
 The great Vega and Altair will carry these wishes across the realm, spreading their blessings all over!"#npc$$1$1#|
80387|Sounds good. How can I help? (Accept the quest)|
80388|#&7$Narisha##br#
"Oh, dear... Do I really look so depressed?" #br#
Narisha forces a smile, but it's clear that something is troubling her.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"Alright, here's the thing... We've been getting some severe winds recently, #br#
and that's been causing Wish Lists to scatter all over the place!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look around you, but all you see are a few Wish Lists on the ground here and there. #br#
You start to wonder if Narisha is telling the truth. #br#
Suddenly a Long-Tailed Tanuki pops out of nowhere, grabs the remaining Wish Lists and makes a hasty exit.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"May Gaia curse those despicable thieves!!!" Narisha oscillates between fury and despair. #br#
"I considered catching these miserable mice on my own, #br#
but they're just too fast for me; I'd probably end up chasing them all day long. #br#
Not to mention that as soon as I turn my back, they'll steal more Wish Lists. No, I have to take care of the Wishing Bamboo..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Seeing Narisha so depressed makes you uncomfortable. You agree to help her retrieve every last Wish List.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"Really, you'd do that for me?! You're amazing... #br#
Please retrieve at least ten Wish Lists. #br#
In return, I'll give you a Wish List Lucky Pack."#npc$$1$1#|
80389|How do I go about finding these Wish Lists?|
80390|#&7$Narisha##br#
"Those dastardly little thieves!  They're undoubtedly milling about the orchard... #br#
You'll be facing off against Long-Tailed Tanuki, Tanuki, and Deciduous Tanuki. #br#
Once you defeat them you can retrieve the Wish Lists...!" #br#
Narisha's face brightens up visibly at the thought.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"Now, it's only fair to point out that not every Tanuki is a thief. #br#
So keep in mind that it might take some time to find the actual Wish Lists. I'm counting on you! #br#
By the way, even if the Lists turn out to be chewed to pieces, please bring them back anyway."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"They are full of sincere personal wishes, #br#
and I owe it to those people to restore their Wish Lists to their former glory. Please don't throw anything away!"#npc$$1$1#|
80391|#&7$Narisha##br#
"Ah, does an adventurer like you have the time to do me a favor?"#br#
 The smile falls from Narisha's face. Something seems to be troubling her.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"Because the wind has been so strong lately,#br#
@the Wish Lists keep getting blown off the Wishing Bamboo..." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
You look at the ground around you and do not see any Wish Lists.#br#
 Just as you start to doubt Narisha's claims,#br#
 you see a Long-Tailed Bandit Mouse clutching a colorful Wish List.#char$$823$0#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"Those despicable thieves!!!" Narisha insults the bandit mouse scurrying off into the distance.#br#
"I want to go after those little thieves myself,#br#
 but I'd have to spend a whole day chasing after them...#br#
 They'd just steal more Wish Lists while I'm at it... and I have to look after the Wishing Bamboo..." #npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
Seeing Narisha's distress, you offered to retrieve the Wish Lists. #char$$822$0#

#&7$Narisha##br#
"Would you really?! You're so kind..#br#
 I hope you can find at least ten or so Wish Lists.#br#
 I'll reward you with this gift box."#npc$$823$1#|
80392|#&7$Narisha##br#
"I hope you can get ten intact Wish Lists back from those Long-Tailed Bandit Mice.#br#
 Thank you!"#npc$$822$1#|
80393|#&7$Narisha##br#
"Thank you so much!" Narisha happily accepts the Wish Lists you collected.#br#
@"Now I can hang everyone's wishes up and hope they come true!" #npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
 Just as Narisha finishes speaking, another large gust of wind blew past.#br#
@You see lots of Wish Lists get blown off the bamboo leaves. The colorful lists fall like confetti...#br#
 Tanuki immediately swarm and sweep away the Wish Lists. #char$$828$0#

#&7$Narisha##br#
@Narisha shoves the gift box she mentioned before into your hands.#br#
"It's no problem. I will stay strong!"#npc$$828$1#|

"Hmm, this is not a Pristine Proposal Flower. This one is only Mediocre...Looks like I better keep searching!"#npc$$828$1#|
90066|Remove the Proposal Flower.|
90067|Give the Lovely Proposal Flower to Kirk.|
90068|#&7$Kirk##br#
"This is not the Pristine Proposal Flower either. It's just a Lovely Proposal Flower...it's ok, but...I need the best! You're gonna have to keep searching!...Please!"#npc$$828$1#|
90069|#&7$Kirk##br#
"Thank you for helping me look for the Pristine Proposal Flower. With this flower, and thanks to your bravery, I will have the courage to propose to my girl!"#npc$$824$1#|
90070|#&7$Kirk##br#
"I appreciate your help in finding the Pristine Proposal Flower. With you here, I'm sure I'll be able to get my hands on one!"#npc$$824$1#|
90071|(The legendary Proposal Flower, it's exactly what Kirk wants.)|
90072|#&7$Kirk##br#
"This flower is not a Pristine Proposal Flower...Please keep looking for one!"#npc$$824$1#|
90073|Brother...what am I to do...?|
90074|Wait! Hear me out first. Don't just go in all recklessly!|
90075|La la la! We are happily mowing!|
90076|Stop torturing me, please! I will show you the way...|
90077|Hey, it's me! I've finished mowing, can you open the door?|
90078|Be careful! As soon as the door opens I'm gonna run for it!|
90079|Thank you for sparing my life! I'll be on my way now...|
90080|I'm counting on you! Please bring my brother back...I'll be waiting!|
90081|Waah! Please don't kill me! I'll do whatever you want!|
90082|Outsiders! Alarm!|
90083|Alert everybody and get us help, now!|
90084|Ok, I will ask everybody to come right away!|
90085|Ha! Fresh meat! I'm going to eat well!|
90086|Waaah! Don't come any closer!|
90087|Hahaha!|
90088|Uh...V...Valerie...|
90089|Woo! Finally somebody to rescue me! Get me out of this cage!|
90090|Great! Now let's get outta here!|
90091|Curses! It might be the Cenobite King...|
90092|Please, you must defeat him! I don't know how to fight, so I'll just stay out of your way.|
90093|Thank you so much! Let's get out of here!|
90094|I'm so excited! I can't wait to see my sister again!|
90095|Valerie, I'm so sorry that you had to worry about me!|
90096|We were lucky this time, brother, that this brave soul was able to help us! Don't you ever be so reckless again!|
90097|Ok, I know better now. I won't do that again!|
90098|#&7$Valerie##br#
"Mother has an illness that doctors say can only be cured by Infinity Grass. Once my brother, James, heard this, he went to Oblivio Expanse in search of some..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"He's been gone for two whole days now! I'm so worried! I wanted to go into the forest to look for him, but it's full of ferocious beasts and other creepy things, so I had to turn back..."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Valerie##br#
"I don't know how to fight so I sent in an urgent request for help. Are you the one who's come to help? Please! Help me find my brother and the Infinity Grass to save my mother!"#npc$$2$1#|
90099|Don't worry, I can handle this!|
90100|#&7$Valerie##br#
"You...You're not here to help me, are you? Then please leave. I'm waiting for someone...!"#npc$$823$1#|
90101|#&7$Valerie##br#
"Thank you for helping me! Be safe out there!"#npc$$824$1#|
90102|#&7$Cenobite Clansman##br#
"Please! Don't hurt me! I'm just a farmer, simply mowing outside the village... Don't kill me. I'll do whatever you say!"#npcs85h+70$$828$1#|
90103|Tell me! Where's the Infinity Grass?|
90104|#&7$Cenobite Clansman##br#
"Infinity Grass? We don't see that around very often! However...if memory serves, our boss, the Cenobite King...he always carries Infinity Grass with him!"#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Cenobite Clansman##br#
"That's all I know, honest! Please don't kill me!"#npc$$829$1#|
90105|Tell me, now! Where's James?|
90106|#&7$Cenobite Clansman##br#
"Ah, James? Oh yes! Could that be the boy that broke into our village two days ago? He was a bit unlucky...Usually we just chase intruders out of our village right away."#npcs85h+70$$821$1#

#&7$Cenobite Clansman##br#
"However, we are currently holding our annual ritual to the Demon Flowertrap. This ritual involves an offering of the freshest meat to to our man-eating Demon Flowertrap..."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Cenobite Clansman##br#
"We were a bit short on fresh meat this year, so we captured the boy to be used in the sacrifice. I know you must want to save him, but our village is securely shut down for the time being, and you won't be able to get in."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Cenobite Clansman##br#
"That's all I know about your friend James. Please, may I go?"#npc$$828$1#|
90107|Shut up and lead the way! (The plot continues...)|
90108|(Eh, forget it...As the saying goes, 'live to fight another day'. I'll come back later when I'm more prepared...)|
90109|Help...Somebody help me...Oooh...|
90110|Brother! You're alright!|
90111|I'm so tired of all this mowing!|
90112|Don't you dare try to destroy the ceremony and steal my Infinity Grass!|
90113|I'm free! Hooray!|
90114|#&7$James##br#
"Whew, I thought I'd never get out of there alive! I hope I can see my sister again..."#npc$$829$1#|
90115|Hey, Ray! Didn't you say you were gonna beat me this time?|
90116|Hrmph! Of course I did! I'll do it right now! Hey, sis! Look at me kicking our big brother's butt!|
90117|Brothers, it's kinda scary here...Let's go home, ok?|
90118|No! Not before I kick his butt!|
90119|No! Not before they suffer the bitter loss of defeat!|
90120|Cut to the chase, let's begin! Let's see who can throw a stone the furthest!|
90121|Hmph, easy! I'll go first!|
90122|Ah!|
90123|Watch this! 2-throw combo!|
90124|Hahaha, hilarious! You call that a 2-throw combo?! How weak!|
90125|Watch me now! Haa!|
90126|Unrivaled superpowered throw!|
90127|Well, look at that! I threw it further than you!|
90128|Darn, that doesn't count! Let's go again!|
90129|Fine. I'm not afraid of anything!|
90130|Then do it already! You go first this time!|
90131|What...What happened...?|
90132|What's going on...|
90133|Aha! It's here!|
90134|Sorry to bother you!|

"My children are so ornery. They're always misbehaving! I told them not to go into the ruins at the Oblivio Expanse, but they did anyway..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"The ruins there are very dangerous. Some sort of terrible monster could pop up at any moment."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"I told them this, but they just wouldn't listen! I'm old, so I couldn't move quickly enough to stop them, and I don't have the strength to bring them back..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Tyrone##br#
"So, I'm begging you, before they manage to stir up some monster that they shouldn't, to bring them safely back to me. I'm counting on you!"#npc$$822$1#|
90136|No problem. I'll bring them back safe and sound!|
90137|#&7$Tyrone##br#

"My younger brother Ray is always trying to one-up me. As his older brother, there's no way I'm gonna let that go. I'll show him what I'm made of!"#npc$$826$1#|
90139|Whatever. We're going back, now!|
90140|#&7$Naughty Louis##br#
"No way! We can't go back now! We just got here! I need to finish my match with Ray! How about you protect us while we finish?"#npc$$827$1#|
90141|#&7$Mischievous Ray##br#
"I gotta show my brother Louis that I can't be pushed around. He needs to see that I'm strong! Then maybe he won't treat me like a little kid anymore."#npc$$826$1#|
90142|Your father is worried sick about you. Let's go back now, ok?|
90143|#&7$Mischievous Ray##br#
"Yeah, but this is important! Our match isn't finished! Can I at least beat my brother before we go home? Please? You can stand over there and watch!"#npc$$827$1#|
90144|#&7$Timid Reina##br#
"My two brothers are so annoying. They never stop fighting. It's really scary out here. Can we please-please go home?"#npc$$829$1#|
90145|Yikes! Help!|
90146|Monsters! Get out of here!!|
90147|Help! Someone save me!|
90148|#&7$Tyrone##br#
"Young one, I'm begging you to please go to the ruins in the Oblivio Expanse and bring my children back!" #npc$$821$1#|
90149|#&7$Naughty Louis##br#
"This sucks! if I was stronger, I could easily protect my brother and sister!"#npc$$826$1#|
90150|#&7$Mischievous Ray##br#
"I've never seen so many scary monsters! Even my brother struggles with them...I need to get stronger so that I can protect him!"#npc$$823$1#|
90151|#&7$Timid Reina##br#
"This is so scary!! I really want to go home now! Please, let's just go home! I'll never run off with my stupid brothers ever again!"#npc$$829$1#|
90152|This sucks! If only I could fight those monsters on my own...|
90153|If my brother can't even stand a chance, I'm done for...|
90154|I really, really want to go home now!!|
90155|What are they saying...?!|
90156|Scared...I'm so scared...!|
90157|Please get rid of these monsters for us! I'll take my brother and sister and hide!|
90158|Ray, Reina, let's get out of here, we're going home!|
90159|That person helped us defeat those monsters. We're going home now.|
90160|Dad, we're back!|
90161|Oh, thank goodness! You're all safe! I'm so glad...|
90162|Sorry, Dad. We won't run off like that again...|
90163|That's good, as long as you're safe. Come now, let's go home!|
90164|Oh no, I see enemies up ahead... We must be such a pain for you. I'll hide my brother and sister behind you so that we're safe and out of the way.|
90165|#&7$Tyrone##br#
"I'm so relieved to see all my children back safe!" #npc$$824$1#|
90166|Hello. Is there something I can help with?|
90167|#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"In fact, there is! If you're here to help, hurry and help me! That pack of Golden Flowertraps is going to eat my entire pile of gold! If they eat it all, I'll be penniless!"#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"There are rumors that there is something those Golden Flowertraps love even more than gold. That is Scrumptious Mushrooms... That sounds absurd compared to gold, but it's true!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"But actually picking those things is something else. I can't sell anything if my delicate hands are soiled. Also, I heard that those mushrooms are poisonous. What if I accidentally ingest some mushroom residue?! So, it's obvious that I'm not suited for the job. But you look perfect for it! I just need someone to help me pick enough Scrumptious Mushrooms to draw away those Golden Flowertraps."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"Ah, I almost forgot - there are different types and sizes of Golden Flowertraps, so there are different methods to attracting them. I don't know the details, though... But I'm sure you'll figure it out!"#npc$$821$1#|
90168|Scrumptious Mushrooms! I want them all!|
90169|#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"Oh no, I literally looked everywhere and didn't see anything... Where exactly is it hidden?" #npc$$828$1#|
90170|Um...what are you looking for?|
90171|#&7$Merchant's Assistant##br#
"Oh, thank you kindly! Not only did you help my master, but, more importantly... I got something to eat! This is wonderful!"#npc$$824$1#|
90172|What should we do?|
90173|#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"I have a Favorite Mushroom stashed away somewhere... I was saving it as part of a big feast. I guess I have no choice but to use my Pristine Gold. #npc$$824$1#|
90174|I'm looking for my Pristine Gold... It is a my most precious possession!|
90175|I just used my one-of-a-kind communicator to call my assistant. He should be here at any moment!|
90176|#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"Work quickly with my assistant to find my hidden Favorite Mushroom. Use that to draw out that detestable Eater of Gold and retrieve my Pristine Gold!" #npc$$824$1#|
90177|My mushrooms...scrumptious mushrooms...must eat them all...|
90178|It's really here! An abandoned robot...|
90179|Humans...cruel...why...abandon...?|
90180|Why...was I...abandoned.?|
90181|Humans...invaders...annihilate...|
90182|Abandoned...remove...humans...|
90183|Wow, this is scarier than I thought it would be. I'm glad you're here to help!|
90184|We can't rest; there are so many Abandoned Robots around here.|
90185|Look there! Those look like broken, immobile bots...|
90186|These bots aren't damaged to the point where they can't be repaired, yet they were still abandoned. I don't understand why...|
90187|Whoa...over there!|
90188|Be careful, I heard something back there!|
90189|Someone could be hiding back there. You really can't let your guard down!|
90190|Wow, more of them. There are so many!|
90191|Shh...Listen... That sounds...like a lot of robots...|
90192|Brace yourself, this is gonna get rough!|
90193|Whew...finally over! Having you here sure makes a difference!|
90194|Look how these bots were dumped here. How sad...|
90195|If Humans can recycle their trash, why can't they fix their robots?|
90196|Humans...identified...remove...quickly...|
90197|Hi! You're here to help me, aren't you!|
90198|We've cleared all the danger, let's go!|
90199|Battling robots is a lot of hard work! I don't understand why people would just throw all that effort away...|
90200|I never knew there were this many abandoned robots here. This is terrible...|
90201|Wait...! Hey, look there! There's a robot just standing there. Let's check it out!|
90202|Let me have a look at it...|
90203|Yes...Yes...|
90204|Weird - I don't see anything wrong with it. Why was it just left here?|
90205|Woah!...it's moving!|
90206|Awesome, it can still move! Maybe it'll want to come back with us.|
90207|Do you...understand what I'm saying?|
90208|I could really use a robot like you to compete with me.|
90209|Maybe it'll help out my dad. He's just been so sad...|
90210|Will you come with me to participate in the competition?|
90211|I...I think it understands!|
90212|Does that mean you agree? Awesome! Let's get out of here.|
90213|Wait...What's that noise?|
90214|Thank you so much! Now I can take Blockhead back and reconfigure him for battle.|
90215|This is not good! Not all humans are what you think! For my father's sake, I'll defeat you and take Blockhead back!|
90216|Alright, we did it!|
90217|I hope we can get through this...|
90218|Hehehe... how about you 'join me for dinner'?|
90219|#&7$Meira##br#
"I'm so, so happy! Thank you so very much! I'll always remember you, I promise. Someday, I'll definitely return the favor." #npc$$822$1#|
90220|I must be prepared!|
90221|Aah!|
90222|Oh wow, it's finally starting!|
90223|Yes, it's finished!|
90224|#&7$Timid Reina##br#
"Oh, I would love to go back with you! But my stupid brothers need to decide who's better...again...Can you tell them to stop it so we can go home?" #npc$$829$1#|
90225|Loudly announce that you have Scrumptious Mushrooms.|
90226|Set the Scrumptious Mushrooms on the ground.|
90227|Do I...do I smell Scrumptious Mushrooms?|
90228|Must eat all the Scrumptious Mushrooms!|
90229|Scrumptious Mushrooms! Mine mine!!|
90230|No, they're mine!|
90231|Mine!|
90232|I'll fight you for them!|
90233|I must have them, too!|
90234|Just a second, he's almost here...|
90235|Alright, finally! Go with him to find my Favorite Mushroom!|
90236|#&7$Valerie##br#
"Thank you so much! Good people deserve to be rewarded!" #npc$$822$1#|
90237|Oh, please listen to me! I need your help...|
90238|I'll make sure to stay close! Please be careful!|
90239|#&7$Demon Recruit##br#
"Alright, satisfactory! I guess I'll open the gate to let you pass..." #npc$$822$1#|
90240|#&7$Demon Recruit##br#
"Wait just a second there! We didn't order any food!" #M122040$Demon Recruit$1021$1#

#&7$Demon Recruit##br#
"You must be someone sent here by the Sprites. Intruder!! Attack!!" #M122040$Demon Recruit$827$1#
|
90241|It's all on you now. Don't do something stupid!|
90242|I pray that the warrior can save my sister and the Sprites, to preserve peace...|
90243|Sister, are you okay? I'll have you out of here soon!|
90244|Don't worry, I'm here. I'll open the cage as soon as I can.|
90245|Okay, it's open!|
90246|Ah...|
90247|Oh no, what happened to you?!|
90248|Here, let me help you!|
90249|I must treat my sister now, or she might die!|
90250|Please...continue on to the Altar...rescue the Sprite... We're counting on you.|
90251|Kill...all who try to save...the Sprites...!|
90252|Who is that? Is that a demon talking?|
90253|This is terrible! I must save my sister!|
90254|Don't worry, I'll save the Sprite.|
90255|It's open! Success!|
90256|I'm so glad, we saved the Sprite!|
90257|Yes, I'm so relieved!|
90258|It's all thanks to our brave hero here. Thank you so much!|
90259|#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"Thank you for saving us! My sister and I will work hard to better protect this area. We'll also grow stronger 
so that this sort of thing never happens again!" #npc$$821$1#|
90260|#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"I must thank you and my sister for rescuing and healing me. I may not be standing here otheriwse... Lola and I would routinely place barriers here together to prevent evil from penetrating the area." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"This time, the demons took advantage of Lola being away and attacked. My magical barrier is weak on its own, so they successfully broke through. We'll think of a more efficient system for setting up the barrier in the future so that an issue like this never happens again." #npc$$822$1#|
90261|(What luck. Working out here for the first time and this happens...)|
90262|You'll be alright, I'll take you home!|
90263|#&7$James##br#
"Awesome, thanks! I'll make sure to stay close behind you." #npc$$829$1#|
90264|Oh, right - he has the Infinity Grass! Please, you must defeat him and get it!|
90265|#&7$James##br#
"Thanks a lot! If not for you, I'd already be dinner for the Demon Flowertrap in the Evil Priest Village..."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$James##br#
"You also helped me get the Infinity Grass. Now my sister and can cure Mom. We'll take care of her and be the best kids for her so all your hard work is not in vain!" #npc$$829$1#|
90266|Please hurry and defeat Trollclops for his Infinity Grass. My sister is waiting for us!|
90267|Hahaha, you dare fight a demon god! You fool!|
90268|I'll go on ahead and take a look.|
90269|Yikes, there's a ferocious-looking monster just up ahead. You'll probably need to defeat it before we can go forward!|
90270|#&7$Kirk##br#
"We can't stop now. I know we'll find that Pristine Proposal Flower if we push hard enough. Let's keep moving!"#npc$$824$1#|
90271|The Golden Flowertraps are back! Go stop them from eating more of a my gold!|
90272|Alright, some are down. That's less to deal with now!|
90273|
#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"Picking Scrumptious Mushrooms is such hard, dirty work; I'm sure my hands will cramp up! Besides, those mushrooms are considered poisonous. I just can't risk it! 
Therefore I need you to pick Scrumptious Mushrooms for me in order to draw away those Golden Flowertraps."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"Ah, I almost forgot - there are different types and sizes of Golden Flowertraps, #br#
so there are different methods to attracting them. #br#
I don't know the details, though...#br#
But I'm sure you'll figure it out!" #npc$$821$1#|
90274|If these things aren't stopped, all my gold will be devoured in no time! Aagh!|
90275|#&7$Greedy Merchant Sheldon##br#
"You've got to help me! The best way to distract the Golden Flowertraps is to pick some Scrumptious Mushrooms.
But you have to hurry! They're going to eat up all my gold if you don't get them out of there!" #npc$$829$1#|
90276|Mmm, scrumptious mushrooms! Gimme!|
90277|Feeeed meeee!|
90278|Thank you, my hero!|
90279|Mmm, thanks for this delicious food to eat!|
90280|Pardon me, but...who are you?|
90281|#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"Greetings, I am Sister Lola, the priestess protecting this altar. For many centuries we have served the Sprites of this land so that they will impart upon us their blessing. The Sprites work hard to keep our world in perfect harmony and prevent the evils of Pandemonium from creeping into our world."#npc$$822$1#|
90282|What is the Sprite Altar's true purpose?|
90283|#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"The Sprite Altar is a place for the most powerful Sprites to gather and work their magic to bless our world. On certain days, they arrive to perform a ceremony  seals our world, protecting it from evil. The Sprites preserve the perfect balance of life and peace through the world this way."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"The demons who want to destroy our world have discovered a gap in our defenses! They've attacked the altar during a ceremony, capturing the most powerful Sprites. We believe they intend to sacrifice them to corrupt the balance of life and death."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Sister Lola##br#
"If these demons are successful in their sacrifice, they will soon be able to overrun us and take over the entire world. This is why we have sought help. We need someone with the strength to overcome these demons. We have no time to waste, Envoy of Gaia!"#npc$$828$1#|
90284|It's the great and powerful Flowertrap Lord! Run away!|
90285|This Pristine Gold Nugget was discovered in a secret cave by my great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!|
90286|It emits a strange and powerful energy that seems to attract customers and encourages them to purchase our wares.|
90287|This is why our family has been so wealthy for many generations...|
90288|When abandoned like this, robots tend to become increasingly resentful. There must be a better way to deal with unwanted robots...|
90289|When full of resentment, robots become more and more powerful! However, since they have not been ordered to go to battle, they just continue to wait and gain even more power.|
90290|I...still...need...to fight...|
90291|If...you...need...me...|
90292|I...will...fight...for...you...|
90293|But...I...am...in...disrepair...|
90294|My...parts...must be...fixed...before...I can fight...|
90295|Also...|
90296|Yes? Also what?|
90297|Whoa...who is that?|
90298|Join Blockhead and Father! Win the championship!|
90299|We will work together and tell everyone never to abandon their robots again!|

"The Moon Water Flower is considered holy in our village. It's also a favorite flower amongst the Sprites. If you can make a crown out of Moon Water Flowers, it is said that the Sprites will bless it with their power."#npc$$821$1#|
90301|Gather enough Moon Water Flowers so that we can weave a Flower Crown!|
90302|Be on the lookout for wild and ferocious creatures while picking the Moon Water Flowers!|
90303|Just a moment...Let me weave these Moon Water Flowers into a beautiful Flower Crown!|
90304|Yes...ok...this one goes here...and this one...|
90305|Alright! The Flower Crown is completed! Isn't it lovely?|
90306|Now we bring it to the Priestess and ask permission to place it upon the Altar!|
90307|Yes, I understand. Thank you.|
90308|Success! Let's keep going!|
90309|Congratulations, you've passed the trials! You can now wear this Blessed Flower Crown!|
90310|Now, take the Flower Crown in your hands.|
90311|Hand the Moon Water Flowers you picked to Meira.|
90312|#&7$Meira##br#
"I don't think this is enough Moon Water Flowers to make a crown with. Go pick some more, won't you? I think you'll need at least five, ok? Thank you! Do be careful about the wild beasts that the Priestess spoke of!"#npc$$821$1#|
90313|Nice! It's a perfect Flower Crown!|
90314|Please wait while I try to have it blessed by the Sprites!|
90315|Okay, finished!|
90316|Come forward and collect it.|
90317|Wonderful! Thank you, Sprites!|
90318|I hope that this will bring happiness to everyone! I must rest now. Until next time!|
90319|Thank you, kind Envoy, for enduring the trials for me so that I could get this wonderful Blessed Flower Crown!|
90320|Would you do me the honor of picking five Moon Water Flowers for me? Be mindful of the beasties out there!|
90321|There are three slightly bigger, yellow ones that you should defeat.|
90322|Follow me...come...  |
90323|Who's there?! Oh man, I'm starting to get paranoid....|
90324|Get away from here, it's too dangerous to pass through!|
90325|Fire..fire...it's on fire!|
90326|Run for it, there's a fire!|
90327|So you're the one that's been messing around! Get over here!|
90328|Intruders spotted!!|
90329|Who is it?!|
90330|Al's father suddenly appears in front of you.|
90331|Quick, this place is about to collapse! Follow me....|
90332|Allie....  |
90333|Live...well....  |
90334|Al....|
90335|Dad...is that you?|
90336|I'll look after Al, so please don't worry....|
90337|...  |
90338|Sister...sister....|
90339|Al! Are you all right?|
90340|Sis... Dad brought me here. Where is he?|
90341|Dad went to bust those bad guys. Once he's through, he'll be back....  |
90342|Dad is amazing. Sis, why are you crying?  |
90343|I-I won't talk about Dad anymore, so please stop crying....|
90344|C'mon, let's go. I'll look after you now.|
90345|When Al grows up, he'll look after his sister.|
90346|Didn't master say you couldn't smoke here? Who's been smoking?|
90347|Wait, that's not cigarette smoke... It smells almost like barbecue....|
90348|It's a fire! Oh, no!|
90349|What is going on out here?|
90350|How did the fire get so big? Quick, put it out!|
90351|Nothing's wrong here!|
90352|Is it just me, or do I get the strange sense that someone's watching me?|
90353|Patrolling is so boring; I feel like a nap.|
90354|Nothing... Wrong!|
90355|My shift will end soon....  |
90356|Did I not say there was an intruder?|
90357|They think they can steal our food?!|
90358|Give me back my daughter!!|
90359|Shut up. Death is just around the corner, and you keep running your mouth.|
90360|Dad....  |
90361|Allie....  |
90362|#&7$Al##br#
"Thanks...."  |
90363|What a bunch of scallywags! They let the intruders come here.  |
90364|You burnt down my fort! You'll pay for this!!|
90365|Oh, wow...I can't believe it....  |
90366|So naive.|
90367|Hand over your money and your life!|
90368|You won't leave here alive!|
90369|I'm here, so quiet down! The guards will hear you.|
90370|Who are you? You found our stash....  |
90371|You won't leave here alive!|
90372|#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"Greetings, brave warrior. I'm the person that 's been seeking help. My name is Llewelyn; I'm a priest of Lycra Village. I hope to rescue the villagers who have strayed here, but I can only do so much. Unfortunately, I can't fight off the monsters here."#npc$$821$1#|
90373|#&7$Llewelyn##br#
If she targeted you, she'll try to turn you into an animal. I never used to believe it, but the villagers have started to disappear. One of them barely managed to escape; he claimed to see his father turn into a goat and run off!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"Rumors like these just wouldn't stop; I decided to take a look for myself. That's when I discovered power energy waves deep within the village. Mudlings in the area have become violent. I tried to get past them, but I'm not match for their aggression."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"The missing villagers must be inside the village! Please aid me with your strength!"#npc$$821$1#|
90374|The curse is gone! Thank you! Thank you!|
90375|I thought I'd be stuck here forever.|
90376|Oh wow, I'm human again!|
90377|Die, die, die!|
90378|Blast it!|
90379|I...was found out....|
90380|How terrible....|
90381|Gods, please grant me the power of Gaia.|
90382|Dispel the poison!|
90383|Follow the light; I'll protect you from the evil invaders.|
90384|#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"Greetings, brave warrior. I'm the person that 's been seeking help. My name is Llewelyn; I'm a priest of Lycra Village. I hope to rescue the villagers who have strayed here, but I can only do so much. Unfortunately, I can't fight off the monsters here."#npc$$821$1#|
90385|You've come to rescue me?! Thank you!|
90386|I never want to see this place again.|
90387|I can't stand it here anymore!|
90388|You're too late....|
90389|These Humans will become part of me.|
90390|What happened here?|
90391|Regarding the poison fog ahead.|
90392|#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"The poisonous mist up ahead is one of the witch's curses. Anyone who enters the mist will be turned into an animal. Be careful not to rush through it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"I can get rid of the fog, but I'll need time to work up the spell. When you're ready, allow me to clear the mist before you enter."#npc$$821$1#|
90393|Ask about the Sacred Barrier.|
90394|#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"The Sacred Barrier is powered by prayer; curses are ineffective within the protected area. Be certain to not go anywhere without the barrier. Keep in mind that I can only create one Barrier at a time, so be patient if it takes me a moment to create another."#npc$$821$1#|
90395|I can't go on by myself. If I do....  |
90396|I'm so glad you're here! I'm the priest known as Llewelyn.|
90397|You will end up just like the idiots I tricked into coming here! You will be a sacrifice for my ritual!|
90398|OK, let's go save the villagers! (Begin Event)|
90399|#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"Excellent! Let's go."#npc$$821$1#|
90400|#&7$Llewelyn##br#
"Thank you...#M108021$Llewelyn$823$1#|
90401|#&7$Lilian##br#
"We're saved, finally! I used to think it was easy to come and go. It started out easy. Now the area's surrounded by Mudlings; when did that happen? Stranger still is the fact that I couldn't use my magic at all. I've been such an idiot!"#br##br#
#&53$Lilian takes in a deep breath to calm down.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lilian##br#
"I'm Lilian, a witch. Don't be afraid, I have no reason to hurt you. A powerful magic drew me here. I thought it was a place where other witches lived."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lilian##br#
"This is quite intricate magic, even for a witch like me. I think someone was trying to seize the power that was left here by other witches. Whoever made the attempt had no way to control it. Now it controls them. If the idiot was human, he or she is human no longer."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lilian##br#
"The energy I feel is coming from deep within the village. We won't know who's behind this until we go there. A miasma covers this forest; humans can't get through it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lilian##br#
"I'm still recovering, so I'm not yet strong enough to use my magic. Our mysterious opponent disabled my powers. Are you willing to help me? We can only get through if we work together. Think about it and let me know."#npc$$821$1#|
90402|Lead the way (Begin Event)!|
90403|Stay close. I won't wait for you.|
90404|I will not lose to a demon wearing human skin!|
90405|So this monster even ate the soul? I'll never forgive that!|
90406|Descend, Dark Thunderbolts!!|
90407|The more I study mudlings, the more disgusting they seem.|
90408|This mild miasma....  |
90409|Destroy....|
90410|...  |
90411|Were you discovered...? Oh, it hurts...! We have to enter the village...and save everyone!|
90412|These villagers....  |
90413|They don't smell like humans.|
90414|How strange. It's as though the villagers are trapped inside a flower... But which one?|
90415|These villagers are so suspicious....  |
90416|Two here, one big and one small....  |
90417|How long are they going to hide for?|
90418|I feel an evil presence...!  |
90419|Blast! You've tricked me into revealing my true form! But you will not escape....|
90420|You have to wait before I can cast again!|
90421|Shh... we're surrounded.|
90422|I despise mudlings. I'm a lady! How could I touch something so disgusting?|
90423|There are many types of witches just as there are many types of people. Aren't there good people and bad people?|
90424|It's clear for now. Pass though while you can.|
90425|Many warriors have come here, but none have made it back unharmed.  |
90426|Mudlings are so gross....    |
90427|#&7$Bright Red Flower##br#
"Please, save me!"#br##br#
#&53$That flower didn't just speak, did it? Perplexed, you try to get closer.##npcs70h+85$$821$1#

#&7$Bright Red Flower##br#
"Save me!"#br##br#
#&53$The Red Flower is talking again! You move closer still.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bright Red Flower##br#
"I need you to help me break this Red Flower's seal."#br##br#
#&53$The voice is definitely coming from inside the Red Flower.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Bright Red Flower##br#
"All you need to do is pick the flower to break its seal, then the curse on me will be lifted. Are you here for the lost villagers? I can help you save them, you must believe me! Just please let me out."#npc$$821$1#|
90428|You pick the Red Flower (Starting Event).|
90429|#&7$Bright Red Flower##br#
"Thank you."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
90430|Go away, you obnoxious mudlings!|
90431|You must save the others!|
90432|Others are still trapped inside! You must save them!|
90433|Go quickly, don't delay!|
90434|Let me try! Lightning, heed my call!|
90435|The mudlings have transformed. That means we have to destroy them... How gross!!|
90436|This power is suppressing my magic again... You'll need to take care of the mudlings.|
90437|The sorcery that has bound me has vanished! But, wait - I think I hear someone calling out for help!|
90438|I think someone's trapped! Hurry and find them!|
90439|The situation is dire; don't waste time!|
90440|I've spent too much energy resisting the seal. You'll have to take care of the Mudling King.|
90441|This evil power... It's coming from the altar!  |
90442|I'm saved!|
90443|I can go back and see my family now! I thought I'd die here!|
90444|I never thought the demon would use the priest.  |
90445|I almost died!|
90446|Thank you, hero!|
90447|Thank you so much!|
90448|Let me get rid of this miasma. Wait a moment, please.|
90449|Even better!|
90450|Wonderful! Let's be off!|
90451|#&7$Lilian##br#
"Wow, you're stronger than I thought! The priest and the demon tainted the remaining magic here, which is why things got to this point. Don't worry, though, I'll eliminate this magic. Let a professional witch take care of this."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lilian##br#
"I first came here to find other witches. Most villages kick out witches like me, so it gets lonely sometimes. So, when I felt a witch's power, I thought I had finally met someone else like me. Imagine my disappointment when I learned the truth."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lilian##br#
"People always think that all witches are evil, so that's all I'm used to from them. I may not have found other witches, but I did find someone who is willing to place their trust in a witch. Thank you. You don't know how rare it is for me to actually thank someone."#npc$$821$1#|
90452|Please go find the flower that has villagers trapped inside.|
90453|I'm so worried that using magic to break the flower's seal will hurt the villagers.|
90454|This formidable devilry... it's simply terrifying!|
90455|Has anyone seen my husband?|
90456|Is my child OK?|
90457|I can't muster the power....|
90458|I'll recover in no time....|
90459|I won't lose....|
90460|Charge!|
90461|Attack!|
90462|Ahhhhhh!|
90463|Who would have thought someone would be stupid enough to charge in all alone...|
90464|We can't lose to them! Charge!|
90465|The... Charm Queen?|
90466|It's a trap! Don't be fooled!|
90467|I don't care if it's a trap! I can handle this.|
90468|Disappeared?|
90469|Is the enemy wasting our time?|
90470|There's something fishy about this place. Odum, you take the lead!|
90471|Despicable...  |
90472|This is no simple trap!|
90473|We've got to catch up!|
90474|Is this a puppet or a phantom?|
90475|Can you guess whether I'm real or fake? Hehehehe.|
90476|I'm the real one!|
90477|Heh!|
90478|Can't guess, can't guess!|
90479|Damn! Don't run off!|
90480|I can't believe someone could just dash off like that.  |
90481|Didn't wait at all...  |
90482|So careless...  |
90483|I didn't expect them to use that kind of spell!|
90484|I don't have enough power...|
90485|Since everyone's here, we can get started!|
90486|How disappointing...|
90487|Is this the same old trap?|
90488|I'll kill the first one to step forward!|
90489|Looks like I'll have to slaughter them all!|
90490|Watch out!|
90491|Could this be another trap?|
90492|Odum, are you ready? We're going to attack!|
90493|How about a little competition? Let's see who kills more bad guys!|
90494|We'll take care of the frontline. The rest of you, cover us!|
90495|Copy that!|
90496|We're ready. Let's kick some butt!|
90497|Oh!|
90498|How's the battle going?|
90499|Sir! Alex has started to attack!|
90500|I don't know.|
90501|Okay. I'll forge ahead and provide support!|
90502|Please! Be careful!|
90503|Have we won?|
90504|Could it really be that easy?|
90505|Right. Could it really be that easy?|
90506|The Charm Queen must still be nearby.|
90507|Para and will lead the pursuit.|
90508|You're a fool if you think you can beat me like that!|
90509|I'll play with you again later...|
90510|I'll leave you to clear this up.|
90511|Another fool who wants to die, eh?|
90512|Let's move!|
90513|Let's kick some butt!|
90514|I never expected this kind of monster!  |
90515|What?|
90516|I knew it was fake!  |
90517|Hmph! I knew it couldn't be that simple!|
90518|#&7$Reymon##br#
"Now you can start taming the otter.#br#
Once you're ready, come to me and I'll give you the Taming Tools.#br#
Feel free to ask me any questions you might have. Relax, otters aren't that hard to tame."#npc$$821$1#|
90519|Exactly how do you tame otters?|
90520|#&7$Reymon##br#
"Taming an otter is not actually that hard.#br#
First, you need to feed the otter to lower its guard.#br#
But pay attention - how the otter responds is the key to the whole taming process."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reymon##br#
"If the otter's status changes to Enraged, you'll have to teach it a lesson#br#
and remind the otter who's calling the shots here.#br#
If its status changes to Anxious, pet the otter and calm it down."#npc$$821$1#Repeat this several times and you and the otter should get along fine."#npc$$821$1#|
90521|Give me the Taming Tools.|
90522|#&7$Reymon##br#
"Here you are, and good luck!#br#
Pierre is busy preparing as we speak. Clearing landmines is no easy task, after all."#npc$$821$1#|
90523|#&7$Reymon##br#
"Now you have the tools.#br#
Go tame the otter! The clock is ticking,#br#
and Pierre should be ready any minute now."#npc$$821$1#|
90524|You did it! You've tamed the otter!|
90525|#&7$Reymon##br#
"You and the otter seem to have a special bond!#br#
Pierre should be ready now.#br#
Please join him and clear all the landmines."#br#
|
90526|#&7$Reymon##br#
"It doesn't look like this otter has been tamed.#br#
Are you sure you know what you're doing?"#npc$$821$1#|
90527|#&7$Pierre##br#
"These landmines are terrifying.#br#
I shake to think what would happen if they exploded..."#npc$$821$1#|
90528|Haha! This is my time to shine!|
90529|Let me have a look.|
90530|Did you find one? Let me have a crack at it!|
90531|The nerve of them installing landmines here! Just who do they think they are?|
90532|You know, everyone should be thanking me for not letting them just blow up in a landmine menagerie.|
90533|The jig is up!|
90534|Phew, it's done!|
90535|Everything's clear! Just call me Mr. Landmine!|
90536|That was a lot easier than I thought it would be.|
90537|Don't forget to grab a set of Taming Tools.|
90538|It looks like we'll first have to dispose of all these Sandworms!|
90539|You've tamed the otter! Perfect! Now we just need to clear out the landmines.|
90540|#&7$Reymon##br#
"If it wasn't for you, our soldiers would've literally walked right into their death.#br#
If I have anymore problems with landmines, I know who to call!"|
91001|#&7$Shane##br#
"I have foreseen a disaster that could raze the world... But I have also seen that it will be stopped. Could this prophecy be real?"#npc$$821$1#|
91002|The Hell's Crack has opened? (Important! Must read!)|
91003|#&7$Shane##br#
"Not yet..."#br##br#
#&53$Shane seems very sure of himself.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"However! It will soon, just you wait! No, don't leave! You're already here, anyway. Just hold on a minute, ok?"#br##br#
#&53$Even though you feel you have been tricked, Shane does seem really concerned. You decide to hear him out.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"Just wait a little bit longer! If my dream is correct, the Hell's Crack will appear very soon. Aah! I'm so nervous! Here, hold this for me so I don't drop it."#br##br#
#&53$Shane thrusts a strange device into your hands before you can say anything.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"Oh, uh, that thing is the mighty Lamp of Love, Courage, and Hope! Can you feel the love tonight? Can you feel the courage of a lion? This lamp is our only hope! I had to pull a lot of strings to get a powerful Archmage to take the time to put this together for me."#br##br#
#&53$You're beginning to doubt Shane's story even more after being handed this weird device...##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"Woah, hey! I know what you're thinking! This isn't a scam, alright?! I just know that it'll happen. I'm a fortune teller! Really!#br##br#
#&53$Beginning to get fed up with this guy, you return the lamp to Shane.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"Aw, come on! Please, just hold this! Hold it! Pleeeeease."#br##br#
#&53$While arguing, you hear a startlingly loud noise from far away.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"Ah! It's here! Here it is! It's here! We're really running out of time now! We have to go set this lamp up! Head on ahead of me and clear the monsters that will appear. Once it's safe, I'll be able to put the lamp in place. Hurry, we haven't got time!"#br##br#
#&53$Shane gesticulates wildly. You get the idea that you should hurry.##npc$$821$1#|
91004|Come here, savior from my dreams!|
91005|This lamp is even more powerful than it was in my dream.|
91006|The lamp in my dream was destroyed by the monsters in the end, so...|
91007|I will tell you when to set it.|
91008|Defeat the enemies first so that I can have the chance to get close enough to the crack and set the Lamp of Love, Courage, and Hope.|
91009|Be on alert! I can still hear the monsters' screams coming from deep within the crack.|
91010|Let's move!|
91011|Finally, I made it. The Teleport Gate was closed too fast.|
91012|Who are you?!|
91013|Are you the one who closed the Teleport Gate?|
91014|You have to work faster! The monsters are coming!|
91015|It'll all be over soon. I think there's only one left.|
91016|Let me seal it...|
91017|Wait! Waaait!|
91018|Aha! Boss, I'm going to catch the rat!|
91019|Where's the boss?|
91020|(He realized something was amiss after seeing Arkham's dead body.)|
91021|Seal it! Now! Finally, the end is near!|
91022|Thanks to you, I don't think they'll be able to open that crack again anytime soon.|
91023|#&7$Shane##br#
"Now go! After the crack opens, there will still be a brief period before the monsters start pouring in. So now's the time to seal it!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"You go on ahead! I'll tell you how to set the Lamp of Love, Courage, and Hope up."#br##br# 
#&53$Follow the light spot to find the Hell's Crack and Shane will tell you how to seal it.##npc$$821$1#|
91024|Why don't you set the lamp yourself?|
91025|#&7$Shane##br#
"There will be a lot of scary monsters coming out of that crack, and I can't even beat a Bunnyhop. Although, I did manage to steal a radish from one, once..."#br##br#
#&53$Shane shakes his head.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shane##br#
"Anyway, make sure you've defeated all the monsters before you try to set the lamp. We can't afford the risk of having one of them smash it. Wait until I tell you that the monsters have stopped coming, then you can set the lamp!"#npc$$821$1#|
91026|Let me see how to set it.|
91027|Hooray! It's harvest day!|
91028|You've travelled from so far away, you must be exhausted!|
91029|Sigh...my son still hasn't returned...|
91030|Welcome, welcome!|
91031|#&7$Daisy##br#
"Since I've chosen a different path and joined up with the 'Arcane Magic Pioneers,' I have to deal with all the dangers that go along with it. I much prefer doing research work to going on the frontline..."#br##br#
#&53$Daisy sighs.##npc$$821$1#|
91032|I heard someone's gone missing?|
91033|#&7$Daisy##br#
"Great! Thank you for coming."#br##br#
#&53$Daisy seems relieved at your arrival.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"Basil and I came to this Mine Pit in search of Arcane Magic Ores. If we did it in a normal way, simply collecting the ores one by one, it would take quite some time, but at least then it should be safe."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"But Basil decided to use explosives, hoping to shorten the time. Even if the Mine Pit collapsed and buried all the samples, I could live with that. But the explosives blasted a hole that unburdened a Bugs' Lair..."#br##br#
#&53$Daisy hesitates before continuing.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"I thought our operation would be over for now. That we'd just wait for someone to handle the bugs. But Basil didn't wait! He's gone into the bugs' lair all alone and hasn't returned!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"I don't know what to do about these bugs, and the rest of the Arcane Magic Pioneers aren't available. Do you think you can help me check on Basil? I have to know if he's even still alive!"#npc$$828$1#|
91034|No problem, I'll find him!|
91035|#&7$Daisy##br#
"Oh! Wait a minute. You seem really confident, so I'm going to guess you're pretty strong, am I right?#br##br#
#&53$It seems that Daisy wants to ask you something else.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"I know this is above and beyond what I originally asked you, but...do you think you could also eliminate as many of those bugs as you can? I'm really worried about what I saw in there..."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"Not too long ago I tried to enter the lair and look for Basil, and that's where I noticed a particular one that was a giant amongst them. I think this is their queen, and if she's not eliminated...she'll continue to spawn!"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"If we let her live, we'll soon be overrun with her brood and I fear they will exit the mines. Then we'll have an even bigger disaster on our hands..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Daisy##br#
"So, I think it may be the best move to make it a goal to kill the queen as soon as possible. She is a huge beast and looks really scary, but I know you can do it! I hope you can slay her, but if not...please, find Basil!"#npc$$822$1#|
91036|Are you here upon request? Please, help find Basil!|
91037|#&7$Basil##br#
"What a huge discovery! Who would've thought that we'd discover an ancient bugs' lair right here? Being an Arcane Magic Pioneer is turning out to be much more fun than a Keeper of the Ruins!"#npc$$824$1#|
91038|Please, go now! Daisy is so worried about you! (Start running out of the Bugs' Lair)|
91039|Aah! I better get going!|
91040|I was planning to collect some more ore while checking out this ancient lair|
91041|but these bugs' have terrifying claws, so I had to hide|
91042|and then I found that I was trapped!|
91043|I'm hearing something that I don't like the sound of...|
91044|What?!?!|
91045|Huh?!?!|
91046|It's been knocked out by those falling rocks. Let's get out of here!|
91047|Aaaaah!!|
91048|Let's get outta here - now!!|
91049|Um...have these bug eggs...grown larger?|
91050|These are too scary to just leave alone. How about you smash these bug eggs?|
91051|The queen is awake! Run...RUN!|
91052|She's after us, hurry! Run!|
91053|Basil! Are you alright?|
91054|Daisy! Run for it!|
91055|Huh?|
91056|Gah! What do we do now? If we stay still, we'll be devoured!|
91057|Finally...it's...over?|
91058|We should call the association and have someone study the bug eggs.|
91059|Haven't you seen enough bugs?!|
91060|There are so many requests, there's no more room to post any more!|
91061|#&7$Miriya##br#
"As the Village Chief, it is my duty to protect my people! I will not suffer anyone or anything to endanger my village. Not a chance!"#npc$$826$1#|
91062|The mollusks here seem strangely determined. Should I squash them all?|
91063|#&7$Miriya##br#
"This isn't working! The mollusks are breeding too fast in their nests for us to keep up with squashing one by one. There are too many!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Miriya##br#
"I think the fastest way will be for us to burn all the eggs in their nests. If we do that, that'll make their numbers much more manageable."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Miriya##br#
"To even get close to the eggs we'll have to make it past the adult mollusks. Not even fire scares them! I can't handle all of them by myself, so I'll need you by my side."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Miriya##br#
"Clear out the ones guarding the nests; when it's safe, I'm come in and start the fires. We'll have this mollusk situation zapped - well, toasted - in no time!"#npc$$821$1#|
91064|Let's squash some mollusks!|
91065|You go on ahead, I'll bring up the rear!|
91066|Ahahaha! Burn, you vile slugs, burn!|
91067|How dare you invade my home!|
91068|Ahahahahahaha!|
91069|Um...|
91070|Wow, what a huge egg! It'll burn quite nicely!|
91071|We have to move faster! The mollusks are starting to send reinforcements!|
91072|Make sure there are no more breeding females!|
91073|If there are any breeding females left, we'll have to start all over!|
91074|You need to take care of the next nest, too.|
91075|How lucky! Only larva in this nest, I'll take care of them swiftly!|
91076|Let's go to the next one...|
91077|The mollusks are coming down the passageway! Quickly, drive them off!|
91078|Watch out! Behind you! The mollusks!|
91079|Ok, onward!|
91080|I...I think I'll go later.|
91081|A particularly fat slug is blocking the way entirely, go squash it!|
91082|I think it's better for you to lead.|
91083|I'll just hide here a while; go find the next nest.|
91084|I'll catch up with you later.|
91085|Um...no eggs here...|
91086|Journey further in, these mollusks will meet their end!|
91087|Eh? Only larva here - no eggs!|
91088|We're too late! Seems like they're speeding up the breeding process somehow...|
91089|Follow me! We're running out of time!|
91090|There are no mollusks in this whole passageway...something must be wrong...|
91091|This is the biggest nest yet!|
91092|Look, more females! Stop them before they lay eggs!|
91093|So many mollusk eggs...I will burn them all!|
91094|Thank you for all your hard work. Now, let's talk about your reward...|
91095|I...I had no idea these mollusks could grow so large!|
91096|The troublemakers have been squashed thanks to you, %n%!|
91097|Now our village doesn't have to live in fear of these slimy creatures any longer.|
91098|They're finished! Hogan can take out ten of them on its own!|
91099|I heard that your village...|
91100|#&7$Miriya##br#
"No! We don't speak of that tragedy..."#br##br#
#&53$Miriya changes the subject.##npc$$828$1#

#&7$Miriya##br#
"This cave used to be a hideout for a band of pirates. It seems like they've only recently deserted it because of the influx of monsters. They've been reproducing so rapidly that they've even left the cave and come to our village to find food."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Miriya##br#
"This is too much! We just can't get rid of them! Our villagers have been bitten, our livestock is being eaten..."#br##br#
#&53$Miriya grows more furious as she speaks.##npc$$826$1#

#&7$Miriya##br#
"Talking about it is useless! Burn them all! Burn them! Burn, burn, burn!"#br##br#
#&53$You awkwardly pat Miriya on the shoulder in an attempt to calm her down...##npc$$825$1#|
91101|#&7$Edward##br#
"Discovering legendary ruins like these is something I've only dreamed of. Today, my dreams have come true!"#npc$$826$1#|
91102|Are you the one who posted this request?|
91103|#&7$Edward##br#
"Request? What request? I don't remember posting anything."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You explain to Edward what the request is about, yet you can tell by his reaction that he truly did not have a thing to do with it.##char$$821$0#

#&7$Edward##br#
"Hmm, I don't remember writing that, even though it is written in magic that I know of. I'm more interested in the location it provides of the Ruins...No one, except a few Archmages from the guild, should know how to find that place."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"It's possible that it was written by someone from the guild. But since there's no name... Maybe we should head deeper into the Ruins? It's possible we may discover him there!"#br##br#
#&53$Edward tries to contain his excitement of travelling deep into the Ruins.##npc$$821$1#|
91104|What makes these Ruins so important?|
91105|#&7$Edward##br#
"Generally, the regular populace has no idea of the presence of these Ruins. They used to serve as a base for our Guild many ages ago, however this base has long since been sealed up. Only the highest level Archmages can break the barrier and gain entry."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"Not long after a barrier is broken, a new one forms and the old entrance disappears entirely. This makes finding the entrance a difficult task and is often used as a final trial before becoming a high level Archmage."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"The reason these Ruins are so important to our guild is kind of abstract, you know? It's based on our long tradition and history our guild has with this place. That's really all there is to it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"Unfortunately, because we've been so secretive about these Ruins and how difficult they are to get into, people seem to think we're hiding treasure or ancient artifacts. For this reason treasure hunters keep poking around here - some even pretend to want to join our guild!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"These ruins are old, though, so we don't want random people trampling all around in search of nothing. That's also why we even try to limit our old guild members to just a handful who have permission to pass through the barrier."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"I've been a member of the Archmage Guild since I was very young. For us, these Ruins are a sacred place that most of us can only ever dream of entering. Now it's right in front of me!"#npc$$821$1#|
91106|Let's head out! (Commence Event)|
91107|Huh? Who are you? How did you find this place?|
91108|Let's go! We'll find the one who sent that request.|
91109|Look at this totemic pillar! It's covered in mystery and the history of our guild.|
91110|I can hardly imagine how spectacular it must be as we go deeper into the Ruins!|
91111|Hold on a moment! Do you hear a noise up ahead?|
91112|Monsters?! Here?! The elder never mentioned that this place would be so infested!|
91113|Don't worry, though! This is no problem for a high-level Archmage like me!|
91114|Behold the power of thunder!!!|
91115|Huh?! Why can't I use any magic?|
91116|Try again!|
91117|......|
91118|...No...Impossible! How can this be?!|
91119|Something is wrong here...|
91120|We must keep moving forward, no matter what.|
91121|If we encounter monsters, would you mind taking care of them for me?|
91122|I can give you a reward for your troubles.|
91123|Alright...Let's keep moving!|
91124|Let's check behind this stone door...|
91125|No! It's become a home for monsters!|
91126|We must get rid of all these monsters before they ruin our...Ruins!|
91127|Here it is! The legendary Altar of Light!|
91128|The light that emanates from this altar can give people temporary magic powers.|
91129|But...it doesn't seem to do anything for me. Could it be nothing but legend?|
91130|Ah, well, I'm happy just to see it!|
91131|I bet we'll see even more spectacular things through here...|
91132|Huh?! This just looks like a playground!|
91133|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You notice that the dirt seems to be concealing something...##npc$$1$1#|
91134|Dig it up! (Commence Event)|
91135|#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$You sift through the dirt and uncover a letter. The writing upon it is barely legible.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Uncovered Letter##br#
"If you have received my request and have just found this letter, it may be too late for me."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Uncovered Letter##br#
"I have been bitten quite savagely by a fearsome monster inside these Ruins. I have...request because...took all my effort to...hiding place."#br##br#
#&53$The letter is splattered with blood and some words are impossible to read.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Uncovered Letter##br#
"I'm afraid...can't make...longer...would like to ful...final wish...see...Ruins...my own eyes."#br##br#
#&53$The letter is splattered with blood and some words are impossible to read.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Uncovered Letter##br#
"If...willing,...hope you...defeat...beasts...I don't want...rot...blemish...sacred pla..."#br##br#
#&53$You still have trouble making out the words of the  blood splattered letter.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Uncovered Letter##br#
"Thank you...#br#
                                                                                                                        A...by."#br##br#
#&53$The signature is covered in dried blood.##npc$$1$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"Oh dear...what does that bloody letter say?"#br##br#
#&53$Edward catches up to you and takes a look at the letter.##M117013$Edward$823$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"I see. This has been written by the one who sent the request, isn't it? He uses the same magic writing I do. He...wanted to see these Ruins? Who could it be? The first letter of the name is A..."#M117013$Edward$821$1#

#&7$Edward##br#
"How peculiar...Well, we should move on. Maybe we'll come across something else. I'll stay close to you."#br##br#
#&53$Edward's intense expression is hard for you to read, but you suspect he's at least a bit worried.##M117013$Edward$821$1#|
91136|Looking at that...er...this...I...|
91137|#&7$Edward##br#
"Thank you, %n%. It has been an honor to have you accompany you through these sacred Ruins. I've finally fulfilled my dreams."#npc$$822$1#|
91138|Look at that! The impeccably formed arch of that vine-covered stone door...magnificent!|
91139|Look at all these intricate carvings.|
91140|Is it true? There are a lot of requests? (CCB Event)|
91141|I know that nobody really wants to do this, but I managed to find someone to help...|
91142|He is truly the best chief around. His planning and thinking are top-notch!|
91143|Yeah, right. How could they call on us high class people to do something so disgusting...|
91144|You could say that they called in only top-level warriors to handle top-level tasks!|
91145|Anyway, as the request says, go collect several Smelly Arachnid Eggs.|
91146|We'll try looking elsewhere for the Smelly Arachnid Silk.|
91147|Suddenly a swarm of Arachnids rushed forward and all the top-notch warriors used top-notch speed to run away!|
91148|I can't hide it from you...of all the First Village members, I'm the slowest at running...|
91149|Can I rely on you? Defeat the Smelly Arachnid Mother and collect some Smelly Arachnid Silk.|
91150|#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"Oof! One minute please, I need to put up this last request."#br##br#
#&53$After Mirabelle finishes posting all the requests, she turns to you and waves.##npc$$822$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"We've received so many requests lately that there's hardly any room left! There sure are a lot of people out there who need help. I hope that we'll attract a nice group of people to help solve everyone's problems!"#br##br#
#&53$Mirabelle looks at you expectantly.##npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"This message board system is a lot like CCB. Initially, it was only intended to be a service offered in Navea and Cactakara Forest, but we seem to be attracting requests from all around!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mirabelle##br#
"In the future, we'll expand the message board service to more distance cities, villages and forts. That way adventurers from all over will be able to take on a bunch of requests. Recently, however, the CCB has asked everyone to come help at our two main message boards."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
#&53$So that everyone can see more of the world, we're allowing all future prestigious quests to be seen early!#br#

"There are so many small villages in the world. Why is ours always the one that is chosen? No... I should say, why are there so many bad people? Is this world really headed for destruction?" #npc$$828$1#|
91152|#&7$Joshua##br#
"One more day and I'll be the hide-and-seek champion! Ah! You didn't see me, you didn't see me!" #npc$$823$1#|
91153|What are you doing here?|
91154|#&7$Joshua##br#
"Father says that if I last one more day without the Robots finding me, then I will be the hide-and-seek champion!"#br##br#
#&53$Joshua says some strange things with excitement.##npc$$824$1#

#&7$Joshua##br#
"The hide-and-seek competition! I don't really understand it, but when we came in here everyone quickly hid. Father said that if you're found, you need to help build the Champion Robot!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Joshua##br#
"The final Champion Robot is the first prize for this hide-and-seek competition! My dad snuck out and told me that the Champion Robot is almost done!" #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Joshua##br#
"Oh no! You should hide too! Otherwise, if you get caught, how can you share the Champion Robot with me?"#npc$$827$1#|
91155|Where did your father go?|
91156|#&7$Joshua##br#
"Father was discovered by the Dwarf Judge on the first day. However, he blocked their view so he didn't find me!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Joshua##br#
"Since then my father has been visiting occasionally to give me lunch and updates on the construction of the Champion Robot. I heard that it will be completed today! Seeing my father covered in sweat told me that it was true! My father is a very hard-working craftsman!" #npc$$824$1#|
91157|Speak! Where is No. 24601?!|
91158|Oh...|
91159|It hurts!!|
91160|I wouldn't say, even if I knew!|
91161|So brave! Clench those teeth!|
91162|Ahhh!!!|
91163|Food's ready! Help yourself, thanks!|
91164|Mas...Master...today's food...|
91165|Now what? You have a problem with three dishes and one soup?|
91166|Three dishes... this... doesn't count as a dish?|
91167|White rice, ketchup, soy sauce, mustard...|
91168|Did we forget... some food...|
91169|Ah? Over there, don't you have three dishes?|
91170|Oh...|
91171|Are you deaf? Answer me!|
91172|This... this isn't...|
91173|Are things too easy for you? Do you not have enough work?|
91174|These... These three dishes...|
91175|Right! Right! Are there three dishes?|
91176|Yes...|
91177|Move now! Don't stop!|
91178|Why did you stop? Are you lazy?|
91179|I... I really can't move...|
91180|Can't move? Then you're useless!|
91181|Someone come quick! Throw it in the furnace. Use it for fuel!|
91182|No... Master... no...|
91183|Thank you!|
91184|Hurry in, and save the others.|
91185|They are being worked to death!|
91186|I'm so hungry...|
91187|Hurry and stop those disgusting Dwarves. The Robot will be finished soon.|
91188|Thank you for saving us.|
91189|We were kidnapped, to help the Sinister Dwarf construct this Robot, so he can conquer the world.|
91190|Red Alert! Red Alert!|
91191|I can't work, so I'll be thrown into the furnace...|
91192|Quito worked for three days and three nights without a break. Then he...|
91193|Please help us defeat the Sinister Dwarf and, while you're at it, destroy that robot.|
91194|Did anyone see my husband?|
91195|...|
91196|He's already...|
91197|No!! Then... where... Where is my son?|
91198|They came together, but then I didn't see him...|
91199|No...No no no!|
91200|He has to be alive! He has to!|
91201|Joshua, Mother is here.|
91202|Quito! Are you here?!|
91203|Joshua!!|
91204|Mom!|
91205|Joshua! Are you okay?|
91206|Mom, I'm fine! Did I win?|
91207|Win? Win what?|
91208|The hide-and-seek competition!|
91209|Hide-and-seek? You mean... oh. Forget it.|
91210|Then your father...|
91211|Isn't Father making the robot?|
91212|Yes... It's all right. It's nothing. You're safe and that's all that matters.|
91213|Mother? Why are you crying?|
91214|Did we win?|
91215|Is the robot done?|
91216|Let's go home, okay?|
91217|Robot?|
91218|Where did you come from? Don't try to get me to confess!|
91219|Let me take care of this!|
91220|Rebels! There's rioting! Call the guards!|
91221|I'm so hungry. The food here has all spoiled.|
91222|Please go and rescue the others. We're not in any danger, just a bit hungry.|
91223|Are you ok?|
91224|Why does someone come and cause problems when we're 99% done!!|
91225|Every time! Every! Time!|
91226|Ah, it makes me so angry. No. 30! Arrest him!|
91227|Locking on target. Execution mode: Smash bones.|
91228|Oh no! Wha... What are you doing in here?!|
91229|People who don't understand romantic men can't come in here!|
91230|Take them out of here! Don't let them soil our sacred grounds!|
91231|Target locked. Execution mode: Throw out.|

92002|How dare you trespass here!|
92003|You will pay dearly for both your stupidity and your lack of respect!|
92004|Hmph! We'll see who's gonna pay!|
92005|You'll never succeed as long as I, Eddie - exorcist and demon hunter - am here!|
92006|Aah!|
92007|Hmph!|
92008|How dare you!|
92009|Huff...|
92010|......|
92011|You are a strong opponent indeed...you've forced me to use this skill!|
92012|Aha!!!|
92013|N-no way! How could you evade that attack with not even a scratch?!|
92014|Hmph! Stop trying to be tough! Watch me!|
92015|Stupid! I can crush you like a bug!|
92016|Enough!|
92017|I can't waste any more time on you. I'll just let them deal with you!|
92018|Hah! They ran away, no surprise there! They're clearly awed by my strength!|
92019|I won't let you get away! I'm Exorcist Eddie!|
92020|Kill...the invader!|
92021|Die!|
92022|Wait! I can feel the Crystal Shadows now...|
92023|Watch out!!!|
92024|Hah! Some puny Crystal Shadows think they can stop me?|
92025|So easy! Let's go!|
92026|Ah! Ambush!|
92027|Well...|
92028|Hmph! Didn't I tell you about my Club?|
92029|Careful now, there are still some Crystal Shadows abound!|
92030|Haha! See? Behold my strength!|
92031|Hee...|
92032|Huh? Is that the Rare Dark Flare Crystal Ore? I could restore my strength with this!|
92033|You wanna die?!|
92034|You've ignored my warnings! I'll grant your wish and send you back to the Gaia Cube!|
92035|Prepare to die, Callisto!|
92036|D-Despicable! A surprise attack!?
Aah, my knee!|
92037|So obviously a trap...how come I can't resist?!|
92038|I'll kill you all!|
92039|Your lives are forfeit!|
92040|How can this be?! How could I be defeated by someone like you...|
92041|Hang in there! Hang in there!|
92042|Get through this next wave of attackers! You can do it!|
92043|Stop the big guy!|
92044|Aah!|
92045|Uh-ah!|
92046|Well...|
92047|Ahhh...I must avenge them!|
92048|Hoo...hoo...|
92049|Ah!!! I...I finally...|
92050|Bros! Brothers! I've come to see you...|
92051|Cough...You fools! Today you die!|
92052|Brothers, the Captain will lead us. Fight with honor, all of you!|
92053|Haha! Like cattle to the slaughter, you will all perish together!|
92054|Captain, we are worthy of you, right?!...|
92055|Get away from here!!!|
92056|Ahh, what terrible power! I can't stand it!|
92057|I never would have thought an Envoy of Gaia would be here. You should have been killed by a Triceragon. That'd be a laugh!|
92058|If it's just you here, that means all those "loyal followers" have died...how sad.|
92059|It's a pity that they never discovered the true reason behind the Triceragon attack on the village. They were trying to protect me!|
92060|Haha, this is all so simple! All I have to do is extract the essence of these Dragon Eggs and I will surpass even the power of an Envoy of Gaia!|
92061|I don't have any idea why "normal" people even bother trying to stand up to me. They're all detestable -  even the Envoys are beneath me!|
92062|Heh, you can all die together then...|
92063|Everyone, charge! Yeaah!|
92064|Hold the last line of defense!|
92065|For Master Arlo!|
92066|For our brothers!|
92067|Protect Master Arlo!|
92068|Never give up! Never surrender!|
92069|Treasure! So much treasure!|
92070|Father, Father...|
92071|You're here, brave warrior!|
92072|Please, save Robin!|
92073|#&7$Lucy##br#
"I suppose things will make more sense with a bit of explanation. Robin is the Lord of this area; I am his Lady."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Lucy##br#
"We lived in this castle together, until the night a werewolf by the name of Sadlei attacked us."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lucy##br#
"Even with all of our guards, we were no match for Sadlei's terrifying power."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Lucy##br#
"He killed every guard and servant; it was terrible!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Lucy##br#
"Robin did his best to protect me; he managed to get me out of the castle, but he was too late in escaping himself. It's...it's all my fault... I'm begging you! Please save Robin!"#npc$$829$1#|
92074|Pffft, how did you get here?|
92075|#&7$Lucy##br#
"Right now the place is overrun by werewolves. If I go with you, I'll just hold you back. I'll meet up with you again once you've thinned them out."#npc$$821$1#|
92076|Whew, I finally made it! You're... different from the others, stronger....|
92077|Robin's ancestors have guarded this castle for centuries.|
92078|They would turn in their graves if they knew what happened to this castle. What should I do?|
92079|Please save us, I'm begging you!|
92080|I think Sadlei is up ahead.|
92081|Before that, please allow me to do the only thing I can do. Follow me.|
92082|Before you are the two sacred springs of our castle. On the left is the Spring of Hope. On the right is the Spring of Eternity.|
92083|Only the righteous can feel their power.|
92084|You killed so many of my underlings. You will pay for this!|
92085|You actually fell for it! I changed your loved one into a creature like me! Hahahah!|
92086|Oooooow!|
92087|Rooooaaaaarrrrr!!|
92088|Oh, an intruder? Someone wishes to die tonight.|
92089|Die!|
92090|I never thought... This day would come....|
92091|Robin! You're awake!|
92092|I feel dizzy... What happened? Who are you?|
92093|I'm Lucy... How could you forget?|
92094|...|
92095|O-oh, yes... Lucy... I remember now! Thank the gods, you're safe!|
92096|Don't scare me like that again!|
92097|You protected me...|
92098|...but next time, we'll escape together, OK?|
92099|I was really worried about you, you hear me?!|
92100|Alright, Lucy, I promise.|
92101|Thank you for finding me. I'm lucky to have you.|
92102|#&7$Lucy##br#
"The water from the Spring of Hope and the Spring of Eternity is sacred. Bathing in it fills your body with its power."#npc$$821$1#|
92103|#&7$Robin##br#
"I feel like I've just stepped from a dream. Rebuilding this castle will take some work, but I'm happy Lucy is here with me."#br##br#
#&53$Robin smiles warmly.##npc$$821$1#|
92104|#&7$Lucy##br#
"I'm so glad there was an antidote! I can't even fathom what would happen if Robin couldn't wake up. But, enough of that, time to get this place in order again!"#br##br#
#&53$Lucy grins happily.##npc$$822$1#|
92105|That despicable Sadlei has poisoned Robin.|
92106|What terrible luck, the antidote must be on him! You must defeat him!|
92107|Sadlei, you disgusting cretin! Today you will finally meet your match!|
92108|Oh? Little beauty, you dare come back?|
92109|I did come back, this time for your life!|
92110|Hmm, such a cute little jest.|
92111|You've killed too many of my men! You will pay for this.|
92112|O-oh, another werewolf! This is frightening....|
92113|Please hurry....|
92114|MY BROTHERS! How DARE you!!|
92115|You will pay with your lives; I won't let you leave here alive!|
92116|Thank you...Werewolves still terrify me.|
92117|You have proven yourself with your strength and generosity.|
92118|The spring water will replenish your strength. Go quickly!|
92119|I-I think there's something moving in the back.|
92120|I think it's Sadlei, the one that dragged Robin away.|
92121|Why...why does he look so strange?|
92122|No matter, just please defeat it!|
92123|W-what?! It couldn't be... Robin?! But how?|
92124|Men to the left, women to the right. Those without proper identification, stand off to the side.|
92125|Quiet, quiet please! Dabo can only see so many people a day! Line up and wait your turn quietly!|
92126|Let me in!|
92127|Dabo has been blessed with the gift of the gods. It's my parents' wish to use my savings to join.|
92128|Please, I need to see Dabo!|
92129|I broke my finger by accident yesterday. If not for the fact that Dabo has already blessed me before, I would have broken my entire arm!|
92130|Man, what are those people inside doing? They need to hurry it up! I need to see Dabo!|
92131|Some say that Dabo is the reincarnation of a god! I can't wait to see him!|
92132|I was in a terrible accident, but I managed to walk away without a scratch! I know it was because of the blessing I got from Dabo!|
92133|This time, this time I'll definitely see Dabo!|
92134|I'm sorry I forgot to pay my membership fee last month! It won't happen again, just please-please let me in!|
92135|Eh?! Not you again! There's no way Dabo will let you in!|
92136|You should have stayed at home! 10 million memberships won't let you in!|
92137|I-I-I have a right to be here, just like everyone else! As long as I pay for the ID card, everything will be fine.|
92138|Maybe you can get in with the membership, but I doubt Dabo will give you the blessing!|
92139|Just go home already, Dabo won't waste his time on people like you.|
92140|I...I....|
92141|Well, if you pay an extra ten-thousand gold for an advanced-level ID, you'll have better chances of seeing him.|
92142|Take me, for example. When I purchased an advanced-level membership, I got to see Dabo right away.|
92143|That's it, then! Dabo must only see advanced-level members!|
92144|Someone like you definitely needs to spend the extra ten thousand gold.|
92145|It took me this long just to save up one-thousand gold. How am I supposed to get ten-thousand?|
92146|Does that mean there is no way my sick younger sister can be blessed?|
92147|You! What are you doing there, sneaking around like that?! Are you new?|
92148|Ah, I-I am, this... This is my first time here....|
92149|Heh, more fresh meat! Move over here and show me your ID.|
92150|My cultist ID...? I...well....|
92151|Well? Hand it over!|
92152|N-No!|
92153|You can't get in unless you do as I say! Now, let me see it!|
92154|Get someone down here to search this shrimp!|
92155|Ah! No!|
92156|Looks like he doesn't have ID on him after all.|
92157|You dare show your face here without ID? Looks like fresh meat is now dead meat!|
92158|Shoot him!|
92159|Yes, sir!|
92160|Ahhhhhh!|
92161|And who are you? Never seen your face here before.|
92162|Hmph, this imposter is probably the friend of the last one that tried to sneak in here. Search this pipsqueak as well!|
92163|Hmm, looks like the photo on this ID doesn't match the holder.|
92164|It's cheating filth like you that makes this world such a horrible place!|
92165|W-what?! N-no....|
92166|Looks like it's time to get some backup to deal with all of this riffraff!|
92167|Heh, anyone that crosses me crosses the entire cult!|
92168|Beat 'em up!|
92169|His enemy is our enemy!|
92170|Dabo's enemy is our enemy!|
92171|Now you've gone and pissed me off! Somebody put an end to this!|
92172|Alright, this ends here and now!|
92173|Blast it, where are the security guards? They better not be napping....|
92174|I am in the middle of performing an absolution for everyone. How dare you disturb me!|
92175|My followers!|
92176|Give him a lesson he will never forget!|
92177|Aye!|
92178|Dabo is performing a sacred ritual for all of his followers;  how dare you barge in here to disturb him!|
92179|If you do not believe in Dabo, you are no better than trash!|
92180|#&7$Sylvia##br#
"Oh, you're the one that answered my request, yes? Jenecka is inside. Please find her for me!"#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Sylvia##br#
"Just be careful... Dabo is supposedly performing a secret rite; it could be dangerous."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sylvia##br#
"Here's your Cultist ID; I paid good money for it, so don't lose it."#npc$$825$1#|
92181|Receive your Cultist ID.|
92182|#&7$Sylvia##br#
"You didn't lose your ID already, did you?! I paid a fortune for it, so keep it safe!"#npc$$825$1#|
92183|#&7$Sylvia##br#
"You'll need this ID when you enter the venue."#npc$$822$1#|
92184|#&7$Sylvia##br#
"Oh no, look at what she did! This is all my fault! If I would have paid better attention to her, this never would have happened."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sylvia##br#
"I need to take better care of Jenecka so that something like this won't happen again."#npc$$821$1#|
92185|Dabo is being quite generous today! With only a Cultist ID and ten-thousand gold, he will grant you passage to Aura Kingdom!|
92186|If you believe in Dabo, you will ascend to Aura Kingdom. If not, you'll be stuck with the trash!|
92187|Hmm? Why the trash?|
92188|This is why you're such a blockhead! Those that can't ascend to the heavens are nothing but trash.|
92189|Dump 'em in the trash!|
92190|Such filth! The trash!|
92191|Someone like you dares to beat me?! Knock it off, it hurts!|
92192|Oh snap, I've been beaten! Run for your life!|
92193|Run... For your own good...!|
92194|Dabo!|
92195|Blast it, we're doomed!! Aaaaaaaaah!|
92196|Jenecka! There you are!|
92197|Mom! We're doomed!|
92198|What are you talking about?!|
92199|Dabo is beaten! He's wounded! Now we're all doomed!|
92200|Jenecka, he is nothing but a fraud and a cheat!|
92201|No, he's not! We'll be condemned for all eternity!|
92202|Mom, go home! The apocalypse is happening!|
92203|Maybe if I return home, she'll finally calm down....|
92204|We swear our allegiance to Dabo.|
92205|Dabo, help me!|
92206|Whoever disturbed the ritual shall pay!|
92207|Ah...blast it! How can he...Uhh...|
92208|How dare you steal someone else's ID?! I cannot let you through!|
92209|I am...the best....|
92210|Dabo is right!|
92211|I'll kick your butt!|
92212|Hermano has made it clear that not even a single ant shall cross this line!|
92213|How annoying, why'd you go and do that!?!|
92214|This one here is dead meat! Dabo has divine power!|
92215|You better not be starting any trouble!|
92216|Dabo... Help me....|
92217|Dabo will redeem me!|
92218|Oh please, Dabo's gonna teach you a lesson!|
92219|Lord Dabo...I am so sorry....|
92220|You can't go in there, you'll anger Dabo.|
92221|This...can't be true... Dabo doesn't have any divine power!|
92222|Liar!|
92223|Give us back our money!|
92224|Can I borrow some money for my Cultist ID?|
92225|Can I borrow someone's Cultist ID?|
92226|Lend me your Cultist ID, OK? I just need it for a day....|
92227|#&7$Ticket Taker##br#
"Hey, you! You need a Cultist ID to get in!"#npc$$825$1#|
92228|Show him the Cultist ID.|
92229|#&7$Ticket Taker##br#
"Hmm... I see. OK, I'm gonna let you through. Keep it quiet, there are a lot of people still waiting to get in."#npc$$825$1#|
92230|#&7$Ticket Taker##br#
"Can you not read the signs?! You don't have a Cultist ID! Get out of here!"#npc$$827$1#|
93001|Ah, it's you! Legendary hero!|
93002|Brother, is this person the Envoy of Gaia?|
93003|Hmph! Looks weak if you ask me!|
93004|You're so awesome! The rumors are true!|
93005|Those pirates didn't stand a chance with you against them!|
93006|You are awesome!|
93007|You're so strong!|
93008|I never thought I'd have a hero like you on my side!|
93009|Let's get outta here in case more pirates arrive.|
93010|Is it true that you knocked out seven pirates with one punch?|
93011|What? This is real? Awesome!|
93012|Wait! There are more arriving!|
93013|That's a blue axe! It's the Abyss Axe Leader!|
93014|Those two are Giant Jordan's sidekicks!|
93015|Don't fear! We have the Helonian Hero on our side!|
93016|That's right! Show us your strength!|
93017|You can do it! Send them running!|
93018|Awesome! You're even stronger than the rumors claim!|
93019|They are the strongest among the Abyss Axe Leader's crew!|
93020|That's right. They've killed more people than I can count...|
93021|They're here. Perhaps the Abyss Axe Leader has also returned.|
93022|We should get out of here!|
93023|The Abyss Axe Leader is huge! He's always carrying his gigantic axe.|
93024|I heard that he can cut a ship in half with one swing of his axe!|
93025|What?! That's scary!|
93026|It was he who robbed the Chamber of Commerce's merchandise.|
93027|No wonder the Chamber of Commerce has been robbed, no amount of guards could handle this!|
93028|It shows just how strong the Abyssal Axe Leader is!|
93029|Huh? I hear violent fighting up front!|
93030|Who's that? The Chamber of Commerce's guard and...|
93031|That huge body...|
93032|That giant axe...|
93033|That's the legendary Abyssal Axe Leader - Giant Jordan!|
93034|Ouch! That hurts...|
93035|Ah! I'm gonna die...|
93036|Aaaah! Real monsters!|
93037|Don't be afraid!|
93038|We've got a legendary hero on our side! Don't you forget it!|
93039|You can do it!|
93040|Come on, hero!|
93041|Impressive! Even Giant Jordan's legendary axe is no match for you!|
93042|I always knew you were a true hero!|
93043|I bet you can knock out 77 pirates with one punch!|
93044|Bravo!|
93045|I never thought I'd witness the defeat of the Abyssal Axe Leader!|
93046|You're here! I've been waiting for quite a while.|
93047|Balibali! Amahong! (Spell)|
93048|Achoo!|
93049|Doop-de-doo!|
93050|La la...|
93051|Doo dah doo dah...|
93052|Let's go!|
93053|There's a human?!|
93054|Don't eat Piggy! I wanna eat human!|
93055|Piggy, follow me!|
93056|Look! It's Moe!|
93057|It seems that he's fainted.|
93058|You can just leave it to us.|
93059|Isn't it Rehia?|
93060|Stinky Rehia...|
93061|There's no water around...let's wash her with saliva!|
93062|Spit, spit spit!|
93063|No! The smell is even worse now!|
93064|That was close! Almost got smooshed by the fat guy...|
93065|Cole?! Are you alright?|
93066|Elder! Everyone! You are all safe now!|
93067|Heehee, we had this great hero's help, so of course we're safe!|
93068|We've made all the Trolls' wild boars switch to our side!|
93069|Alright! Now it's our turn to attack!|
93070|Huh? Isn't that Piggy and Radish?|
93071|Piggy? Why are you back here?|
93072|Does Piggy look bigger to you?|
93073|Because of the huge radish you've eaten?|
93074|I'm hungry. Can I eat now?|
93075|BEHOLD!! Flame Piggy Formation!!|
93076|Let's go!|
93077|Aah...Aah...Aaah.......|
93078|So powerful!|
93079|We're finished...|
93080|Ouch!|
93081|Ah...Ah...Ah...|
93082|Anyone who disturbs this match will die!|
93083|I'm gonna kill you all!|
93084|I'll eat everyone!|
93085|You're stronger than the Troll!|
93086|Go rescue the princess!|
93087|It's alright...it has turned red, but it's not done yet...|
93088|You think so? It seems about 70% done...|
93089|Princess, the hero is here to save you!|
93090|You should say thank you to the kind Envoy!|
93091|Hmph! Why should I?!|
93092|I was just enjoying my sauna, and you disturbed me!|
93093|Sauna, what sauna?...You were almost cooked!|
93094|No way!|
93095|Way!|
93096|Princess...|
93097|Ohh...I can't hold them off anymore! The pirates are too strong!|
93098|I've used up all my energy...|
93099|You must be the one the Elders found to help!|
93100|Great! The princess is still inside. We'll leave it up to you!|
93101|Ah...my magic is completely drained...|
93102|I...I need to rest...|
93103|Princess, are you okay?!|
93104|Don't call me "princess"! I'm a warrior!|
93105|Hah! How could a warrior be so weak?|
93106|Who are you calling weak?!|
93107|Settle down, settle down...|
93108|Warrior, hah! More like "Weakling," am I right?|
93109|Why you! Watch this! Lightning Rod!|
93110|Ow! Hey! You hurt me!|
93111|Take that! Here it comes again - Lightning Rod!|
93112|Ahhhhhhh...|
93113|I'm sooo angryyyy! SUPER LIGHTNING ROD!|
93114|Whoa....|
93115|Oh, you're finally here! I've been waiting for quite a while.|
93116|Follow me, I'll show you our current situation.|
93117|These villagers only woke up a short time ago.|
93118|Save us! Save our family!|
93119|What do I do?! Mother won't wake up...|
93120|Father! Father!|
93121|Baby, wake up...I'm right beside you...please...|
93122|Their family members are in a deep sleep; they don't want to leave their side.|
93123|You're our last hope to save their family members.|
93124|Follow me, the Princess's people are just up ahead.|
93125|You see it, right? The Princess's people are having terrible nightmares...|
93126|It looks like they'll never wake up.|
93127|With my magic, I can prevent things from getting worse...|
93128|I have no way to draw them out of the dream world, however.|
93129|The best I can do is teleport you into their world of dreams.|
93130|Enter their dreams and free them from the nightmare that binds them. Then they should be able to wake up and return to reality.|
93131|I will bury you in stinking mud!|
93132|Behold, the power of stinking mud!|
93133|Get away from me! I don't want your stinking mud!|
93134|Somebody save me, aaaaah!|
93135|Who are you? I feel like I know you somehow...|
93136|No matter - thank you for saving me!|
93137|Don't even think about running! You wouldn't dare betray the Princess!|
93138|Ahh...I don't...you can't force love!|
93139|Hah! I will take you back and you WILL marry the Princess!|
93140|Help! I don't want to get married!|
93141|Run! The soldiers are catching up!|
93142|How can they just keep coming?!|
93143|I can't take much more of this...I'm going to collapse!|
93144|Where are you trying to run to?!|
93145|Whew! We lost them. Thank you!|
93146|Wait a second...who are you? How did you get here?|
93147|Eeek! So many bugs!  Get away get away get awaaaay!|
93148|Aaah! They're going to crawl on meee!|
93149|Am I getting rusty?|
93150|In the future I want to become a Master Bugslayer just like you!|
93151|Thank you for saving me!|
93152|Almost...I almost defeated the King of Dream Eaters!|
93153|Ugh...my head...I think I dreamt of some horrid monstrosity.|
93154|Strange...I can still smell something awful...|
93155|Hmm...the Crab Princess was...kinda cute.|
93156|I feel like bugs are crawling all over me! Eeee!|
93157|I never expected that you'd defeat the King of Dream Eaters!|
93158|You are truly someone we can all count on.|
93159|Thanks to you, my family is saved!|
93160|You're the hero of our village!|
93161|Hooray! We don't have to fear our nightmares now!|
93162|Thank you for saving our village.|
93163|I don't know what we would have done without you!|
93164|That was terrifying! The Fallen Sprites are really vicious!|
93165|Help...I'm rotting!|
93166|Ohhhh! I'm so scared!!!|
93167|Ahhh! I really hate these flowers!|
93168|My gear is made of iron! You wouldn't dare eat me!|
93169|Those Fallen Sprites are really vicious. Some others have been captured - go save them!|
93170|Ohh! If it was just another stupid Rotten Flowertrap I wouldn't be scared!|
93171|Good thing I thought to wear iron armor! These things hate iron.|
93172|This can't be the end...Princess...ughh...|
93173|Good! I knew you'd show up.|
93174|So, you're the one the Elders recommended?|
93175|Argh! Look what you did! You made another mess!|
93176|It was an accident!|
93177|You lie! It was on purpose!|
93178|Okay, okay! Stop fighting, there are other people here, you know.|
93179|Princess! Apologize to your people!|
93180|That's right, you did make a huge mess after all.|
93181|No! I didn't do it! It's not my faaaault!|
94001|Mwahaha! Watson, did you ever think you would end up like this one day?!|
94002|If Mayin hadn't injured me so badly...I wouldn't have any trouble dealing with a scumbag like you!|
94003|Oh look, you brought help. How cute!|
94004|I will deal with you later!|
94005|This...This light! Aaaaah!|
94006|Argh, human! You've discovered my true identity!|
94007|I can never let you live now!|
94008|Mo-Monsters!|
94009|What have you done with Garner?|
94010|Give my friend back!|
94011|Dash it all! Garner must've been taken by the demon!|
94012|Brave hero, please save Garner!|
94013|Grandpa, grandma, we have a guest!|
94014|Who are you? Do I know you?|
94015|Hey, be nice to our guest!|
94016|Hmph! Who says they're a guest?!|
94017|If you don't have something important to say, get lost! Stop wasting our time!|
94018|Sorry, she hasn't been well lately, so she's a bit grumpy.|
94019|Hmph!|
94020|Didn't I tell you not to speak to us?! Scram!|
94021|Grandma, what's wrong? Does your stomach hurt?|
94022|Where do you come from, youngster?|
94023|My-my wife has become a demon!|
94024|Heh heh, come inside the house!|
94025|Grandma's turned into a demon!|
94026|Young one, forgive my rudeness from earlier...|
94027|I don't know how to live without my wife...|
94028|Please! Bring her back to me!|
94029|Haha, what a fool! Fell for it so easily!|
94030|I will bring you back to my master, Mayin!|
94031|Staring at the elderly is very impolite!|
94032|Welcome, Sir Watson!|
94033|Thanks for taking care of the demons in the valley; you've bought me a bit of time!|
94034|Now let's fight together!|
94035|What! I didn't expect there to be so many demons!|
94036|Looks like all the residents here have been abducted by Mayin...|
94037|If we don't act fast, there's no telling what horrible things will happen!|
94038|Let's go! I sense an evil spirit in the northern valley!|
94039|Mayin and his captives must be there!|
94040|I can feel the demon presence now...It's very close!|
94041|Watch out!|
94042|There! I see the villagers who were taken! Let's go!|
94043|The atmosphere here is strange...|
94044|How odd...There should be guards on patrol...|
94045|Well, nevermind, let's keep moving...|
94046|You're finally here, Watson.|
94047|Don't tell me you were injured earlier.|
94048|Don't lie to me!|
94049|Nobody can stand up to my might. Looks like you're ready to die!|
94050|Watson...You're really getting old...|
94051|The only reason you're alive is...luck!|
94052|To see you live such a miserable life...|
94053|How about I do you a favor and send you directly to Pandemonium!|
94054|Hyaah! Come on out boys, let's "treat" our guests!|
94055|Curses! It's a trap!|
94056|It's too late for you now! Haha!|
94057|You've wasted enough of my time. Both of you, just die!|
94058|Feel the wrath of my Chains of Frost!|
94059|Succumb to the forces of gravity! High Voltage Electromagnetism!|
94060|Elaine! Jules! How...How did you get here...|
94061|Don't worry, we'll fill you in later!|
94062|I'll leave the boss to you guys!|
94063|Impudent human! How dare you do this to my people!|
94064|I'll kill you. All of you!|
94065|I didn't expect us to meet under such circumstances...|
94066|Huh? Am I reminding you of someone else?|
94067|Somebody, help me...|
94068|Old lady meat doesn't taste so good...|
94069|Stop chatting. Just release me...|
94070|Watch and learn!|
94071|Ouch!|
94072|Who is it?! Who's talking?!|
94073|Enough with the drama! Show yourself!|
94074|Ugh! I can't believe I let myself be cornered by some old people...|
94075|I'll show you what I'm truly capable of...|
94076|Soul Reaving Black Thunder!|
94077|Haha, Mayin truly underestimated us.|
94078|Remember! Next time it's not gonna be so easy!|
94079|You...You guys could never defeat Mayin!|
94080|Hehehehahaha!|
94081|Hmph.|
94082|Hehe.|
94083|It's time for you to taste defeat!|
94084|Get outta my way!|
94085|Hmph! I didn't think Mayin could pull that off. He got away!|
94086|Are you the one Mirabelle recommended for this duty? I've been waiting for you for quite a while!|
94087|Let's get started! I'll tell you all about the park's problems as we head there.|
94088|Oh! I almost forgot to introduce myself.|
94089|I'm Doctor Crow. I oversee all the exhibitions in Brawner Park.|
94090|As you can see, most of our park projects are almost complete.|
94091|What troubles me most is that a several of our projects are currently plagued with problems.|
94092|We've had so many issues lately; some outside help would be much appreciated.|
94093|Here's the first problem we'd like to tackle.|
94094|Doctor Crow.|
94095|Our guest is here to help us solve our problems.|
94096|Explain all the details to our guest here.|
94097|Great! I can hardly believe you've already found an Iron Armordillo Egg!|
94098|Wow, another one already! Keep at it!!|
94099|Doctor Crow was right about you! Now we have all three Iron Armordillo Eggs!|
94100|At last, our problem is solved!|
94101|Thanks!|
94102|Haha! This is great! Mirabelle really knew what she was doing when she sent you to us!|
94103|Once all these issues are taken care of, you'll be properly rewarded!|
94104|Let's head over to the next area, shall we?|
94105|Be wary! The Iron Armordillo mothers get very aggressive around this time of year!|
94106|Why don't you take a break and try again later?|
94107|Haha, our park design is pretty nice, don't you think?|
94108|Look at all these exotic creatures!|
94109|Here is our park's logistics center.|
94110|Recently our animal fodder has been pilfered by thieves. It's an outrage!|
94111|Reggie is the manager of that department; you can ask him for details.|
94112|Leave it to me, Doctor Crow! I won't let you down.|
94113|I'm counting on you two! I'll be in the next area when you're done.|
94114|How many Thieving Rexes did you catch? Hurry and put them in the pool!|
94115|Not bad! You caught a Thieving Rex!|
94116|This looks promising! If you keep it up, you'll reach your quota in no time! Keep up the good work!|
94117|Alright, five of them! That'll put a stop to a lot of their thievery!|
94118|Thanks to you, I'll be able to get rid of those crafty Thieving Rexes.|
94119|Doctor Crow is waiting in the next area.|
94120|If those annoying little guys return, I'll certainly ask for you by name next time!|
94121|Hahaha!|
94122|I'm here! We've been waiting a long time.|
94123|I heard that you've already solved Reggie's thief problem.|
94124|You've done us a huge favor!|
94125|Our next problem is...|
94126|Oh! Let us explain it, Doctor Crow.|
94127|Well, alright, if you insist. I'll go see Principal Hamon then; I hear an urgent problem has arisen.|
94128|Take care, Doc!|
94129|Haha, Kurska can hardly wait to get started!|
94130|So, let's begin!|
94131|Your first lesson is to learn how to get enough drinking water. You can't do anything if you're dehydrated.|
94132|Drinking Water can usually be obtained from clear streams, freshly collected rainwater, or other clean water sources you come across.|
94133|And in dry areas, such as a desert, you can obtain water from certain plants called succulents.|
94134|Keep in mind, however, that some colorful plants are poisonous!|
94135|Take care not to eat them by mistake!|
94136|Well done! Let's continue with our next lesson.|
94137|After you've found a good source of clean water, you will then need to find food.|
94138|Unfortunately, you can't simply buy food from the store while you're out in the field,|
94139|so you'll need to be skilled in hunting in order to get food for yourself.|
94140|When selecting your prey, single out the weakest first. That'll be a prime target.|
94141|After all, the odds are ever in your favor if your target is weak, you know?|
94142|If you think you've fully understood all my lessons, you'll be able to survive in the wild.|
94143|Don't forget, Nature is full of surprises,|
94144|so no matter how careful you are, you might still get hurt...|
94145|When that happens, besides avoiding tough enemies,|
94146|you can also use medicinal herbs to accelerate recovery if you are injured.|
94147|Having a good rest is also necessary to fast recuperation.|
94148|You've passed all courses with flying colors! Well done!|
94149|Hrwaarararrrr!|
94150|Kurska seems to be having a good time too! Thank you so much!|
94151|I've heard that Principal Hamon and Doctor crow are looking for you.|
94152|You can visit us anytime! Kurska will be so happy to see you again!|
94153|Now, imagine that you are in the wild. You feel tired, hungry and thirsty.|
94154|Haha! Right on time! There's something you need to see!|
94155|I'm Hamon, the Principal of Brawner Park.|
94156|Doctor Crow said you've been working on solving our park's problems. Thank you so much!|
94157|Now we will begin the Giant Mountain Dragon summoning ceremony!|
94158|The Giant Mountain Dragon is a huge, ancient creature that many tourists come to see.|
94159|Would you like to witness a historic moment with us?|
94160|Alright then, let me show you! Pay close attention!|
94161|Hyah!|
94162|Haha, it worked! This big heavy thing is the Giant Mountain Dragon!|
94163|Oh, ah...|
94164|Aaaaah...|
94165|No...not good. We've totally underestimated its strength...|
94166|No need to worry! We're experts in Paleontology!|
94167|Before we get everything ready, try to stall it - buy us some time!|
94168|Excellent timing! We're all ready to start!|
94169|Please enjoy the heroic display of our Musclemen!|
94170|Hah! Nobody should dare call our principal old! He took care of that big fella with ease!|
94171|No, no, no! It was all due to the help of this brave adventurer!|
94172|Thanks to you, a lot of our problems have been dealt with today. We're so happy to have had your help!|
94173|I wouldn't have applied to work if I'd known...|
94174|Life is full of tough decisions...|
94175|Welcome to Brawner Park! Amazing curiosities await you within!|
94176|The opening ceremony is about to start! Everyone is preparing to do their absolute best!|
94177|This kid...is really...annoying...|
94178|If only we could just get rid of these guys...|
94179|Did you find the Egg? Quick, hand it over!|
94180|You got two so far. I had no idea you'd be able to catch them so easily!|
94181|Hah! That's three Thieving Rexes! You're very nearly done, now!|
94182|Four Thieving Rexes! One more to go!|
94183|The preparations are going swimmingly! Just give us a little more time and we'll be all set!|
94184|Our preparations will soon be complete! Just a little more work!|
94185|#&7$Mysterious Boy##br#
"Are you here to look for the Ring for me? I am so happy! I was on the verge of giving up looking for the Ring."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Mysterious Boy##br#
"Let me tell you a secret, I have heard that this place is haunted! There is a Miner's Ghost wandering around here all the time... Then it keeps mumbling...so horrifying!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mysterious Boy##br#
"Last time when I came here with my friend, we were here for an adventure, It turned out that before we saw the Miner's Ghost, we were scared by apparitions here so we ran out of there! What was even worse is that I did not notice that I had lost my Ring until I went home..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Mysterious Boy##br#
"That is the only thing my late grandmother left me... So I would like to come back there to look for the Ring, but my friend refused to come back here with me again..."#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Mysterious Boy##br#
"Will you... keep me company?"#npc$$1$1#|
94186|If this place is haunted, we'd better be careful. Stay behind me and follow me closely!|
94187|I am counting on you.|
94188|I am the Miner's Ghost! Work, work!|
94189|Wait, what have I dug up?|
94190|An Emerald Ring, excellent!|
94191|The Ring must be inside! Can you open it up for me?|
94192|I finally got it! It was worth every effort!|
94193|Then, I will be on my way!
I will also take the rest of the treasure in the treasure box with me. Farewell!|
94194|Humph! It was only a minor mistake!|
94195|Ah... So scary...|
94196|I believe I do not need to introduce myself to you.
Obviously, I am the Legendary Thief!|
94197|Wherever there is Secret Treasure, I will be there!|
94198|Hey! Are you listening to me?|
94199|#&7$Cassidy##br#
"It was so scary..."#npch+25$$828$1#|
94200|This ring is...taking over me...!|
94201|This ring... Is mine... Forever....|
94202|With... you... forever.|
94203|Of course the target is now the ring! Supposedly, it can control the wearer's inner magic.|
94204|I was confused. How could I open the treasure chest?  |
94205|Then I thought of a way! I dressed up as a young boy and...|
94206|...|
94207|I should introduce myself.|
94208|I am unknown in the world of thieves. Came up with the name myself!|
94209|Hehe, the less people know about this, the better.|
94210|Wait a sec - will the mine collapse?|
94211|It's got to be here.|
94212|Where is that stupid ring?|
94213|Could it be in this box?
Just open it up and see.|
94214|Wow, this treasure chest sure is sealed tight!|
94215|I've no strength left...
|
94216|I've... no idea what... what you're saying.|
94217|Then offer... your soul!|
94218|Is that you? Give me the ring....|
94219|Oh! There you are!|
94220|What a shame...|
94221|Why are you always one step behind?|
94222|Play with it and have some fun!|
94223|Oh dear, there are some real troublemakers here...|
94224|Bored...|
94225|Help me kill some time?|
94226|Oh! I sweated some!|
94227|Anyway, you guys are here to stop me from unlocking the seal, right?|
94228|Hmph! Catch me if you can.|
94229|How about...|
94230|The seal will soon be unlocked.|
94231|Hee hee...|
94232|You dare set foot on my territory? You're not prepared!|
94233|Let the competition begin!|
94234|Leave this sucker to me!|
94235|Go, go, go!|
94236|Brother, don't die here!|
94237|Attack! There isn't much time left...  |
94238|It's you guys... Why am I not surprised? Never mind, here is where your journey ends!|
94239|You can't go forward from here.|
94240|Stop the ritual!|
94241|We've got this. You go stop the ritual, now!|
94242|What a shame!|
94243|You almost pulled it off! Hahaha!|
94244|Damn! Were we too late?|
94245|Fast, slow, average... who cares?|
94246|Just wait and you'll see something amazing.|
94247|Whatever comes out, I'll punch it into submission.|
94248|I am filled with power!|
94249|And you will be my first sacrifice!|
94250|Weaklings! You don't even deserve my time!|
94251|Come back again when you've become more worthy opponents! Hahaha!|
94252|Stop!|
94253|Brother! Calm down!|
94254|What! Why can't I get in? How could this be?|
94255|Hmm... you can't get in there either...  |
94256|I was too careless. Everything is my fault. Brother, please... please don't let anything happen to you...  |
94257|What is this thing? I can't break it.|
94258|It must be some sort of Magic Barrier...|
94259|Maybe we could use a conductor to bring down the Magic Barrier?|
94260|We'll take care of everything here. You need to activate the Guiding Device!|
94261|There must be a charger nearby that will allow us to recharge the Guiding Device.|
94262|It's fully charged! Quick! Remove the barrier!|
94263|Almost there. Quickly! We must press on!|
94264|We have to stop them!|
94265|An attack is under way. We've received orders to seal off this area.|
94266|Envoy of Gaia, I'll leave this barrier to you!|
94267|Try to interrupt the ritual and you're dead!|
94268|Quickly! We must put a stop to the ritual before it's too late!|
94269|All right, everyone's here! Launch the attack!|
94270|Don't go running ahead all pell-mell. There may be an ambush waiting.|
94271|Catch me if you can!|
94272|Ha! You're mine now!|
94273|You are nothing but puny ants to me!|
94274|What are you doing?|
94275|Enjoy the last few seconds of your life... before I squash you like a bug!|
94276|No, Brother! It's a trap! Don't be fooled!|
94277|How can this be?  |
94278|No!  |
94279|How can this be?|
94280|No! Ahhhhhh! S-stop!!|
94281|I don't... want to die...  |
94282|Want to give it a try?|
94283|The barrier is gone. Let's get inside and see just what they're up to!|

95004|Dr. Wright: These poor robots are so full of hatred...it really makes me sad.|
95005|Dr. Wright: You know, these Robots were originally produced to make the world a better place.|
95006|Dr. Wright: Dr Willie and I once worked together, studying artificial intelligence. Our hope was that robots could improve the quality of peoples' lives.|
95007|Dr. Wright: After one went out of control, everything spiraled downward. These robots now call themselves 'Mavericks' and care only for killing...|
95008|Dr. Wright: Go with Rocco and try your best to put a stop to these robots. Maybe then you'll be able to understand why these robots exist.|

"Brilliant! It seems that Rockman acquired backup! The Mavericks are simply too strong for us; if they manage to break through, the outcome will be disastrous."#M112012$$827$1#

#&7$Dr. Wright##br#
"To resist the Mavericks, you'll need Rockman's assistance. That iron piece you have is an energy core; please insert it into the slot of the armor next to me."#M112012$$826$1#|
95010|#&7$Dr. Wright##br#
"This Armor can generate ice defenses. It can release icy air cold enough to freeze other robots in their tracks. If we can simply understand this armor more, we have a better chance at stopping the Mavericks."#M112012$$826$1#|

95013|Obtain the Strength of <Ferrous Maverick> Vladimir.|
95014|Are you interested in knowing the story behind the Mavericks? It begins a long time ago....|
95015|Dr. Willie and I used to work together to create the first robot that could think logically like a human. That robot was Rockman.|
95016|Rockman proved to be a perfect assistant to our research on artificial intelligence.|
95017|Before long, Dr. Willie and I began to treat him like our own child. We seemed to have forgotten that he was only an android made from iron scraps.|
95018|This world, however, was not prepared to receive robots that were so much like humans.|
95019|Shortly after we publicized our research, people who could not understand our work began to attack us.|
95020|They accused the very existence of artificial intelligence of being blasphemous to the rules of creation, so they naturally overlooked the obvious benefits affiliated to this research.|
95021|When their fear rose to a zenith, mobs launched raids on our factory...|
95022|A raging fire destroyed everything we had dedicated our lives to; I was killed in that fire.|
95023|Rockman obeyed my instructions to download my remaining consciousness on a computer. Rockman also rescued Dr. Willie from the fire.|
95024|I can only imagine the rage that has been burning within Dr. Willie's heart since then. That anger must be what turned him into a scientist who does not use our research for humanitarian concerns...|
95025|The robots that were not destroyed into the fire have been converted into killing machines, including Rockman. Dr. Willie named them the Mavericks.|
95026|Rockman... Even after losing speak and logical thinking still functions.|
95027|Completely on his own, he searched for his original instructions, which were extracted from my remaining consciousness. By doing this, he protected himself from Dr. Willie's influence.|
95028|I'm sure that Rockman is alive, that he has a soul. That is what made him break free of the limitations wrought on him by metal and programming to follow his own will. He was fighting to stop Dr. Willie.|
95029|I don't know how long I can stay with him, but I'll do my best to assist him with the time I have left.|
95030|Now, please, brave hero... Continue to fight with him until you extinguish Dr. Willie's vengeance!|
95031|This place enhances an armor's power. Want to give it a try?|

96001|Ho ho, there are so many cute little pumpkins that keep me company, I am so happy!|
96002|I must work harder to bring back more little pumpkins.|
96003|Nelly! Nelly! Some strange pumpkins snuck their way in here!|
96004|What? Where are they? Where are they?|
96005|Oh, no! They're gone...|
96006|Lylin, you are such a naughty girl! Don't play pranks on us, telling lies.|
96007|But I saw some really strange pumpkins...|
96008|Nelly! Nelly! Where are you going? I want to come with you!|
96009|Buliser, be a good boy. Nelly is not going out to have fun. She needs to welcome the new little pumpkins!|
96010|Then, when are you going to play with me?|
96011|Very soon! By the time I come back, there will be more little pumpkins to play with us!|
96012|That's great! Buliser likes to have more little pumpkins to come!|
96013|Oh...Wow!|
96014|Sequoba, what's wrong? Why are you making so much noise?|
96015|Ah! I didn't take Nelly by surprise! It's no fun!|
96016|Sequoba, you shall not do that... If you scare other little pumpkins, you will get a spanking!|
96017|I... I will not do that anymore...|
96018|It really is Nelly! Great! Let's do it, according to plan!|
96019|Please, would you investigate this? We have to get those missing pumpkins back!|
96020|Ho ho, you are the new little pumpkin, aren't you? I have been expecting you for a long time!|
96021|What? You don't talk? It is all right... Just come to Nelly.|
96022|Is everyone ready? We need to cut a mouth for this new little pumpkin, so that he can soon start talking and join our non-stop conversation!|
96023|Ha ha, the new little pumpkin looks very naughty. The person who catches this new pumpkin first will receive a special reward!|
96024|No problem, Lady Nelly!|
96025|Aya!|
96026|That's no problem at all! Once, I managed to catch three little pumpkins at once!|
96027|Lady Nelly! Please marry me!|
96028|Wait a second, how are we supposed to catch it? Using our mouths?|
96029|I don't know what to do, but it sure looks like fun!|
96030|Go! You're about to catch that little pumpkin!|
96031|Haha, it was that close! You almost caught it!|
96032|Aya! What a pity! We should try harder!|
96033|What an energetic little pumpkin!|
96034|Wow, am I going to get him this time? Ah! He escaped!|
96035|Ha ha ha, everyone has fun!|
96036|It's, it's human? How can this be?|

"Such a dreadful place... I wonder what's wrong with me, that I would come here in the first place..."#br##br#
"Really... pumpkins can be grown if someone needs them. Why make such a fuss?"#br##br#

96039|#&7$Simpson##br#
"Shhh... I can't let the owner of this house find out I'm here."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"You're here about the missing pumpkins, right? They just up and flew away for no good reason. Yep, flying pumpkins. I followed them here, only to discover a creepy lady called Nelly. She's the one behind all this trouble!"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"Here, take this. I stumbled across this potion by accident. It'll turn you into a pumpkin for a while."#br##br#
"If you look like a pumpkin, you can follow Nelly without getting caught! I need you to tail her and find out what she's up to."#npc$$821$1#|
96040|Leave it to me! (Open the Instance)|
96041|Hmph! Just bring it on! Even without my scythe, I can still break you!|
96042|What's your relation to Nelly?|
96043|#&7$Simpson##br#
"Ho ho... I have no relation to her whatsoever, I was just given the order to apprehend her. As for why, you should know. Otherwise, why would you have taken this request in the first place?"#br##br#
#&53$Simpson smiles in an obscure and mysterious way.##M102040$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"Don't think too much, adventurer. I am just a simple pumpkin farmer, trying to track down his missing pumpkins. That's all you need to know."#br##br#
#&53$Simpson raises his hand to stop further conversation on this topic.##M102040$$822$1#|
96044|Why did Nelly have to bring pumpkins with her?|
96045|#&7$Simpson##br#
"I have no idea..."#br##br#
#&53$Simpson thinks, scratching his head.##M102040$$828$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"Let me put it this way: Pumpkin Farmers always treat the immature pumpkins as if they were their children. Farmers take good care of them and give them what they need to grow. Maybe Nelly really believes these pumpkins are her own children."#br##br#
#&53$Simpson nods.##M102040$$821$1#

#&7$Simpson##br#
"That's right, it must be that... But no matter how lonely a person is, it is not permitted to give life to pumpkins..."#br##br#
#&53$Simpson starts muttering to himself.##M102040$$828$1#|

"According to Yeshe the Elder, at the end of this road, there is a mechanism which can turn off the Flame. I happened to bring a Thruster with me, which can help people fly up in the air. We can get someone to put it on and be flown over to turn off the Flame."#npcs70h+85$$825$1#

#&7$Moe##br#
"However, since this Thruster is not working very well, I will have to control it remotely. Others here are not so good at flying."#npc$$821$1#

"Thus, after much discussion, we all feel that you should undertake this task. We believe that you can find a way to complete this Quest."#npc$$821$1#|

96077|#&7$Moe##br#
"The 'Floating' button on the Thruster lets you take off immediately,
@and continuously fly through the air." #br#

*Floating lasts only 30 seconds. Move quickly before the effect ends. #npcs70h+85$$825$1#|

96080|Put on the Thruster and get ready to fly!|
96081|Thank you so much, what would we do without you?|
96082|Without you, we would not make it through here.|
96083|Shall we move on?|

96105|Of course I do! It wasn't this cold in that winter.|
96106|Do you still remember what you said then?|
96107|I said that... Uh... I said that...|
96108|What is "that?"|
96109|What is what? I'm confused now... Let's go inside. It's freezing out here! My brain is going to freeze!|
96110|Wow! Andy is awesome!|
96111|Hmmm!|
96112|I'd like to learn too. Please teach me...|
96113|No problem! First, you need to...|

96115|Okay...|
96116|Hey! Wait! Aren't you guys... Feh!|
96117|Andy! Have you seen Mom's three wallets? I can't find them anywhere.|
96118|I took them. There was no money in them, anyway.|
96119|Augh! Andy! If you don't hand over the wallets right now, I will hurt you!|
96120|Alright! You've really got a temper...|
96121|Aah! If things go on like this, there ain't gonna be enough food! Let's go to the mountain tomorrow and try our luck.|
96122|Sigh... May spring come soon! If it stays this cold, we won't even be able to catch hares.|
96123|Hey! How could you cook and eat all the meat, when it was supposed to last the whole week!?|
96124|I'm hungry! I've been eating nothing but potatoes for a week. I can't stand it anymore!|
96125|What you did is really not going to make our lives easy this winter...|
96126|Trust me! I'll come up with something. Look, the meat is ready. Do you want some?|
96127|Of course I do! Humph!|
96128|Don't be mad... What's done is done, let's just enjoy our meat tonight!|
96129|The snow is so cold!|
96130|Indeed!|

96144|Achoo!... Geez... It's really c-cold. I g-g-guess I'll call it a d-day.|

96152|See... see you around...|
96153|Sigh... Only one box left. How are we  gonna survive this winter?...|
96154|Let's go to the mountain tomorrow and try our luck...|
96155|Hubby! How much food do we have left?|
96156|I think we have enough, don't worry!|
96157|Didn't you tell me that you went hunting? Why did you come back empty-handed?|
96158|I... Erh... Well... I'm not feeling well, so I just came back...|
96159|Then how would you explain all the missing food?|
96160|Well... I... I don't know...|
96161|Don't even bother! What's that, on the side of your mouth?|
96162|What? I thought I'd wiped it clean...|
96163|Wiped clean! You'll be punished today!|
96164|Please... Please forgive me...|
96165|May people in the Small Winter Village always find peace and tranquility,|
96166|And may everything be fine in the future.|
96167|Alright! Let's call it a day. Priest Nicolas will be glad to know you guys have kept the faith.|
96168|Where's the Priest?|
96169|Well... I don't actually know. But he said he would bring a surprise to the village, so let's look forward to it.|
96170|Hee hee. I wish I could see him again, real soon.|
96171|Yeah, me too. See you tomorrow.|
96172|Ok, see you.|
96173|I've collected all the things that are needed! (You need to collect 5 Wood Planks, 5 ropes, and 5 Red Juice Fruits in the Small Winter Village)|
96174|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"Hmm... It doesn't seem that you have brought all the things. In order to repair the sleigh, I still need 5 Wood Planks, 5 ropes, and 5 Red Juice Fruits. They can all be found inside the Small Winter Village. So, I'm gonna have to ask you to try it again."#M316012$Nicolas$827$1#|
96175|I'm ready. Let's get started.|
96176|I wanna get back to the entrance. Let's go back together.|
96177|#&7$Nicolas##br#
"We haven't even started yet, and you want to go back?"#br##br#

96196|Your vehicle is really awful.|
96197|What did you say? Try saying that to my face! My armor will make you regret it!|
96198|Any idiot could tell my vehicle is way better!|
96199|No! My armor!|
96200|Oh don't be so upset. We'll make you a new one!|
96201|Pilot mode reset.|
96202|Thank you! Thank you so much!|
96203|Ha! I knew it! I knew someone would come and save me!|
96204|This is so weird. Why am I here?|
97001|There is no sign of Redd all along the way, what shall we do?|
97002|Our leader has been waiting in the Grand Hall for a long time, go and offer your Tribute to our leader now!|
97003|Hurry up, our leader has been waiting forever!|
97004|Another twerp from a poor village. Tribute or dowry?|
97005|Sonia represents her village to offer valuable treasure with items such as gold and pearls|
97006|Well, that's that. Adjutant, lead them to the Treasure Vault so they can add their stuff in there!|
97007|Aye.|
97008|I'm going back for a little nap. Once you've got everything taken care of, report back to me.|
97009|The treasure stays, and you also stay. We could use your labor for our hideout.|
97010|My dearest, what are you doing here?|
97011|Oh great, another foolish villager has been fooled to come here.|
97012|Run for your life!|
97013|Sonia, you idiot! Do you think we can really get out of this mess?|
97014|Come on, we gotta break out of here!|
97015|I don't care how difficult it is, I will find you.|
97016|Blast it, most of the guards are at the Hall; we can't escape this way.|
97017|What are we going to do? Will we die here?|
97018|Where do you think you are going? Get back to your post and work!|
97019|#&7$Sonia##br#
"We're almost at the castle hall, but there's still no sign of Redd. I won't give up on him, though."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sonia##br#
"I'm just an ordinary peasant woman, but here I am walking into a place full of bandits! It's all I can do to keep my knees from shaking."#npc$$828$1#|
97020|Don't be afraid. Follow me; I'll protect you.|
97021|#&7$Sonia##br#
"I know we'll find Redd. I know it!"#npc$$826$1#|
97022|#&7$Sonia##br#
"These bandits are just too cruel. Not only must we give them our valuables, but they also lock us away as slaves!"#npc$$826$1#|
97023|We need to head back to the village; everyone is worried about you.|
97024|I had to take everything of value as an offering in order to get into this place to look for you.|
97025|We're now penniless; we'll have to work that much harder just to make ends meet.|
97026|My dearest, we can always earn our money back. As long as you're by my side, I have nothing to fear.|
97027|Let's go while the way's still clear. I have so much to tell you when we get home.|
97028|This isn't clean at all! There's so much dust on these weapons.|
97029|Please, have mercy! Let me take a brief rest.|
97030|Everything's cleaned and polished. May I have some food now? I've missed two meals.|
97031|I don't know, you're too slow. Besides, all we have is rice left.|
97032|I'll eat anything! I'm so hungry....|
97033|What?! Another one has escaped?! Vermin must learn to accept their place!|
97034|Thank you so very much. I found this crate; please accept it as my gratitude to your help.|
97035|Hey, new guy! Get back to work, or you'll regret it!|
97036|I-I was going to take these crystal pieces to the village, but I think you should have them. I hope you find them helpful.|
97037|What? You wanna die? How dare you defy me!|
97038|Teach him a lesson.|
97039|You're in our domain now! You take orders from us!|
97040|Lock this vermin away - no food for two days!|
97041|You will pay for this.|
97042|If you won't work, you'll rot in jail!|
97043|I've been standing so long; my feet are killing me! Please, can I take a quick break?|
97044|No, I dare not. I heard that someone sneaked into the kitchen to take a nap. That person had to work for three days straight with no food or rest. It exhausts me just thinking about it.|
97045|Walk when I tell you to! Stop looking around! Pick up the pace!|
97046|Look at those fools and their ratty clothing. No way they have anything valuable.|
97047|Hey, beat it, I'm trying to nap here. If someone finds me like this because of you, I'm dead!|
97048|After being trapped here for so long, I finally get a chance to return home!|
97049|My family hasn't heard from me in so long; they must be worried sick.|
97050|Go away before someone catches me! I do not want to be locked away again.|
97051|This is not the place where you can just come and go.|
97052|What's all the commotion out there?|
97053|Some vermin got away, go after them now!|
97054|Round them all up, then throw them in jail! No one escapes!|
97055|Nobody escapes from here, including you.|
97056|With me keeping watch, you won't be able to move an inch without me noticing.|
97057|The only way you leave here is as a corpse.|
97058|Oh no, the bandit leader and his goons are catching up to us!|
97059|Blast it, we were so close to escape!|
97060|I've already painted three. How come you haven't finished one yet?|
97061|Don't bother me. I'm thinking about the lines on the Totem.|
97062|Thinking? You're just being lazy! Maybe I'll go complain to Tony...|
97063|Don't... I'll paint. Lend me one for reference.|
97064|We Easter Bunnies take great pride in our artistic skills. You're plagiarizing my work!|
97065|I must tell Tony about this.|
97066|Fine. I'll paint by myself. Spoilsport! Hmph!|
97067|Hello! We're here. We've waited a long time for you. Quick, come here. We're getting ready to go!|

I was ready to rush right in!"#npcs70h+85$$821$1#

#&7$Zinnia##br#
"The Elders say there may be hidden dangers in the mountains, #br#
so they insisted on waiting for you before setting out. #br#
I told them that with me here, there was nothing to worry about." #br#
Zinnia scowls.#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Zinnia##br#
"Anyway, forget it. Remember to stay close#br#
and call out if there's any danger.#br#
Then a brave warrior will run to protect you!" #npc$$821$1#|

97070|Do you need an ice pack?|

"In the eastern lands, there's a holiday called the Dragon Boat Festival.#br#
Over the course of the festival, the villagers make lots of incredibly delicious food.#br#
The highlight of the festival is a dish called 'Dragon Dumplings.'" 
#npcs70h+85$$821$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"I'm not sure how the princess got wind of this,#br#
but suddenly all she could talk about was Dragon Dumplings.#br#
That's why we've come here." 
#npc$$821$1#|
97073|Cole, you could use a rest...|
97074|So, what are Dragon Dumplings?|
97075|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"To be honest, I've lived most of my life #br#
having never tried a Dragon Dumpling. #br#
From what I've read, however..." 
#npcs70h+85$$821$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"Dragon Dumplings are encased in Bamboo Leaves.#br#
Many delicious ingredients of precisely the right amounts#br#
are enclosed in the leaf. Then the whole things is steamed to bring out the delicious flavor." 
#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Yeshe##br#
"I hope it really is delicious. #br#
To tell you the truth, I'm pretty excited to try one myself. Haha!" #npc$$825$1#|
97076|Don't cry. Let me show you some transformation magic.|
97077|Okay, listen to what she says. Don't scare everyone.|
97078|What did you come here to find?|
97079|#&7$Yeshe##br#
"I don't know where the Princess heard this information, #br#
but she says there is an old woman here who came from the mainland in the East. #br#
Supposedly she knows how to make the best Dragon Dumplings! So here we are."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
97080|#&7$Cole##br#
"I really want to eat some Dragon Dumplings, but I'm feeling so lazy..."#npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
97081|#&7$Rehia##br#
"Hmm, I suppose it's okay to eat the food of mortals once in a while..."#npcs70h+85$$825$1#|
97082|#&7$Moe ##br#
"I hope the Dragon Dumplings aren't too hot...#br#
I need to make sure I take care of my body at all times.#br#
Otherwise, I won't be able to fit into my suit!"#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
97083|Step aside, everyone: I am a warrior. I can hear the call of the Dragon Dumplings...|
97084|Ahaha - walk slower! The Dragon Dumplings aren't going anywhere.|
97085|Hurry and catch up to the Princess. I'm worried that all the Dragon Dumplings will end up in her stomach.|
97086|Lately, it feels like this iron armor has shrunk... It's a little tight now.|
97087|Everyone, move faster. Hurry and catch up to the Princess!|
97088|Protect the Princess!|
97089|Release that girl!|
97090|Princess... Are you all right?|
97091|Heh, don't make such a fuss. It was just a few Wild Boars. How could they hurt me?|
97092|Princess, what happened? Were you injured?|
97093|No, I just wanted to say that I'm hungry. I was just thinking I might want to eat some roast boar first.|
97094|Nevermind. I want Dragon Dumplings. Let's go! Brave warriors must bravely march forward!|
97095|Princess, wait for us.|
97096|Sob, sob...|
97097|What's wrong? Tell me what happened. This brave warrior will help you.|
97098|Hmph. Princess, you're bullying us!|
97099|#&7$Little Girl##br#
"Grandma said she was just going out for a walk, #br#
but she should have been back by now. #br#

and there are no other adults in the house."

#&7$Little Girl##br#
"I came here to find my grandma, #br#
but I soon realized there were a lot of Wild Boars here.#br#
They're really scary."#npc$$829$1#|
97100|Grandma went deep into the mountains. Please, help...|
97101|Where did these Wild Boars come from?|
97102|#&7$Little Girl##br#
"I don't know where these Wild Boars came from. #br#
I've never seen them here before. What if... what if Grandma #br#
got eaten by those boars! Sniff, sniff..."
#npc$$829$1#|
97103|Have you heard of Dragon Dumplings?|
97104|#&7$Little Girl##br#
"I've eaten them before! My grandma makes them every Dragon Boat Festival.#br#
Help me find my grandma and you'll have all the Dragon Dumplings you want."
#npc$$829$1#|
97105|Leave it to us. (Begin Event)|
97106|Let's go! If we save the girl's grandmother, we'll have our fill of Dragon Dumplings. It's two birds with one stone...|
97107|Wild Boars are very dangerous. Princess, please, not so fast...|
97108|Why don't we sit awhile and rest first?|
97109|Grandma, if you can hear us, say something...|
97110|We've reached the end. Why haven't we found anyone?|
97111|Come out. We have you surrounded!|
97112|Put your hands in the air and walk out slowly...|
97113|If you keep talking like that you'll scare them into not coming out...|
97114|We know it's you. Let the old woman go!|
97115|Protect the Princess!|
97116|What did you eat to get so big?!|
97117|This is gonna be tough!|
97118|Holy Grass God! Is this a dream?|
97119|Look! I found her!|
97120|Hurrah, you found the Dragon Dumplings!|
97121|Whew... it's a good thing you're here. I've been hiding for so long. That thing has been roaming around here for some time.|
97122|Grandma! Ahh! I was so worried about you.|
97123|I'm sorry I made you worry... I'm fine now.|
97124|Grandma, I asked these people to come help find you. I promised we'd make them some Dragon Dumplings to show our gratitude.|
97125|No problem. I'll make as many as you want. I'm grateful for your help!|
97126|#&7$Zinnia##br#
"Excellent! At last, we can eat some Dragon Dumplings."#npcs70h+85$$824$1#|

"Come find me if the Dragon Dumplings need to be heated up or frozen."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
97130|#&7$Grandma ##br#
"As a token of my gratitude, #br#
I'd like to invite you to my house.#br#
I'll make Dragon Dumplings for everyone."
#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
97131|How do you make Dragon Dumplings?|
97132|#&7$Grandma ##br#
"It's actually very easy to make Dragon Dumplings.#br#
First, shape the bamboo leaf into a bowl. Then, add the sticky rice. #br#
Next, add just the right amount of filling." 
#npcs70h+85$$821$1#

#&7$Grandma ##br#
"Then you just fold the bamboo leaf into a triangle shape #br#
and wrap the stuffing up tightly. Lastly, you tie it together with a string, #br#
steam it in a pot, and it's ready to eat!" 
#npc$$821$1#|
97133|Look, it's easy!|
97134|#&7$Little Girl##br#
"Thank you, everyone. I don't know what I would've done if it wasn't for each and every one of you."#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
97135|#&7$Moe ##br#
"There isn't a low-cal version, is there?"#npcs70h+85$$821$1#|
97136|Fantastic!|
97137|I've gotta say... I've lived here for a long time, but I've NEVER seen so many Wild Boars roaming around. It's the darnedest thing!|
97138|I heard from my husband that a bunch of those nasty Wild Boars have been popping up around here lately. I'm not sure if they're dangerous or not...|
97139|I'm gonna catch me a Wild Boar! One would be enough, don't you think? I've just gotta think of how to do it...|

Someone is hiding behind the corner of the house. #br#

"No matter how well you hide, I will always find you!"#npcs70h+85$$1012$1#|

98001|All right, all right, wait for me!|
98002|Didn't you say that there's lots of treasure in the Tower of Sky?|
98003|That's right! Where is the treasure?|
98004|Look! There seems to be something in the middle!|
98005|Mirage?|
98006|How can this be! This isn't the desert!|
98007|These shadows look somehow weird...|
98008|The robot becomes real!|
98009|For the treasure! Kill!|
98010|Kill! Ahhhhh!|
98011|Sharlyn, what are you doing? Why do you keep twisting around?|
98012|I... I think...|
98013|Whatever you're thinking, say it out loud! Sometimes I wonder about you.|
98014|I will tell uncle you bully me!|
98015|You keep whining to my father, that's why I have no respect for you.|
98016|Sob!|
98017|All right, all right... I am afraid of you. What are you trying to say?|
98018|I want to go to the bathroom...|
98019|How should I get you a bathroom? Why don't you go behind that tree?|
98020|That tree is transparent! People will see me!|
98021|There is nothing about you people will want to see anyway...|
98022|Bitter! Sharlyn! I want to follow my uncle...|
98023|Stop, stop! Let me take you around to find a bathroom, Ok?|
98024|Hurry! I can't hold it anymore!|
98025|Okay, we're going now! If I'd known how annoying it would be to bring you along, I wouldn't have brought you at all.|
98026|This is Tavana's lair? How disgusting, with spiders all over.|
98027|As long as I get rid of Tavana, I can stay with Margaret...no, Aveline, again!|
98028|Tavana! Come out and meet your end!|
98029|Who is this guy? Some type of...stone person?|
98030|My dear fellow, I never had anything to do with the Brimstone Walkers. Why are you shouting in front of my house?|
98031|Brimstone Walker or not, I don't care! I am here to avenge Margaret!|
98032|I have had a Marfenn, a Mary, a Garet, a Liter... But I never had any Margaret. Are you sure?|
98033|All of the Gogen family members, save for Margaret, died by your hands, and you don't have the guts to admit it?|
98034|Gogen... Oh! That's the human family with a link to dragons!|
98035|Their taste of their blood is quite vile, but it does help to increase my strength!|
98036|I didn't expect to miss out on one family member. Ah, eating too much lowers your guard.|
98037|You man-eating monster! I will kill you for Margaret and the Gogen Family!|
98038|Ha ha... Impudent fool!|
98039|Agh! Despicable!|
98040|You have the gall to call ME monster? Are you not a monster in the eyes of the humans?|
98041|One monster seeking revenge on another, for the sake of the ones who already distrust you...how cute!|
98042|The time for talk is over! It's time to fight!|
98043|I do not eat the creatures of the Brimstone Walker Tribe. I think I'll use you as a lovely decoration for my home!|
98044|No!|
98045|Heath! Heath!|
98046|Oh dear, so many customers today! What, pray tell, are you supposed to be?|
98047|Tavana!|
98048|In the name of the Gogen family and for Heath, I will slay you!|
98049|Ah, the Gogen again? How many of them have I missed?|
98050|...Ancient Draconian words? Perhaps I will take this a bit more seriously!|
98051|Heh... Draconian incantations are just as powerful as ever.|
98052|Nonetheless, miserable wretch, it looks like you won't last long! Why, you may as well just give up, and let me eat you!|
98053|Hah... never!!|
98054|Mmm, I prefer more energetic foods such as you...|
98055|Heath?|
98056|Eh? Still alive?|
98057|Margaret! Pull yourself together... You can make it through this! Please!|
98058|Still, you come? You throw your life away so carelessly!|
98059|Ah? No! This can't be...|
98060|Heh... Wrong move...|
98061|Oh, Heeaaath! Come out, come out, wherever you are! Otherwise, I might just get a bit...MAD!|
98062|I didn't think this stone man would be brave enough to use such a forbidden move. There's no way he could live through it...Cough...|
98063|Heath... Is he really...dead?|
98064|I'm...hurt, yes, but there's...there's just no way he could survive that attack!|
98065|...|
98066|Aghh! I've fallen right into your hands....|
98067|...Stone? Heath! Is that you, Heath?|
98068|Heath! Heath! Come out! Show yourself...|
98069|I promise I'm not mad, Heath. Please come out...|
98070|Heath...you...you asked me to live. Well, here I am...I'm alive...|
98071|But in a world without you, what's the point...|
98072|Aveline! Aveline!|
98073|That familiar voice...is it...?|
98074|It's me! Heath!|
98075|Heath! You...Why are you...?|
98076|I'm no longer human. Now I am can be forever by your side.|
98077|Heath...|
98078|I don't want my family to come looking for me like this. From now on, I shall be known as Vachnam. I am Heath no longer!|
98079|...Vachnam?|
98080|Vachnam, Guardian of Aveline. Has a good ring to it, don't you think? Haha!|
98081|Get out of here.|
98082|Eh? Did my dear Aveline truly ask me to leave? Hahaha, no. I must have misheard!|
98083|Vachnam! I want you to leave! Get out of here!|
98084|A...Aveline?|
98085|Are you serious? You really want me to go?|
98086|Leave now! I said leave!!|
98087|Ha, leave? Where can I go, but by your side?|
98088|You...you're just not strong enough to ever defeat Tavana. You'll only get in my way if you stay!|
98089|How can you be so sure? We'll never know until I fight Tavana!|
98090|Long ago, I pledged to stand by your side no matter what your outer appearance is. I will always be here for you!|
98091|I will stand by your side, Aveline... Always!|
98092|You still think you have to protect me, when you can't beat me in a fight? I think you'd better go.|
98093|No! I won't go! If you want me to leave, you'll have to defeat me first!|
98094|You... miserable... scoundrel!|
98095|You've lost. By your own word, now you must leave.|
98096|NO! No, I... I can still stand and fight!|
98097|...I'm sorry, Vachnam. No matter how many times you try, you will never defeat me...|
98098|No! No! I will - I will triumph!|
98099|Vachnam!...Why can't you see? What will it take for me to convince you to leave this place?|
98100|Aveline...You truly do not want to me stay...?|
98101|...Yes. I... You must leave me, Vachnam...|
98102|But first...you must tell me the truth of the fall of the Gogen family. I must know what happened and why you look like this now... Only then will I leave you, as you wish.|
98103|Okay, I'll tell you.|
98104|Sob...|
98105|Sharlyn? What's wrong? Why are you crying?|
98106|Ohhh...I just feel so sorry for them...|
98107|Them? Who do you mean?|
98108|...Wait! Are you talking about those phantoms?|
98109|Yeah... Poor Aveline and Vachnam, I feel so sorry for them...Sigh...|
98110|Oh, well, they're just phantoms. You shouldn't pay them any mind.|
98111|Ugh, Egusi, you'll never understand! All you care for in this world is fighting and killing.|
98112|Better to be like me! Who would want to be like you, bawling like an itty bitty baby!|
98113|Egusi! I will tell Uncle what you said!|
98114|Oh, yeah? I guess you really have nothing better to do than complain to others...|
98115|Whew!|
98116|Who?|
98117|Ahh, excuse me! Pardon me! You two are...Sharlyn and Egusi, yes? My name is Cucumber! Delighted to make your acquaintance.|
98118|Hohoho...Today's harvest will be great! I'm so excited!|
98119|This... This is just some kind of practical joke right?|
98120|Dad...Mom...get up, stop scaring me...|
98121|Come on, stop pretending! ...Get up...get up! GET UUUP!|
98122|This can't be real! Not real!...No...Noooooooooooo!|
98123|You... When you've all left me, what will I do... Whatever will I do?|
98124|...Revenge... I will have my revenge! I will destroy that half human, half spider monster!|
98125|I must somehow gain the strength to take on such a horrid beast...Ah! That's right, the Forbidden Ground!|
98126|Ever since my uncle went insane after entering the Forbidden Ground, my grandfather has forbidden anyone from entering. There must be some sort of secret that place holds!|
98127|This is a forbidden area? I don't see anything special here...|
98128|Who goes there? Who speaks?|
98129|I...I don't care who it is! It doesn't matter! I just need to get stronger - fast!|
98130|Is that...a staff?|
98131|Uh, a talking staff...Whatever, I don't care! I just wanna get stronger!|
98132|Hah... hah... is it almost over yet?|
98133|I...I feel...what is going on? Is that...my heart?!|
98134|I'm a...monster?! Damn...I don't feel any stronger...|
98135|I haven't even begun to fulfill my duties! I cannot die ! I cannot!|
98136|Huff...huff...finally...it's finished?|
98137|This is...what I look like now...|
98138|I guess that is the price I have to pay for the strength that I need...|
98139|I'm still alive, yet my heart is still and cold. I'm no longer a mere human...but a monster...|
98140|Monster...monster? Ha...Haha...Hahaha!!|
98141|That's right...Margaret, the weak human, is gone...dead!|
98142|Now I am better...a monster! I am powerful at last!|
98143|Now I am ready to seek my revenge... I...am Aveline!|
98144|Tavana...Where is she?! Where!|
98145|She must be around here, somewhere...|
98146|Who's there? Show yourself!|
98147|A human? What are you doing following me around?|
98148|Vile creature! Leave this place!|
98149|Leave? Hah! No, I believe not... Not before I have avenged my family!|
98150|Oh? Well, well. I guess you'll just have to leave the hard way. Die!|
98151|Hmph...you? You think you can take my life?|
98152|There are so many of you... You must have been preparing for this.|
98153|No matter! You can have an entire army here and it won't change a thing! I do not fancy fighting humans, but...|
98154|Cut the chit-chat, come one everyone!|
98155|Kill!!!|
98156|Huff... Huff...|
98157|Heh heh....|
98158|I already told you, you could have as many people fighting as you want, but it won't change a thing.|
98159|I do not kill humans. Just leave...|
98160|Ahhhh, go back to Pandemonium! You monster!|
98161|She... She's not breathing! She's dead!|
98162|That monster killed him!! Destroy that creature!|
98163|We won't let it walk out of here alive!|
98164|Slay the monster!|
98165|You!|
98166|Despicable....|
98167|Uh ah!|
98168|Oh ah!|
98169|Mon...monster...you, you will die soon...|
98170|Ha! Haha! Hahaha!|
98171|Monster? You ARE right, I am indeed a monster!|
98172|I am a Monster...Monster! I will kill all of you!|
98173|I am a monster, and I hunger for your deaths! Hahaha! Hahaha...|
98174|What a thing of beauty! I just can't get enough of this place.|
98175|I'm starving... Time for mom's delicious home-cooked meal!|
98176|No... No...|
98177|Eh? How do you know our names?|
98178|Mr. Papaya told us you would be here! He asked me to come find you.|
98179|Oh, your uncle sent you here.|
98180|Dad? Hmm...alrighty then! I, the team leader, give you permission to join us, the great and powerful Melon Team!|
98181|He never said he wanted to join us, Egusi! Aren't you a being a bit of a braggart?|
98182|Argh, Sharlyn! For once in your life can you stop complaining about me in front of people?! You're so embarrassing!|
98183|Heh! Hmm...I, er, look forward to your guidance, team leader!|
98184|Egusi, I'm hungry...|
98185|Ha! You're always the only one who's hungry! Ok, let's go get some food.|
98186|Cucumber, you wanna come along?|
98187|Sure.|
98188|Hey, Egusi, can you slow down?!|
98189|What?! Hey, my food has disappeared! How can this be...|
98190|Hang on a minute. These are not my footprints!|
98191|Vanishing food... someone else's footprints... Oh my God, someone stole my food!|
98192|There's a crook sneaking about... and I'm gonna catch me a thief!|
98193|Damn, I'm too hungry to fight... Okay, I give up.|
98194|Listen, how about we share the food...? There's more than enough for two people.|
98195|You're such a skinny wretch. I mean, that little dog next door looks stronger and healthier than you! Although... it's shorter than you, I guess.|
98196|You're filthy, too. Say, where are your parents?|
98197|Incredible! You ate every last bite, including the veggie sandwich I made! I don't even dare to try...|
98198|Hey, I thought Hornwolves were strictly carnivores. I'm surprised that you eat vegetables like bell peppers and whatnot.|
98199|Hmm... How would you like to move in with me? I'll cook for you on a regular basis!|
98200|Great! Finally, I won't have to suffer my bad cooking anymore! Someone will be there to eat it all up.|
98201|Let's go home and get my mom to give you a long, hot bath. You're really dirty, you know...|
98202|If I'm reading this map right, we should be in the right place...|
98203|No! Fenrir! Pay attention to what you're eating!|
98204|... Intoxicating Grass?! No, Fenrir, no! No!|
98205|Fenrir stands open-mouthed, looking innocently at Torian.|
98206|Gnnnaaa?|
98207|Don't play games with me! I've told you a thousand times: Mind. What. You. Eat!|
98208|You're a Hornwolf! That's right, a Hornwolf. Oh what, you thought you were a herbivore? A Rabbit, maybe?|
98209|And that right there is Intoxicating Grass! It's a core ingredient in Dream Wine brewing. And you... you ate one of only three bunches on the entire continent!|
98210|Phantom Bunnyhops are the only creatures to drink Dream Wine. Now how am I supposed to catch one without any Dream Wine, hm? Huh?|
98211|Grrrrr...|
98212|Oh well. Now is not the time for the blame game. But by Gaia I'm gonna punish you for this... later!|
98213|Mhm, what a spectacular aroma! This Intoxicating Grass is incredibly rare.|
98214|I feel... a bit... sleepy...|
98215|(Yaaawwwnnn...)|
98216|Mhm...|
98217|...hey! My food... No one is eating it...|
98218|Aaaaoooo!|
98219|Last place?! No... no! Oh, it was all just a dream.|
98220|Huh? Wait, where did all the Intoxicating Grass go?|
98221|Aaargh!|
98222|Lull your enemies to sleep and then flee? I never expected Intoxicating Grass to employ such advanced tactics...|
98223|But how did you manage to stay awake? You're saying Hornwolves are immune to its soporific effects?|
98224|(Yawn...) Uff.|
98225|... So you were asleep... until you got hungry in your dream? (That's one gluttonous Hornwolf...)|
98226|Alright, let's head back and brew some Dream Wine!|
98227|This should be the Phantom Bunnyhop's natural habitat.|
98228|Eh? Aiiiiiiiiiieeeee!!!|
98229|Fenrir!|
98230|Get back here!! If we don't catch a Phantom Bunnyhop then you'll have nothing but bones to eat all month!|
98231|Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow...|
98232|Shhh!!! You're scaring away the Bunnyhops. Keep quiet, man!|
98233|So this is the legendary meat... Hang on, I don't notice any differences between this and normal Bunnyhop meat.|
98234|Oh well, we'll let our taste buds be the judge.|
98235|Oh wow... such a unique flavor and amazing texture... I can see why the taste is so legendary!|
98236|Nom nom nom... Uff...|
98237|We have to stop eating now. I can't fit another bite. I will use the remaining Bunnyhops to try out some new recipes.|
98238|Sounds good... just make sure the Bunnyhops are not actually awake.|
98239|Fenrir!!!!|
98240|Don't you realize how difficult and demanding it is to catch a Phantom Bunnyhop?! We have to find Intoxicating Grass in order to brew some Dream Wine before we can even attempt to catch one. It's a nightmare!|
98241|Yet here you are, stuffing your face with our precious ingredients! Every. Darn. Time!|
98242|Last week it was that icy coastal fish, before that it was a speedy elk, and before that the rocky cattle herd... you're incorrigible!|
98243|Grrrrr...|
98244|Fenrir! If you leave now you're never coming back, ya hear?|
98245|Grrrrr...|
98246|Grr?|
98247|Ah...|
98248|Aaargh!|
98249|Who's there? Don't you know what time it is right now?|
98250|What?! Oh, it's a... you're a... a... a Hornwolf?! Heeeeeelp!!!|
98251|What's going on here?|
98252|Th... the... th-there's a Hornwolf inside! It's really, really big!|
98253|A Hornwolf? How did a Hornwolf come to be here... You there -- request reinforcements.|
98254|Yes, sir!|
98255|Everyone else, help me evacuate the residents in the area. Prepare to surround the restaurant!|
98256|Yes, sir!|
98257|...eh?|
98258|Target sighted, everyone stay on high alert!|
98259|Yes, sir!|
98260|Hornwolves are usually difficult to control, but this one is an exception...|
98261|(Sniff...) It actually smells like booze. Is it... drunk?|
98262|An alcoholic Hornwolf, now there's a new one. Unbelievable!|
98263|Tsk, tsk. Enough liquor for 30 people and it's all gone, every last drop. What a shame. What a loss.|
98264|Look, it also ate all that food! I'd say that was at least 30 gold coins worth of food!|
98265|What?! The food is that expensive?! I admit there was a lot of food there, but charging 30 gold coins would be a bit much, don't you think?|
98266|Don't you know where we are? This restaurant is well-known for its delicious but pricey cuisine.|
98267|This Hornwolf has good taste, I guess. It only took the expensive ingredients and left the rest untouched.|
98268|What do we do now, Leader Rennes?|
98269|Bind its limbs together tightly! A live Hornwolf will fetch a handsome price on the market. In fact, it may more or less make up for the restaurant's losses.|
98270|Leader Rennes is such a nice guy. How come he's not more popular among the opposite sex?|
98271|So tell me, how often have women rejected Leader Rennes' advances? 18? 19? More?|
98272|20 times? Hah! Remember those twins from abroad?|
98273|You mean Elaine and Emily?|
98274|When did that happen? And why is this the first I'm hearing of it?!|
98275|Well, you were en route to your hometown. That's why. Haha!|
98276|... Quiet! Stop the gossip and finish your work, otherwise I'm going to dock your salaries!|
98277|Yes, sir!|
98278|What are you trying to do to Fenrir?!|
98279|It has been a full day now since Fenrir ran away. Maybe I was too harsh in my scolding...?|
98280|Nah, it can't be that. Fenrir's mind is a one-track food machine and he's probably forgotten everything by now.|
98281|But then where has it run off to? I have a bad feeling about this...|
98282|Sigh... I never should have taken it in. It was a bad idea from the get-go.|
98283|Huh? A town, you say? Fenrir went to town?|
98284|Ah... Oh God, it's even worse than I thought!|
98285|Should be this way...  |
98286|Uhn... zZz... zZz...|
98287|..........|
98288|Hmm... Excuse me, sir, but it seems that my friend Fenrir has caused you some trouble...|
98289|Mayor!|
98290|Why is the mayor coming?|
98291|Mayor Layla is joining us!|
98292|Mayor, you should not bother coming.|
98293|Welcome to Kala, Cowtribe traveler.|
98294|Erm, thank you.|
98295|I heard you came looking for a Hornwolf. You mean Fenrir? So you know this Hornwolf, I take it?|
98296|Well, yes. Yes I do. Its name is Fenrir and we've been friends since childhood.|
98297|Alright then, so you take responsibility for this Hornwolf's actions?|
98298|Well, I... I suppose so. What did Fenrir do, exactly?|
98299|Oh it's no big deal, you know... It just broke into the most expensive restaurant in all of Kala, ate all the food supplies, drank all the wine reserves, scared the living spirits out of the head waitress, and woke everyone up in the middle of the night.|
98300|Every last off-duty guard was called in for reinforcement, it was a huge circus. And it turns out that I'm the one who's financially liable for this little stunt.|
98301|Here she comes! Kala's most terrifying femme fatale!|
98302|Shh, keep your voice down... The mayor might hear you!|
98303|I expected the Cowtribe guy to be soaking wet. I feel bad for him...|
98304|So sorry for causing you all this trouble! I will compensate you for the damages, I promise.|
98305|Very well, then. |
98306|That includes the cost of the food and wine plus extra coin for the mental anguish and guards' fees. That'll be 10,008 gold coins in total. Let's make it 10,000 and call it even, yeah?|
98307|10,000 gold coins... This mayor sure knows how to run a racket.|
98308|I heard that the town's expenses are soaring this month.|
98309|That poor Cowtribe guy... I hope he's a decent negotiator.|
98310|What? 10,000 gold coins?! That's a hefty price tag!|
98311|Um, listen... I only have 5,000 gold coins.|
98312|Not enough, you say? I guess I'll have to sell the Hornwolf...|
98313|No, w-w-wait!! Take these gems instead!|
98314|Hmm... not too shabby. I'd say these are worth about 5,000 gold coins, give or take. You can have your Hornwolf back now.|
98315|Oh thank you, thank you! I'm so sorry for the trouble...|
98316|Gnnnaaa?|
98317|Let's go! You stupid, dumb, ridiculous Hornwolf!|
98318|You're welcome to join us again!|
98319|Have we been here before? Did we get lost again?|
98320|Boss! That woman! She's the one who destroyed my home!|
98321|Are you sure she did it on purpose?|
98322|If she did it once, sure. But she's done it over and over and over! She's evil!|
98323|Look at what she's done to my home! She'll pay!|
98324|Yeah, you're right! The boss'll teach her a lesson!|
98325|B-boss... are you sure about this?|
98326|What, are you afraid? We go in on three! One! Two! One! Two! One...|
98327|Boss, why aren't you saying three?|
98328|Shut up! There's no reason to be afraid! THREE!|
98329|Let's go!|
98330|Wahoo!|
98331|Watch out!|
98332|Ah?|
98333|Wow! Wow! Wow!|
98334|Wooooooooooooo!|
98335|What are you doing?|
98336|Stop, stop, stop! You can't just kill people!|
98337|But they started it!|
98338|I don't care! You can't just kill someone!|
98339|Well, fine. It isn't like I wanted to anyway.|
98340|What?!|
98341|You are very strange, you know that? My name is Hel. What's yours?|
98342|Hel... the Queen of Shadows, Hel? No wonder you're so cruel!|
98343|Oh, you've heard of me? Well, then why haven't you introduced yourself? It is very rude not to share your name with someone whose name you know!|
98344|You dare suggest that I'm rude? Listen carefully! I'm Bealdor, the god of light!|
98345|Oh ho! No wonder you're so shiny!|
98346|Well, thank you! I mean... I don't honestly care what you think of how I look.|
98347|You should! I have impeccable taste.|
98348|Look, I really don't care. Why are you here anyway?|
98349|I got lost. Do you know the way to my home?|
98350|How would I know? I've never been there!|
98351|I guess that makes sense. I suppose I'll have to wait for Gram to find me. No idea how long that'll take though...|
98352|Well... I guess I could wait here with you. It is a pretty nice place to hang out. Besides, it would be rude to abandon you.|
98353|Ah hah! You'll keep me company? You are so nice Bealdor!|
98354|Look, I'm just doing it out of politeness. Don't get any ideas in your head.|
98355|My lady! I was so worried about you! Let me take you home!|
98356|Ah, Gram! You were so fast. I didn't know home was so close!|
98357|Yes, my lady. No world spanning journey this time! Just a short hop, skip, and a jump to find you.|
98358|It also helped that your aura was particularly strong today. It made finding you much easier.|
98359|Ah, I always forget about that. I will have to make sure I keep my aura up whenever I am lost.|
98360|No worries, my lady. Are you ready to return home?|
98361|Hey! Hey! Stop ignoring me!|
98362|Oh! Gram, this my new friend, Bealdor.|
98363|Your friend? I'm not your friend!|
98364|But I'm your friend Bealdor. It would be terribly rude for you not to be my friend as well.|
98365|Well then I guess I don't have a choice but to say yes. How could I turn down someone who so clearly needs a friend?|
98366|(Bealdor... Bealdor... that names rings a bell. Ah! Yes, the god of light! I would not have expected him to be... like this.)|
98367|Yay! Bealdor, you are great!|
98368|Yeah, sure, whatever. What a silly goddess...|
98369|I believe I shall come here again sometime and visit you. Now that that is settled, let's go, Gram.|
98370|Wait! I never said I'd come here again or visit you! Hey, wait! Wait!|
98371|Lord Bealdor, I am Gram. I have served my lady for thousands of years. You are her first friend. Please do not disappoint her.|
98372|Now I must depart. Thank you again.|
98373|Like anything could upset her...|
98374|I suppose it is nice around here. I guess I could come back to appreciate the scenery, and if that girl happened to be here... well, that is her business.|
98375|I wonder if Bealdor has been there...|
98376|My lady, are you off to meet with the god of light?|
98377|Yes! Did you want to come along?|
98378|My lady, perhaps your shouldn't get too close to him. I realize having a friend is nice, but he is not...|
98379|You don't like Bealdor? But he's so shiny and sparkly!|
98380|(Who gave my lady this love of shiny and bright things?)|
98381|Gram? Are you awake? Whatever, I'm headed out.|
98382|My lady! I still don't think-|
98383|Whatever! Just don't get in my way or I'll make you pay. Whoops! Too late!|
98384|What?!|
98385|Aw, time for me to go, Bealdor. See you next time?|
98386|Will you be okay getting home on your own?|
98387|It isn't that far. I think. I mean this place looks familiar. I think. Oh...|
98388|Which direction did I come from? I think I'm lost again...|
98389|Oh blast. I wonder if Gram has woken up yet...|
98390|Oh! I was just thinking about you! You sure woke back up quickly.|
98391|Thank you for the compliment, my lady. I must admit, however, that the Grand Master assisted my awakening with a swift kick.|
98392|Oh, my brother's back? I guess I should go welcome them.|
98393|Yes, my lady. Both masters have returned. They are waiting for you.|
98394|By the way, my lady. You wanted the right path.|
98395|Oh. That'd explain why I was lost! You should probably lead the way!|
98396|Yes, my lady.|
98397|(I wish my lady would pay more attention to where she was going... She always wants to lead, but never goes the right way...)|
98398|Bealdor should be here soon...|
98399|Gram, I'm in a hurry! Out of my way!|
98400|Grand Master!|
98401|Wait, where is my big brother?|
98402|Gram, where is he?|
98403|He's not here, my lady.|
98404|What? You lied to me?|
98405|No, my lady. I was trying to say that he would be visiting you soon. For the sake of my health, I beg you to please stay home today.|
98406|When my lady is not around, the Grand Master gets bored and take it on me. So please, please, please, my lady, stay home until he visits.|
98407|Hmmmm...|
98408|Okay, Gram. I will stay home, but I need you to deliver a message to Bealdor for me. Okay?|
98409|Yes, my lady.|
98410|Oh! Right! I need to remember to give this to big brother! I keep forgetting to!|
98414|Bealdor? That brat intends to take my lovely Hel away? In his dreams.|
98415|You are so slow today...|
98416|You jerk, Bealdor! I never want to see you again! Ever!|
98417|Hey. Hey! What's your problem?|
98418|What is wrong with her? She mad I called her a silly girl or something? It's never bothered her before...|
98419|Who cares. A goddess is nothing but trouble anyway...|
98420|Silly Hel. She likes shining, glittering things, right? She'd probably love the Light of Dawn.|
98421|The Light of Dawn... the purest light in the world... Yeah, she'd love it.|
98422|The entrance to her home... where is it?|
98423|Ugh. I should have had her draw a map for me. Not that she'd remember how to get home anyway.|
98424|Ugh. I think this is the way Gram went...|
98425|Lord Bealdor, wait a moment.|
98426|Gram, just the servant I was looking for! Is Hel in?|
98427|My lady is visiting the young master. What business has brought you here today?|
98428|I came to offer her a gift as an apology. I suppose it can't be helped though. Could you give her this? Tell her it is from me, please.|
98429|An apology?|
98430|Yes. She was quite upset with me a few days go.|
98432|(That must be what happened. So he came to make amends?)|
98433|(Ridiculous!)|
98435|So, you wanted to apologize by offering my lady a gift?|
98436|Yes! Here, could you take a look at it? I've never given a gift before, so I don't know if it is any good...|
98437|This is a gift for my lady. I do not think I should be looking at it...|
98438|(I must admit, I am curious as to what sort of gift this fool would give to my lady. Still, it would be wrong for me to open it. Besides, something feels... strange about this box.)|
98439|What if Hel doesn't like it, though? Here, just take a look!|
98440|Gram! I came back! I didn't even get lost!|
98441|This is... the Light of Dawn? Gosh!|
98442|G-Gram?|
98443|Gram!|
98444|Who are you? Why are you pretending to be Bealdor?|
98445|Pretending? I-|
98446|I won't forgive you for hurting Gram!|
98447|Hel! Listen to me!|
98448|I AM Bealdor!|
98449|If you're really Bealdor, why would you hurt Gram?|
98450|What? I didn't hurt Gram!|
98451|But you brought the Light of Dawn here!|
98452|Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?|
98453|The Light of Dawn purifies things! Gram was a magic spirit that took control of a sword! The Light of Dawn is too much for him to withstand!|
98454|It destroyed his form!|
98455|What? I-I didn't know... I just wanted to...|
98456|You didn't know that? You really are a spoiled prince, kept ignorant by your mother!|
98457|Gram...|
98458|I came to check on you. It looks like Gram is not very lucky.|
98459|Will Gram be okay?|
98460|I don't know. Even if he could transform back... he wouldn't be the same Gram. His memories are gone.|
98461|Hel, I'm so sorry...|
98462|Get out of here, you fool, spoiled prince! Never return! Never show yourself in front of Hel again!|
98463|You have no right to stop her from making friends?|
98464|Friend? That is quite a thing to consider yourself after killing Gram!|
98465|It was-|
98466|Gram... Gram...|
98467|Foolish prince! Gram is precious to Hel. She once stopped talking to her eldest brother for a thousand years for talking ill of Gram!|
98468|But Gram was just a servant! He said so himself!|
98469|Perhaps. But Hel thought much more of him.|
98470|We are reluctant to admit it, but Gram was like another brother to her. Perhaps the one who knew her best.|
98471|I...|
98472|Now you know everything. Get out, spoiled prince.|
98473|Hel... I...|
98474|Can't you see she never wants to speak to you again?|
98475|Let's go, Hel. We'll find a safe place for Gram...|
98476|Hmm...|
98477|Hel...|
98478|I really don't like it here.|
98479|If you want to get the Light of Dawn...|
98480|...all you'll be able to do is catch what little dawn light you can find.|
98481|Ugh... I've only got five coins. I can't even afford bread...|
98482|You! This is all your fault! You have to be a vegan for a month!|
98483|What? I... uh... ah...|
98484|You can play cute and innocent, but that won't work on me!|
98485|I must find that food-grabbing thief!|
98486|Where should I look?|
98487|You guessed incorrectly|
98488|Not here...|
98489|I'll help you find it!|
98490|You gave the food to Torian!|
98491|Freeze!|
98492|Give me that food back!|
98493|Have you seen those Tiny Hornwolves? They're soooo cute! I want one for myself!|
98494|Hmm, indeed... With a bit more meat on their bones, I'd say they'd be QUITE delicious.|
98495|C-C-Cucumber! How could you even THINK about eating it?! It's so cute!!|
98496|Ha! Why not? Look at it! Perfect size for roasting, I'd say! Crispy on the outside... tender on the inside... Mmm, just thinking about it makes my mouth water!|
98497|C-C-Cucumber! I'm... I'm gonna go find Belon!|
98498|Again?! Ugh, fine! Well, you won't get a peep out of me!|
98499|Though come to think of it, how come our glorious Team Leader hasn't stopped by today?|
98500|He's helping out his older sister who's coming home tomorrow. He probably won't be able to stop by tomorrow either.|
98501|Huh? He has a sister? I never knew that!|
98502|Yes, she got married and moved abroad a few years back. She doesn't come home often, so her father is always absolutely delighted when she does, giving her all sorts of things to take back with her.|
98503|Hmm, I see... Well, now I'm curious to see what she's like.|
98504|Oh, she's just a doll! Real soft-spoken, but quite the beauty. A great cook too! Belon and I both have a real soft spot for her.|
98505|Oh, hey! Speaking of food... let's get some ourselves!|
98506|Food, food, food! That's all you ever think about!|
98507|Well, it's important, you know! It's one of the bare necessities of life!|
98508|I suppose you're right about that, and it IS about that time... I guess there'd be no harm in getting a bite to eat.|
98509|Exactly right! Let's fill up our tums. Though I wonder if Belon's finished already...|
98510|Well, why don't we stop by his house on the way?|
98511|Perfect plan! Let's go!|
98512|Mm-hm! Sounds great! Food, food, food...|
98513|Huh? C-Cucumber, what are you DOING?!|
98514|Mmmmmm... roast chicken...|
98515|...I thought you said you were full! Do you have a black hole for a stomach?|
98516|Ha! You think a few measly bites can satiate THIS hunger?|
98517|Measly bites?! You've wiped out five River Snail Skewers, eight slices of Honey & Jam Toast, three Sweet and Sour Pork Balls, ten Vanilla Macaroons, and polished all that off with two cups of Fruit Honey Tea!|
98518|Hmm... you're right. I should eat some more.|
98519|Y-you're a bottomless pit!|
98520|Sometimes I do wonder why I eat so much... Maybe it's because I was abandoned as a kid...|
98521|What? Abandoned? Oh hey, everyone's starting to move.|
98522|Yeah, who cares about alla that anyway, right? Let's get some more FOOD!|
98523|Huh? Did we get here too late? And you just got done eating ten meals literally five seconds ago.|
98524|Oh, hush it! I'm still hungry, okay?!|
98525|Let's go!|
98526|Huh? What's so funny, Cucumber?|
98527|Ahaha, oh, it's nothing... just that our Team Leader's really just a big ole softie behind all that tough talk.|
98528|It's true. At least his heart is in the right place, even if he needs his mouth washed out with soap!|
98529|He really is a good guy. It's no wonder you like him so much.|
98530|Yeah, yeah, we did! He's the best! But I like you and Cucumber too, of course!|
98531|Hm? What's up? You look like someone just stole your favorite teddy bear.|
98532|I-it's nothing... it's just... Team Leader and Cucumber are already so far away... We'll never be able to catch up if we don't hurry.|
98533|Ahh... w-well, let's get going then! Before Belon scolds us!|
98534|Ugh, even Kramer wouldn't eat something like this!|
98535|The last one!|
98536|Holy cripes!|
98537|This seems to be the place. All units, halt! Prepare to make camp.|
98538|Yars, Shirley, and I will patrol the area first and see if there are any traces of demons.|
98539|Very well. Take care.|
98540|Get a move on, we need to set up a base before the enemy attacks!|
98541|You might need to reinforce these defenses...|
98542|Reporting! Commander, Ashe and Shirley haven't returned yet.|
98543|How can that be? You, you, you, and you, take some troops and find them!|
98544|Ashe! Shirley! Can you hear me?!|
98545|Ashe! Shirley! Where are you?!|
98546|I've found Ashe! Hmm...|
98547|It looks like there was a fierce battle here. Ashe is badly injured and I still haven't found Shirley. What can I do?|
98548|They seem to have encountered demons. You take Ashe back; I'll carry on searching.|
98549|Very well... Be careful.|
98550|Hmm... What is this place? Shirley! Urgh...|
98551|Don't move! You're badly injured. The doctor said you need to rest!|
98552|Igar, where's Shirley?|
98553|She...she... We only found you, not her...|
98554|What are you doing? Don't get up!|
98555|Enough about me. I'm going to find Yars!|
98556|Ashe, you're finally awake! You all came searching for me. Did you miss me that much?!|
98557|Yars, give me some troops. I'll find Shirley!|
98558|I...I can't do that... Sorry, Ashe.|
98559|Why not? Don't you care about Shirley?|
98560|It's not that... You've been unconscious for days. I've requested more troops to search for Shirley, but High Command refused...|
98561|And you just gave up?!|
98562|My hands are tied... I received this today... It's your discharge order...|
98563|Why? Because I'm wounded? I've done so much for my country and all the thanks I get is this piece of paper?!|
98564|Ashe... It's not like that...|
98565|Get out...|
98566|Ashe?|
98567|I said get out! I need to be alone! Go!|
98568|...|
98569|Let's go... Give him a moment.|
98570|I heard a new member wants to join the Sharlyn Adventure Team.|
98571|Really? Is it a beautiful woman? Or a cute girl? Am I finally about to get a taste of romance?|
98572|What? I thought you had a thing for our leader? I thought she was the only one for you!|
98573|What are you on about?! Shut up!|
98574|Then why does your face go bright red every time you see her?|
98575|It doesn't! She's mean and aggressive, not kind and gentle...|
98576|Who are you calling mean and aggressive?!|
98577|I said, our lead... erm... you!|
98578|Of course, our lead... erm... you!|
98579|Ah! Ma'am, nice weather today. Who is that cute girl with you?|
98580|Oh?! She's the newest member of our team. Say hello.|
98581|Hello, my name is Cucumber. I look forward to working with you, hehe!|
98582|Wow, you're so cute. Cucumber is such a lovely name. Mine's Muskmelon!|
98583|Will you be my girlfriend?|
98584|Idiot. You can't just come right out and say that on the first day! You need to wait at least seven days!|
98585|Seven days? Why seven?|
98586|That's how long it takes for her to crawl out of the screen and get you!|
98587|Hey, what are you whispering about? Tell Cucumber!|
98588|No... it's nothing...|
98589|Dammit. Why? How can they treat me like this just because I'm wounded?|
98590|Ashe, don't be like this. Maybe you'll be able to come back after a while.|
98591|Yars, don't try to comfort me. Just go. Leave me alone.|
98592|Very well...|
98593|At that moment, Ashe senses someone else come in.|
98594|Yars, just leave me alone.|
98595|Do you want to go search for Shirley?|
98596|Who are you?|
98597|I don't care who you are. If you want to look for Shirley, come with me.|
98598|...|
98599|What's this?|
98600|This is the fruits of my labor. I've named it Thousand Nights. Now all I need is someone to pilot it.|
98601|What are you doing here?|
98602|If you don't want to do it, you can go. I haven't got the time to waste with you.|
98603|Fine! In return, you have to bring Shirley back for me...|
98604|Excellent, I love speaking with intelligent people. You can start learning how to pilot it. I can't wait to see how you get on!|
98605|All of this...is for Shirley. I'd willingly enter Pandemonium to find her.|
98606|I'll even pray to the gods to aid me. Demons, I will use you to test my strength.|
98607|Bullseye! Looks like I'm a natural!|
98608|Ashe! Ashe! Where are you?! You're here!?|
98609|I just received an order. You won't be discharged!|
98610|Really?!|
98611|Yes, but there is a condition attached. They want you to pilot that for official use in combat.|
98612|Understood.|
98613|Ashe?|
98614|Hmm?|
98615|No, it's nothing. I just want to tell you: I'm glad you stayed.|
98616|No! No! Ashe!|
98617|Yes...I was captured...but why did they capture me? And why were they wearing our uniform?|
98618|I just heard her voice. How come she's not asleep?|
98619|You must have heard wrong! Didn't the boss say she'll sleep for at least a few more days?|
98620|I just don't understand why the boss wanted to capture her. Didn't he say he wanted a man?|
98621|He hasn't said why, but I saw some pretty high-ranking officers visiting him. They were talking about some kind of experiment.|
98622|Experiment? What kind of experiment?|
98623|This is the bottle! Don't underestimate it. I heard this potion was diluted using demon blood and anyone who drinks it will become super powerful, but there side effects. Everyone who's drunk it has died, so it's not ready for mass production.|
98624|High-ranking officers? Demons? Could they be rebels?|
98625|Hey! She's not really asleep!|
98626|Damn, she probably heard everything we just said!|
98627|Well then, weren't you just saying something about an experiment? You might as well test the potion on her!|
98628|Alright! May as well do it now. Grab her!|
98629|Argh! No! Stay away! Let me go! Urgh...|
98630|It hurts... Stop...|
98631|She's changing! Looks like it's working!|
98632|Don't you think something is off?|
98633|(Kill... I must kill... Kill!)|
98634|What are you doing? What's all the noise?! Huh? What's happened?|
98635|Get over here! Something's happened!|
98636|What...what have I done?|
98637|Ashe... I'm glad you're not here...|
98638|Quickly! There he is! They've stopped!|
98639|Surround him! Don't let him get away!|
98640|I...I can't stay here...but...where should I go?|
98641|Someone's calling me... Who?|
98642|Yes...|
98643|A demon! Cool!|
98644|Is it? I think it's scary... I guess you've never seen their vicious side?|
98645|Is it? I think it's scary... I guess you've never seen her vicious side?|
98646|Wait, but you're clearly a girl!|
98647|Did I say I was a girl?|
98648|What? Are you a boy?|
98649|Such a cute boy! So, the legend WAS true!|
98650|Yeah, but my chances at romance have pretty much flown the coop.|
98651|It's not that sad. You just don't actually like girls.|
98652|W-w-what are you talking about?!|
98653|You really have to ask? Come on, now! If you had to choose between an ugly old man and a pretty boy, which would you choose?|
98654|Well, um, the pretty bo-... h-hey! Why do I have to choose between two guys?!|
98655|Ohoho! See? Just be honest with yourself! Now then, I'm wanted elsewhere. Tootles!|
98656|What? Hey! Where are you going?|
98657|You two! How could you just leave a girl alone like that?! Wait for me!|
98658|You're back.|
98659|Do you know where Yars... Urgh...|
98660|Ashe?! Ashe, wake up!|
98661|Russell, what's going on? Why is Ashe fainting so often?|
98662|It's because he doesn't have long left to live.|
98663|What? But why?|
98664|Didn't you know that the robot uses human life as a power source?|
98665|His blood is truly special. All the ones before him only lasted a few days.|
98666|So you were lying when you said you'd look for Shirley?|
98667|He doesn't have long left. It's not important whether she's found or not.|
98668|You... I'm going to report this. You'd better find a way to save Ashe, or else...|
98669|Don't be so naive. Without orders from higher-up, do you think I'd have...|
98670|Am I going to die soon?|
98671|However long I have, I've got to find Shirley...|
98672|Alert! Demons are attacking! All personnel, defend the gates!|
98673|Demons are attacking! All personnel, defend the gates!|
98674|Hmph... Demons again. Since I'm already dead, I may as well take out as many as I can!|
98675|It looks like Russell was telling the truth. When I sit in here, all I feel is the desire to slaughter the enemy... Hehe...|
98676|Ashe...|
98677|What? Are you calling me?|
98678|(Why does that voice sound like Shirley's?)|
98679|Shirley, is that you? Don't go!|
98680|No, I can't let him get away! Go after him!|
98681|You keep up with him. Don't let Ashe get hurt.|
98682|Yes, sir!|
98683|Shirley... You're Shirley... Wait for me!|
98684|Urgh...|
98685|I got you! I'm sorry, but I need an answer? Are you Shirley?|
98686|No.|
98687|That voice... Yes! You must be Shirley. That's Shirley's voice. I'd recognize it anywhere!|
98688|Why do you look like that?|
98689|...|
98690|Answer me! Shirley! Please!|
98691|Catch them!|
98692|Ashe, have you captured him? Finish him!|
98693|I'm back here again...|
98694|What? Shirley, what do you mean?|
98695|Ashe, what are you doing? Why don't you finish him?!|
98696|Yars, it's no good! I can't do it!|
98697|Get on with it. He's the enemy. Did you forget that he just attacked us?!|
98698|Yars, Igar, it's Shirley! I can't hurt Shirley!|
98699|What are you talking about?! How could Shirley be a demon?! If you can't finish him, come here. We'll do it.|
98700|...|
98701|No... It's Shirley. My precious Shirley!|
98702|So you wanna be with this demon? Fine, just give the robot back!|
98703|Russell, give it a rest. Ashe could be...|
98704|Sorry, Yars. But if you want to hurt her, you'll have to go through me first!|
98705|Argh! Go away! I don't want to hurt you!|
98706|Ashe, are you really going to betray us?|
98707|Yars... It's Shirley. I'm certain of it. Can't you just let her go?|
98708|Be serious. Don't forget you're only alive thanks to that robot.|
98709|If you wanna protect that demon, then give the robot back!|
98710|No! If I do that, you won't let Shirley go!|
98711|Fine! Since you wanna be a hero, I'll help you along! Charge!|
98712|No! Ashe's still there... And he said that's Shirley...|
98713|Asda, do you mean to follow him in his treachery?|
98714|No... It's just that...|
98715|That's enough! All units, charge! Otherwise I'll report every one of you to High Command and you'll all be court-martialed!|
98716|...|
98717|What are you doing?! Attack!|
98718|No... Ashe... Shirley...|
98719|Yars, it's alright. I won't let you all become traitors because of me...|
98720|I'm sorry, Yars. Thank you for everything...|
98721|Ashe, I'm glad you could be here with me in my final moment...|
98722|Shirley... Me too... This time we won't be separated...|
98723|What are you waiting for?! Attack! Attack or you'll be court-martialed! You'll all be traitors!|
98724|Sorry, Ashe.|
98725|Sorry, Shirley.|
98726|Alert! Alert! Enemy attack!|
99001|Humph, a fluke! Reid and the Lightning Gang only managed to defeat Hogan because they were lucky.|
99002|The next Ham League generation will never lose the competition!|
99003|The Ham League will win that Huge Corn yet, wait and see!|
99004|I can't help but feel bad for Shiloh and the Ham League....|
99005|For the good of Paco and the Lightning Gang, we'll give it our best shot!|
99006|We'll never give up the Huge Corn that easily!|
99007|You're happy today, aren't you, Hogan! You'll be even happier tomorrow with the Huge Corn!|
99008|Paco! Use your Electric Lightening Tail!|
99009|If these prehistorical relics are damaged, it'll be the greatest archaeological loss of our lifetime!|
99010|If we fail to pass on what we've learned about this precious ancient culture, it will be a terrible loss to the whole world...|
99011|Thank you for all the efforts you've made in order to preserve our ancient heritage!|
99012|You've made many contributions to our research here! You now understand that research isn't as easy as you may think! Thank you for your help!|
99013|Hmm...this is...|
99014|According to our texts...this should be...|
99015|Wow!! Is this what I think it is?!|
99016|Haha! The discoveries we've made today are so exciting!|
100001|Hey! You over there!|
100002|Hi! I'm Floret, the Guardian Sprite of the village. I only look like this because of Daq's curse.|
100003|I will open the path for you; just follow the lights on the ground.|
100004|Nooo! They've found me!|
100005|Return me to my original form!|
100006|Hm... Nah. This look suits you much better!|
100007|You...! I'll... I'll nibble you to death!|
100008|Ha! This light is too much for you, isn't it? You can't avoid it even when you're cowering in the mud!|
100009|Change me back right now!|
100010|Ha ha! Is that supposed to hurt?|
100011|I would never have guessed that you could have tracked me all the way here.|
100012|That will be the last time you surprise me. Attack!|
100013|Daq!|
100014|Aaaah!|
100015|You idiot! Stay where you are!|
100016|Hah! Look at you, always trying and failing to say something clever.|
100017|Squawk! Being turned into a parrot is exactly what you deserve!|
100018|You should be grateful! Didn't you always say that you needed to lose a few pounds?|
100019|Now look at those bird legs of yours! It doesn't get any skinnier than that!|
100020|Will you be quiet? Quack! The brave adventurer is here! Don't make a scene!|
100021|You're the one who should be quiet, you ugly duckling!|
100022|...|
100023|Huh? You're actually...|
100024|Melon! Everyone always looked up to you!|
100025|Now that you're all animals, I can see the true nature of your hearts.|
100026|I think it's best if we're just friends. You understand, right?|
100027|Thank you, adventurer!|
100028|Quickly, light the torch!|
100029|Yes! I'm finally back to normal!|
100030|You again! Why are you always in my way?|
100031|Think of how beautiful everything would be without all this miserable light!|
100032|Annoying fools! I will send all of you to Pandemonium!|
100033|No!|
100034|Ugh, I can't take another step. You'll have to go to the last altar alone.|
100035|I will give you my blessing. Go and defeat Daq!|
100036|This is awesome! I'm finally back to the way I used to look!|
100037|Thanks for your help! Thank you so much!|
100038|Thank you!|
100039|This is great!|
100040|Excellent work, Major Gerald.|
100041|Likewise! Now, get some rest!|
100042|Insignificant pests! Die, all of you!|
100043|Hah! Useless rubbish!|
100044|Oh, you wish to die as well? Here, let me assist you!|
100045|Aaaah!|
100046|Unnnhhh...!|
100047|Ahh, it hurts... Waltek... I don't want to die!|
100048|N-no! Caitlyn, stop! C'mon, just stop!|
100049|This... how?! How could I lose to mere humans?! This is unthinkable!|
100050|Wait for me... I'll come back... I promise...|
100051|You dare to destroy the scheme I worked so hard to weave!|
100052|W-what?! W-wait, no! Master Von, it's them...!|
100053|I don't want to hear it!|
100054|Just die!|
100055|I very much wanted to play this scene out a bit more, but everyone seems so rude! What do you think?|
100056|Let us re-write this scene together, shall we?|
100057|This scene shall be called... The Foolish Demise of the Envoy of Gaia. It resonates nicely, don't you agree?|
100058|Now... action!|
100059|Why does the mere sight of a single dragon scale give everyone the chills?|
100060|Nothing would please me more than to continue this with you, but I'm afraid I have more pressing business to attend to.|
100061|Venture a little deeper, if you dare. I'll show you why this place is special.|
100062|Ah, you've finally arrived! I was beginning to worry that you wouldn't show.|
100063|Allow my minion to take care of you.|
100064|Proclaim your loyalty to me once more! I command you, Elryn, to drown this scoundrel in the watery depths of your lair!|
100065|Do it, Elryn! You know the penalty for disobeying me...|
100066|Rubbish! It is all rubbish!|
100067|Oh, it's you two.|
100068|Von, you pathetic fool!|
100069|Elryn! Are you okay?|
100070|Taloc... Flokja...|
100071|Our bodies may be bound to you, Von, but you will never bind our spirits!|
100072|We cannot stand against you alone, but with an Envoy of Gaia...|
100073|Hah! You think all of you together have what it takes to challenge a true dragon like me?!|
100074|What... did you say...?!|
100075|Shut... up!|
100076|Ha ha, cool down a bit! You'll get your chance, it just won't be now.|
100077|Soon, all of you will be annihilated! Ha ha!|
100078|Go, Elryn! We're... no match... for his strength...|
100079|Envoy of Gaia, our kin will see you again soon.|
100080|When the moment arrives... I hope you will aid us in defeating Von. You are our final hope!|
100081|I'll tell you everything...|
100082|Thank you. You did me a solid favor!|
100083|Great! We're saved!|
100084|Whew! We're saved! Alright! Let's go!|
100085|Ah! Don't waste the food! I'll bring it home for my kid!|
100086|Oi! Listen up! I've already arranged to work with some trustworthy people.|
100087|We have to escape from here this time!|
100088|I've prepared some drumstricks and doused them in sleeping medicine.|
100089|Those ugly guards won't be able to resist them.|
100090|Then we can just stroll out of here!|
100091|Go! We'll deal with the two idiots at the door.|
100092|They're underestimating us!|
100093|Right! I want to taste fresh meat!|
100094|You're tired of living, huh? Eat 'em!|
100095|If you carry it, the package will get there on time!|
100096|You just need to deliver this package south of Titan's Grove. Make sure you use the suspension bridge! We'll meet up there!|
100097|I didn't think you'd be able to do it! I owe you one!|
100098|Thank you so very, very much! The delivery is right on time, all thanks to you!|
100099|Sigh...|
100100|Ahhhhhh!|
100101|Ahh!|
100102|Ahhh! Ow! Ahhhhhhh!|
100103|Squeak... squeak!|
100104|Squeak, squeak!|
100105|The moment has arrived!|
100106|Let me take control of this battle.|
100107|What an impudent tone! Let's see what you've really got.|
100108|This is my strongest monster. I've decided! Can you handle the Greater Ice Elemental?|
100109|Greater Ice Elemental, attack Uray!|
100110|Pow!|
100111|(Uray grins cruelly.)|
100112|I knew you'd do that.|
100113|What?|
100114|Greater Ice Elemental, obey me!|
100115|What are you doing?|
100116|Go! Greater Ice Elemental, attack Proudmoore!|
100117|Pow!|
100118|Kwa!|
100119|Why did it turn out like this...? I'm so strong... why...?|
100120|If I could counter magic, then I would be unbeatable!|
100121|The Tome of Magic MUST be in the northeastern quadrant of the Avian Laboratory, but I just couldn't find it...|
100122|Isn't this the long lost Counter Magic Grimoire? Are you really giving it to me?|
100123|I'll study this! Thanks in advance.|
100124|Om...|
100125|Om, om, om, om.|
100126|Om, om, om, om!|
100127|I can't believe I've learned how to counter magic! I feel unstoppable!|
100128|Proudmoore, you're early! You must want to be beaten by me.|
100129|You're as despicable as ever! I'm going to be the winner today!|
100130|Enough! Let's fight!|
100131|Tough talk. Let's see if you have what it takes!|
100132|A fight to the death! It's my turn!|
100133|Haha. Don't be surprised by my trump card!|
100134|You've been chosen! Greater Ice Elemental!|
100135|Attack Uray!|
100136|Pow!|
100137|(Proudmoore grins.)|
100138|I knew you'd do that.|
100139|Witness my counter magic!|
100140|What? My domination spell... it's stopped working!|
100141|Go! Crush him, Greater Ice Elemental!|
100142|Pow!|
100143|Kwa!|
100144|I... didn't expect you to learn counter magic...|
100145|I was... careless...|
100146|I didn't think I would win so easily. It's all thanks to you!|
100147|Thank you, my friend.|
100148|Our mission to destroy their cart and hinder their advance!|
100149|Look alive now! The Church is counting on you!|
100150|Sir!|
100151|Sir, the cart is nearly here.|
100152|Hmm... It seems we can't wait for reinforcements anymore.|
100153|So, some puny humans want to fight us? You foolish upstarts!|
100154|Asleep? I can't believe they've fallen for such a stupid trick!|
100155|My underlings are useless! No wonder you've caused so much trouble!|
100156|I'll eat you all! Any deserters will be my dessert!|
100157|What shall I eat tonight? It looks like you're all on the menu!|
100158|Great, you're here. Let me explain the situation.|
100159|Available|
100160|Available|
100161|Available|
100162|Available|
100163|Weird... I smell something burning.|
100164|What? Someone burned my granary down!|
100165|Blast! How'm I going to explain this to my boss?|
100166|You guys just love setting things on fire, don't you? What do you say I grill you all for lunch!|
100167|Our mission is to destroy as many supply wagons as possible. Everyone, move out!|
100168|We've stolen a lot of rations! What a harvest!|
100169|Hold on, the staff will be with you momentarily!|
100170|I'm as busy as a bee, and I've still got another venue to prepare right after this!|
100171|Your banquet is all set, so I've got to move on!|
100172|This place is huge!|
100173|There's so much space to dance!|
100174|Everyone is having so much fun!|
100175|This reminds me of home!|
100176|This place is a blast!|
100177|The banquet is over. Great work everyone!|
100178|Let's head back.|
100179|Who is it? What could this mean?|
100180|My dumplings!|
100181|You humans are such profligates. My dumplings are ruined!|
100182|I'm hungry again. I think everyone should share their food!|
100183|No way! I wouldn't dare touch our platoon leader's dumplings! He smacked me for looking at them once!|
100184|They smell so good though... My mouth is watering...|
100185|Envoy of Gaia! Thank god you're here. We've got an emergency situation!|
100186|Please follow our Informers once you meet them.|
100187|Are you here to fetch the Grimoire for Dirk? So you're his friend? I must say, I didn't know he was capable of making any friends - that kid is a loner.|
100188|He's also arrogant and delusional... That being said, he's a good kid at heart.|
100189|I sealed that Grimoire to help him stop daydreaming. But who'd have known, one thing led to another, and the whole thing turned into a bigger mess.|
100190|Too bad I'm in another world now, and can't meet him again. Hopefully he can have a good life.|
100191|I'm your man on the inside. Follow me, but hurry - the Ritual is about to begin!|
100192|The Immemorial Beast will be resurrected today! No one shall disturb this great moment! Do you hear me?|
100193|Yes sir! We won't even let a flea get in there.|
100194|Hey, you there! This is a restricted area. You should not be here!|
100195|Oh? Password!|
100196|Stupid fool... I knew you had sent informers, but seriously, they've got to do a much better job if they want to fool us.|
100197|We allowed them to lead you on purpose... In lieu of searching for you ourselves. Now you're all here, like sitting ducks.|
100198|This doesn't concern me. I'll just use the chance to grab something to eat and take a nap...|
100199|Guards! Take them down! None shall escape!|
100200|I must report this to the Commander ASAP. The rest of you, kill them all!|
100201|Immemorial Beast! Heed my call!|
100202|Immemorial Beast, you shall be resurrected today!|
100203|Let us imbue the Immemorial Beast Egg with our power!|
100204|We're almost there! The ritual will be done soon!|
100205|No!|
100206|My egg... you destroyed my egg!|
100207|You've given me no choice!|
100208|Okay, this is the place. My mission is complete!
I'll leave it to you guys to stop the ritual.|
100209|Let me check on everything, Envoy of Gaia.|
100210|That smell... ah! It smells just like those Fried Meatballs my little sister gave me!|
100211|Ahhh, it smells so gooood...!|
100212|(Meatballs from an otter? Gross! But just as you're about to put an end to this disgusting madness, Norv begins chowing down on the Fried Meatballs...)|
100213|Yes... yes!! Mmmn! Nothin' beats my sister's Fried Meatballs! My body's on FIRE! I feel alive again!|
100214|Ahh... thanks for a scrumptious meal! It's fine people like you that truly understand how wonderful my sister and her meatballs are.|
100215|Now, I'd love to stay and chat a while, but my presence is required at the Army Base. I must be off!|
100216|We can chat as much as you want if we ever meet again!|
100217|Would you like a Blessing Wristband? I feel as though we were destined to meet.|
100218|Here, let me fasten it for you.|
100219|There... now you will have the Grand Bishop's blessing.|
100220|Of course, his blessing doesn't come for free... there's a one-time blessing activation charge of 500 Gold.|
100221|Oh, come now! I'm sure 500 Gold is nothing to you!|
100222|From your outfit alone, I can tell you've a pretty penny in your pocket. So come on now, fork it over.|
100223|It would just be so sad if something horrible were to happen to you...|
100224|What? You refuse to pay? Hmph, it's high-time someone taught you a lesson then!|
100225|N-no, please stop!|
100226|The great man is he who does not hold a lesser man's faults against him. I also make a meager living...|
100227|I have an 80-year-old mother and seven brothers and sisters to feed at home... I had no other option...|
100228|Please, spare me! I promise never to do this again!|
100229|What utter nonsense! Sh-... she's right behind you!!|
100230|So... you followed me all the way to the village. You shall pay for this!|
100231|A spell like that will never work against me!|
100232|Wh-what?! The spell, it... it didn't do anything!|
100233|H-hah?!|
100234|Ahhh-!! H-help meeeee!|
100235|At last, you've returned! This is the Purity Powder I need, right?|
100236|Ah, I feel alive again!|
100237|I haven't felt like this since I was young!|
100238|I simply can't thank you enough. I could never have done this without you.|
100239|Wait, the color, it's... This isn't Purity Powder!|
100240|N-no! It's too late...|
100241|M-my body, it's... I-I'm...!!|
100242|Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-!!|
100243|Nooooooooooooooo!!|
100244|The Lucky Chinchilla is a fantastic creature, though finding it is the trick.|
100245|Legend says that merely shaking its paw will bring you years of good luck.|
100246|I'll cast a spell that might help in finding it.|
100247|...there... THERE! I see it!|
100248|Turbine Settlement... yes... in the northeast corner! Good luck, traveler!|
100249|Cobweb Forest... yes... in the northwest corner! Good luck, traveler!|
100250|Otter Marsh... yes... it is at the top of the waterfall! Good luck, traveler!|
100251|Ah, you are truly amazing! This is the Vitality Fruit and Holy Water I need! I should easily be able to start fortifying your weapons with this much.|
100252|First, use a Repair Hammer to restore the durability of the sword...|
100253|Then, forge the blade using Oriharagen to enhance its maximum durability...|
100254|Next, use Sage Stones and some World Tree Wood to upgrade the sword 20 times...|
100255|...sprinkle on Sprite Tears and Holy Water to enchant the sword 30 times...|
100256|...and inlay both a Dragon Magic Stone and a Rainbow Stone to add 40 new abilities.|
100257|Finally, top it all off with a Blessing Fortification Scroll to enhance the sword 9,999 times. Now, use the Vitality Fruit to prevent the enhancement from failing or burning out...|
100258|Ah, and one last thing... Inlay the sword with 5 Magical Tenjin Crystals.|
100259|There... it's finished! Your new sword.|
100260|What? You haven't even started using the Repair Hammer to restore its durability? This sword is completely different from the Vicious Beast Sword I gave you before...|
100261|No... this isn't the Vicious Beast Sword at all! I shall call it...|
100262|The one and only legendary, valiant, unrivaled, 5-diamond, victorious, precious sword of the brutal and ferocious, bloodsucking and deadly, Demon God of War +9999!!|
100263|Maybe I should work on shortening the name...|
100264|Oh! It's an Envoy of Gaia!|
100265|The Cube of Gaia may have great power, but I fear even that won't be enough...|
100266|Matters like this can't be left to weak demons.|
100267|What a waste of time. I'm out of here!|
100268|Oh! I nearly forgot all about you!|
100269|I'd love to hang out, but that'll have to wait.|
100270|Take your positions! Prepare for an ambush!|
100271|Ready... attack!!|
100272|Perfect, perfect... with their medical team demolished, there's nothing to stand in the way of our victory!|
100273|We could never have done this without you.|
100274|Treat yourself to a nice hot bath tonight, hm? Then get some sleep!|
100275|Ack! You gave me a scare there! Luckily for me, I have an extremely hardy disposition!|
100276|Phew! Time to kick back and relax!|
100277|I sure am lucky to have such great guys on my team!|
100278|Looks like I'll have time to scurry home and cook something up for the wife.|
100279|No rest for the wicked, as they say!|
100280|A-an impasse?!|
100281|No... I'll never surrender... never!|
100282|Almighty God, please... Hear the prayers of your humble servant...|
100283|I give my life unto you in order to vanquish this enemy!|
100284|(Sob... sob...)|
100285|Kill...! KILL!!|
100286|You despicable...|
100287|You're all going down, right here, right now!|
100288|BEEP! Investigating... lock...|
100289|Differentiate... scrap metal... no recyclable value...|
100290|Differentiate... scrap wood... no usable value...|
100291|Similar target... detected!|
100292|If it's the Marauder Granary you're looking for, that's in another direction. You wanna leave, come find me.|
100293|I'm the next shift.|
100294|Whoa... this sword!! Of course you can pass!|
100295|Good answer. They are with us. Here, take this. We'll need to go first.|
100296|Ah, you're finally here! Right this way.|
100297|Ugh, I feel soooo diiiiiizzy...|
100298|Whoa, you all right?|
100299|I-... I feel so... dizzy... my head's all... fuzzy-wuzzy... Maybe I was... hit by an... Entrancement Spore...?|
100300|What? How is that possible?! We all drank a Resistance Potion before we left.|
100301|Mmmn, but... I drank some water from... that bottle and now I... don't feel so good...|
100302|What?! That bottle contains slop samples!!|
100303|Ohhhh... my stomach... I'm gonna blow chunks...|
100304|I'm so hungrrrry...! When's Mom gonna wake up?|
100305|I don't knoooow... but hey! We can ask Mister and Missus Armor Mans for some food!|
100306|I miss Mom... *sniffle, sniffle...* Why won't she wake up?|
100307|There, there, don't cry! Missus Armor Lady will take care of you till she does. I miss Mom too... a lot! But I always tell myself not to cry!|
100308|O-... okay... I won't cry... we can both look out for each other!|
100309|Attaboy, Norry! Mom'll be so proud of you once she wakes up.|
100310|How dreadful, ugh! This whole place is just RIFE with monsters! We should get out of here as soon as possible!|
100311|But what about all the money we could get from these samples lying everywhere?|
100312|Is that all that matters to you? Money? What about your LIFE?!|
100313|What's life without money, am I right?|
100314|Ugh, you greedy pig! Stay here for all I care! I'M getting out of here! Ciao!|
100315|Wh-wh-whooooa! Don't leave me behiiiiiind!|
100316|See these mushrooms? They're magical! When they grow, they sparkle!|
100317|Who cares about that? All I know is that they make a primo snack!|
100318|What?! Y-you can't just... eat a bunch of rare, mysterious mushrooms that no one knows anything about!|
100319|Mmmn, but look at the way they glisten...|
100320|Yeah, and what if they're poisonous? D-d-dear god! Your stomach! It's... glowing!|
100321|W-what?! Where?! ...wait a minute... I don't see anything! What are you trying to pull?!|
100322|Ohohoho! Scared you, did I? Maybe you'll think twice about sticking something in that filthy mouth of yours next time!|
100323|D-did you see that? There was some kind of... of shadow!|
100324|D-d-do you think it was... g-ghosts?! Oh nooooo... I hate ghosts!!|
100325|Pish, we can't be afraid of ghosts! Ghosts don't even exist! They're just figments of our imagination. Worry not, there's no reason to be scared!|
100326|B-b-but there's a... a ghost... R-RIGHT BEHIND YOU!|
100327|What?! God almighty! Get away, get away, somebody save me, heeeeelp!!!|
100328|HA! What was that about not being afraid? You look like you're about to wet your pants!|
100329|W-well... that was the me of five seconds ago... much has changed in that time. Is it... is it gone yet?|
100330|It disappeared aaaages ago... geez! Why not just look for yourself?|
100331|My poor heart... ahhh, what do we do now? I-I wasn't prepared for this!|
100332|Well, we've been lucky so far. I don't know if there's anything else we can do.|
100333|Maybe... maybe we should go back to the Mushroom Village...|
100334|Yeah, but would we even make it? We're surrounded by monsters...|
100335|Don't say things like that! You'll just jinx things! We need to keep moving forward.|
100336|I just hope Mushroom Village receives our message and sends in reinforcements...|
100337|Ouch!!|
100338|Hm? You okay? Your wound hasn't opened back up, has it? Let me take a look...|
100339|N-no, it's just... I think the bandage is on too tight. It keeps pressing on the wound. Aren't you supposed to be better at this kind of thing?|
100340|S-sorry, I'll loosen it a little.
I've never bandaged someone before...|
100341|Y-yeowch!!|
100342|S-sorry!! Did I make it too tight again?|
100343|No, you idiot, you stepped on my foot!!|
100344|O-oh! I'm sorry...|
100345|Ugh, TRY to be a little more careful? At this rate, I'll be more full of holes than a jack-o-lantern!|
100346|Bwahaha!!|
100347|Are you allergic to something? Is it the spores in the air?|
100348|No, it's the perfume you're wearing! It's irritating my nose! Achoo!|
100349|What?! This is the latest mushroom perfume! Don't tell me you're allergic to it! What are you? Some ill-refined brute?|
100350|Whatever, just stay back, seriously! That smell is awful... Achoo!|
100351|No, YOU get back, you brutish troglodyte!|
100352|Isn't that the Colorful Winged Fairy that girl is always saying she wants?|
100353|It might be beautiful to look at, but it shouldn't be trifled with!|
100354|If I can't even catch up to it, how am I supposed to CATCH it?!|
100355|Better just catch an ordinary butterfly to give to the girl instead. That'll be both safe AND economical!|
100356|Oh! My beloved Romeo, why are there so many monsters around here?|
100357|Ah! My beautiful Juliet... it's because you are so alluring. It is not just I, but the whole world, that finds you irresistible.|
100358|But my view is obstructed by monsters, and I can't admire the scenery. What torment!|
100359|No matter, my beloved Juliet. Just gaze into my eyes, as I only have eyes for you...|
100360|Oh, my God! I'm such a fool! How could I have forgotten?|
100361|Juliet, in my eyes you are the most beautiful sight. Nothing can compare to you... I love you...|
100362|Oh... Romeo, you are the light of my life. I cannot live without you... I love you...|
100363|After I came to help, I discovered how humid it was here. Things get wet so easily...|
100364|Yes, and it's hard to get them dry. I wish there was a way to dry all this up.|
100365|What if we created an enormous heater? That way we could dry things out five times faster! Five times, I say!|
100366|Sounds great, but right now we can't spare the energy.|
100367|Sigh... Well, I guess we'll just have to shelve that idea for the time being. I really hope Lawrence can find an alternate energy source soon.|
100368|Wow! So many spiderwebs... ugh, what a horrible, sticky feeling...|
100369|Even so, these webs are quite something! I don't know how long it must've taken to weave something so huge.|
100370|I'd rather not know! I'd just as soon cut them down with a sword or burn the living hell out of them.|
100371|Come on, now! These are spiders' homes - if you burn them, where will they live?|
100372|In that case, I'll just burn the ones at the bottom that block the path.|
100373|Okay, fine - just don't burn the whole forest down!|
100374|It's amazing - these creatures are much stronger than I expected. You really have to see it to believe it.|
100375|Watch out - they're not just strong, they're extremely aggressive.|
100376|Do you think that if these otters were trained from a young age, they'd be well-behaved?|
100377|I don't know, but they'd probably make a mess of your furniture...|
100378|I'd give a few pieces of furniture to try it out! I'm sure with a bit of coaching, they'd be as sweet and darling as little lambs.|
100379|Studying the interaction between humans and domesticated otters would make a great research topic! Let me know if you're successful in taming them.|
100380|Oh, crap! How could the machine break down at such a critical moment?|
100381|What could the problem be? I don't know what these buttons are for... What the hell, I'll just press one and see what happens.|
100382|BEEP! BEEP! Recovery initiated, starting countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Shutdown confirmed.|
100383|What's going on? Automatic shutdown? Hit another key to continue.|
100384|BEEP! BEEP! Recovery successful, restarting...|
100385|Ah! I managed to fix it on my own. Sometimes I surprise myself. Hahaha!|
100386|Quite a view up here. I guess this is what it feels like to be tall!|
100387|I bet you can see any village from up here. What a feeling!|
100388|But if I look down, my head starts to spin... Does that mean I'm afraid of heights?|
100389|That's just dizziness, not a fear of heights. You're just not used to being so high up!|
100390|But I don't dare climb down... guess I'm scared of heights after all. Sorry I can't admire the view with you.|
100391|Don't worry - just close your eyes and hold onto my hand. I'll help you down.|
100392|Whew... thanks, you really are a good friend.|
100393|Alo, your wound looks serious. You should get it bandaged as soon as possible.|
100394|It's nothing... I can carry on fighting...|
100395|Don't try and be tough all the time... you need to take care of yourself! Besides, General Carrick wouldn't allow it.|
100396|But I can't just go back to camp while my brothers are still risking their lives in battle.|
100397|But I don't want to lose such a close friend. Don't be selfish! Think of how much I'd worry about you...|
100398|I guess I can understand... I'll return when I've recovered some of my strength.|
100399|You do just that! And I promise - I'll protect you with my life. I'll keep you safe while you return to camp!|
100400|I feel like the end is near...|
100401|Don't talk like that! There's still hope!|
100402|I feel sad for those who've died... and I'm afraid I'll never see my wife again...|
100403|Help is already on the way. Let's pull ourselves together, for the sake of our loved ones!|
100404|You're right - I just need to strengthen my resolve, and I'll be fine.|
100405|That's the spirit! There's no way we'll lose to such ugly monsters! We'll leave this place together... alive.|
100406|How could this have happened...? I'm so nervous for my son.|
100407|As am I for my husband... I'm scared he's already... sob...|
100408|We must have faith! I'm sure they're all right...|
100409|You're right - we must believe they'll return safe and sound.|
100410|Until they return, we must care for the injured. It'll help lighten the medics' load.|
100411|I want him to see me smiling when he returns home.|
100412|I just wanted to run a business - I didn't count on there being terrifying monsters all over the place.|
100413|What can we do? Do we have enough food and water?|
100414|I think so. I hope they find us soon... I don't want to be eaten!|
100415|Neither do I, boohoo... I want to go home! I miss my mother and father...|
100416|What are you whining about? Quit that racket or the monsters will find us for sure!|
100417|Boohoo... How can you be so mean at a time like this? So inconsiderate!|
100418|They're looking over here! Please, I beg you, stop crying...|
100419|Beloved Romeo, I dreamt of you last night... How fortunate that even in our dreams we are together...|
100420|Ah! My darling Juliet dreamt of me? I'm so happy, why, I could shout it from the rooftops!|
100421|But... Romeo, did I not appear in your dreams last night?|
100422|No, I was out as soon as my head hit the pillow. Next thing I knew it was morning!|
100423|What?! You don't love me enough to dream of me? Y-you're so awful!|
100424|No, Juliet! When I don't see you, I lose all hope. I'm so afraid of losing you...|
100425|I see... I was wrong to doubt you. I'll stay by your side. I'll never leave you...|
100426|Ah! As long as can gaze upon your beauty, there will be light in my life. I'm nothing without you, Juliet, my love...|
100427|Oh! As long as I'm protected by such a handsome and charming man, my life is complete. You are my everything, Romeo. I love you...|
100428|BEEP! Initiate exploration protocol. Start investigation.|
100429|Well done, Envoy of Gaia. The crisis has been averted! I'll give you what's left over.|
100430|Great job! You've worked hard, Envoy of Gaia.|
100431|Cough... Cough... Are you the guild that was sent to help us?|
100432|My army is embroiled in a bitter fight. I beseech you to go and help.|
100433|Cough... Cough...|
100434|Your wounds are grave... don't speak.|
100435|They're just ahead. Please, I'm begging you...|
100436|I'm begging you... Cough...|
100437|I didn't expect the enemy to be so strong... What should we do?|
100438|Foolish humans, like lambs to the slaughter!|
100439|Soldiers! Fire attack!|
100440|Yes, sir!|
100441|Burn... BURN! Kill them all!|
100442|What?!|
100443|Hurry back and report to the king!|
100444|The enemy is attacking! Protect the king!|
100445|Protect the king!|
100446|My king... It's them.|
100447|They've already defeated two generals.|
100448|They're stronger than we ever imagined...|
100449|Nonsense! No human is stronger than the Eldador army.|
100450|Right... Avenge the generals!|
100451|Formidable...|
100452|Damn! You can't even deal with a few shabby humans?|
100453|Everyone out! I'll deal with them myself.|
100454|Unforgivable...|
100455|Yes... destroy them!|
100456|At last, the Energy Furnace has been destroyed!|
100457|If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have had the strength to destroy the furnace.|
100458|Help! Stay away from me!|
100459|Someone... quick... Help!|
100460|Thank you! Things wouldn't have gone nearly this smooth without your help.|
100461|Now that the hostage has been rescued, we must be off. Farewell!|
100462|Bring it on!|
100463|You're gonna get more than you bargained for!|
100464|I, I...|
100465|Everyone out!|
100466|I'll deal with them myself.|
100467|My king, there's no need to...|
100468|What I say, goes! Everyone out!|
100469|It's... the king!|
100470|... Die, human!|
100471|We'll take care of the stragglers.|
100472|My king!|
100473|Envoys of Gaia, I am so grateful for your help.|
100474|It is wasn't for you...|
100475|This last battle may not have gone in our favor.|
100476|Thank you again for all your hard work!|
100477|Quiet! The king may be resting.|
100478|Notify the General... The Eldador General has been defeated by the humans.|
100479|Blast! How can this be?|
100480|Didn't you say the humans were outside?|
100481|Good, watch me tear them to pieces.|
100482|...|
100483|Blast... the king is dead.|
100484|Everyone, get out!|
100485|Escape through the back gate!|
100486|Things will be different with your help.|
100487|This is truly a great victory.|
100488|Huh?! You've come!|
100489|While you were away, we launched an attack. Odum and his soldiers are currently fighting those creatures.|
100490|First, I'll bring back some of the wounded. Then, I'll step in and help with the fight.|
100491|If you could come right away, it would be a great help. I think you should... go help Odum.|
100492|I'll come and help as soon as I've finished here.|
100493|I never expected this kind of monster!|
100494|Huh? You arrived in the nick of time. And Alex?|
100495|Eliminated!|
100496|Excellent! Continue the offensive!|
100497|Damn it! Here comes another one!|
100498|We'll deal with it. You're pretty quick on your feet. Hurry and find the Second Prince.|
100499|You Church lackeys are always foiling our plans! Especially you...|
100500|Blowing up Candeo Core's ancient water gate, killing Talen, and as for the obstructions at Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg...|
100501|It's true that people are deeply impressed by your skill. Naturally... there will be a reward. I'll give you a chance to fight.|
100502|But now I am tired of your despicable little tricks...|
100503|Older brother!|
100504|Is it the Winged Duke!? Surround him!|
100505|Blast... my power is still unstable, but...|
100506|Great... Envoy of Gaia, let's wait and see!|
100507|Something's not right! Everyone out of the way!|
100508|Ooh-ha!|
100509|Kwa!|
100510|Aaahh...|
100511|Though I was gravely injured, I was able to use advanced Black Magic to escape. Hmm...|
100512|Are you sure you're all right? You're not just putting on a brave face, are you?|
100513|I said, I'm fine...|
100514|Stop dawdling and get back to the pursuit... We have to kill the Winged Duke and the Charm Queen!|
100515|No... the Winged Duke is already severely injured. We also have the Envoy of Gaia... Let the Envoy and Alex give chase! I'll stay here and look after you.|
100516|We must look at the bigger picture, Odum! Anyway, I have no doubts that as long as I can rest awhile, I'll be able to catch up.|
100517|Very well - we'll commence our pursuit and you can catch up.|
100518|Let's go, then - we must take down the Winged Duke and the Charm Queen.|
100519|There's no time to lose - let's go! Catch up as soon as you can!|
100520|This feels...|
100521|It feels just like the time we chased the Charm Queen in the Haunted Passage...|
100522|And these foul insects again!|
100523|Charm Queen! You've finally shown yourself.|
100524|Didn't you see the Winged Duke? We must be careful...|
100525|What shall we do? Naturally, I'd like you to live a bit longer...|
100526|But what good have you done?|
100527|Bwahaha!! Don't blame me, it serves you right!|
100528|Ugh... y-you... you're more formidable than people think...|
100529|Where is the Winged Duke? Talk!|
100530|Older brother? Are you feeling better?|
100531|Huh? It's the Second Prince! Have you recovered?|
100532|I'm much better, thank you... but I'm not used to being away from battle for so long.|
100533|Let me at her! I'll make that succubus tell us where the Winged Duke is!|
100534|Older brother... I can see from the expression on your face that you won't be swayed.|
100535|Haha! You know me too well, little brother.|
100536|Second Prince, please be careful... I don't know what the Charm Queen is playing at.|
100537|No... cough... I have nothing to say....|
100538|Really? You still have time to reconsider... As in, the time it takes for me to walk over there...|
100539|Ah! Awaydas! Where are you... cough... hurry and save me!|
100540|It's the sound of the Winged Duke!|
100541|Everyone, look out!|
100542|Winged Duke! Stop hiding in the dark, and show yourself!|
100543|Yes... If it isn't my good Duke... My good Awa-|
100544|NO! My strength... Aaahh!|
100545|No... Awa... You... you can't...!|
100546|Older brother!|
100547|This...|
100548|Naturally, I won't allow you to die at the hands of villains. Now your strength, along with that of the Second Prince, will feed me... making me even more powerful.|
100549|Don't you see? Victory or defeat is of no great importance. Those that live longest become strongest.|
100550|Hmm...|
100551|This pressure...|
100552|Accept the taste of defeat. But if you return to see me harboring regret and hatred... I will annihilate you!|
100553|Older brother...|
100554|O... Odum?|
100555|Sigh... I never could have imagined something like this would happen...|
100556|I'll stay here with Odum. There are still some things I need to convey to the Templars at the entrance.|
100557|First, make your way back to Navea and inform the Grand Bishop of the recent events...|
100558|Hmph, you think you can hurt me?|
100559|The Glyphed Shackles! How can it be?|
100560|Think a mere rune can defeat me? How naive...|
100561|My magic will tear you apart! Die!|
100562|According to the position shown on the detector, it should be here.|
100563|Here we are!|
100564|Wait, wait... Something strange is going on with the detector!|
100565|This oppressive feeling... Monsters! Demons are emerging from the Dimensional Fissure! Watch out!|
100566|Wow! Defeating those demons was a piece of cake! But unless we can think of a way to seal them in, they'll keep coming...|
100567|We should return at once and notify the Templars of the location of the Dimensional Fissure.|
100568|Maybe the Grand Bishop's Mage can come up with a way to seal it.|
100569|So let's....|
100570|Ah, you've caught up. Leave the Dimensional Fissure to me.|
100571|The Dimensional Fissure has been sealed. Great work!|
100572|Excellent! Now the demons are sealed in for good.|
100573|Anyway... here, take this sword.|
100574|This sword... it's unbelievable! It seems to be surging with endless power. I'll find some way to pay you for it!|
100575|Think of it as fate... I'll make an exception this time and not ask anything for it. Ah... I've been here far too long - I must be off!|
100576|Wait, wait... I can't take this sword for nothing. Please don't go, hold on!|
100577|She's still learning, but let her accompany you.|
100578|Is it nearby? Hold on... I'll activate the detector.|
100579|Prepare to die! Foolish humans!|
100580|What... what's that?|
100581|Ah, sweet, sweet freedom...|
100582|Are you okay?|
100583|Cough, cough... it's nothing...|
100584|It's just that the spell has been removed, and I'm still getting used to it...|
100585|No! Don't run!|
100586|Cough...|
100587|Curses! He's still in shock from the spell and you're letting him leave!|
100588|According to the map, the Cadilla Felwood is not far from here. It's easy to get disoriented - this place is like a maze.|
100589|Ahead of us, the road forks in three directions, one of which leads to a portal.|
100590|I seem to recall there being a large fruit tree growing near the portal.|
100591|Shall we take the left fork? Come on, let's give it a shot.|
100592|This tree is pretty small... not at all like the large one you said you remembered.|
100593|This tree doesn't seem to be the right color. It's nothing like the one I remember.|
100594|I could be wrong, though - let's keep going.|
100595|Unfortunately for us, the demon camp is protected by a magical barrier of black mist!|
100596|We should go back where we started and keep on searching.|
100597|Shall we take the right fork? Come on, let's give it a shot.|
100598|This place looks very familiar! Come on, let's hurry.|
100599|Puckett, is that the tree you mentioned?|
100600|Yes! That's it! The portal should be close... I'll look around.|
100601|The portal is open! Quick, go through it while there are no enemies nearby!|
100602|As far as I can make out, the black mist is controlled by crystals. We can't force our way through.|
100603|Of course! The crystals are controlled by a mechanism.|
100604|I managed to sneak a peek just now. I couldn't make it out too clearly, but I think the mechanism is a tablet.|
100605|If it is the mechanism, we need to open it and take a look.|
100606|Agh! Help, help! It's a Frenzied Ogre trap!|
100607|Envoy of Gaia, deal with the Frenzied Ogres. Puckett, come with me.|
100608|Phew... that was close! Huh? There's a mechanism here that looks like a tablet...|
100609|Open it and see! This could be our chance.|
100610|Shall we take the middle fork? Come on, let's give it a shot.|
100611|I'll protect Puckett!|
100612|Envoy of Gaia, I'm so happy you're here to help!|
100613|Generals Carrick and Victoria have assembled a crack team of commandos to raid the heart of the Felwood!|
100614|Please catch up to them and offer your support. We'll stay here and defend the camp. Good luck!|
100615|These insects dare disturb my sleep thinking they can control me?|
100616|We present our own blood as an offering. Awaken and do our bidding... Awaken!|
100617|Strange, where is everyone? And why are there no guards?|
100618|This is terrible... Someone's forgotten to feed the spiders again... Ah!|
100619|Hmm... Seems like we'll have to fight our way through!|
100620|You! Did the Grand Bishop send you here to help me? Hold on - something's moving up ahead!|
100621|I have an uncomfortable feeling again. Do you feel it?|
100622|According to the map, we should reach the Cadilla Felwood soon. Let's get going.|
100623|The sealed area is up ahead. It looks like there are no monsters this time...|
100624|I'm ready... Let me do it!|
100625|This would have been a pretty tough battle without you!|
100626|Let's go! We'll have to fight our way in!|
100627|Hmm... Let's see. This Karok Totem should hold the secret to opening the portal.|
100628|Transport some magic power here, then open up the three nodes. That should do the trick!|
100629|Help! I'm just a smuggler! I don't want to die in this place.|
100630|Done! This should teleport us right to the Demon Gluttons!|
100631|That's strange... There's no trace of the Demon Gluttons. Be careful, there may be something fishy going on...|
100632|So, you were able to corner me after all. Well, I'll just have to take you all to hell with me!|
100633|Hahahaha! Foolish woman! Sacrificing yourself to save others!|
100634|It gives me such joy to witness the foolhardy actions of pitiful humans!|
100635|Don't look at me like that! I'll send you to join her in the next life!|
100636|At last, the seal is removed. Let's go.|
100637|Hehe! You won't blame me, will you? Thanks so much for your help!|
100638|Let's seize the opportunity and fight our way in!|
100639|Take him by surprise!|
100640|Hmph! Won't we be defenseless?|
100641|I feel like this headstrong charge might get us killed...|
100642|Hahaha... I never thought it would be so easy to trap you!|
100643|Surround them! Don't let anyone escape.|
100644|You despicable...|
100645|I can't moveK|
100646|Release us!|
100647|This fog... what's going on?|
100648|Don't let them get away!|
100649|Go help Alex and his brother. I'll stay here a while and recover, then catch up...|
100650|After I was captured, I saw the Charm Queen head even deeper into that place...|
100651|We injured the Winged Duke pretty badly - he'll definitely find a way to rendezvous with the Charm Queen. If you can get here quickly, you may be able to kill two birds with one stone.|
100652|The Charm Queen is shrewd and cunning... I think my young brother could use the help of a strong character like you.|
100653|You're urging me to go? Very well... I need all the encouragement I can get at times like these.|
100654|You're wasting valuable time...|
100655|You may have beaten me before in the Leyline Arena, but if you don't stop wasting time you'll regret it!|
100656|What a strange place... I rushed in and saw a group of mages gathered around some sort of mushroom... Then, one by one, everyone turned into mushrooms...|
100657|No! You've transformed into a mushroom!|
100658|Stay where you are! Don't come near me!|
100659|Found it! If I remember correctly, the portal should open like this...|
100660|Whew! We got in without any trouble. I expected we'd catch them off guard, but I didn't expect an ambush.|
100661|Luckily, Victoria's powerful defense magic protected us.|
100662|Why is it so quiet? Could it be...?|
100663|Look!|
100664|After that, she entered the Felwood alone. I figured she was going to kill the Demon Gluttons by herself...|
100665|Envoy of Gaia, please go and help her as soon as possible.|
100666|...|
100667|I feel terrible... You had to face the Demon Gluttons all by yourself!|
100668|After pushing you, I managed to escape from that giant rock by the skin of my teeth.|
100669|Both you and the Demon Gluttons assumed I was dead.|
100670|So I beat you at your own game, waiting for the perfect time to launch a surprise attack.|
100671|Uhh... my head... Demon Gluttons... Shadow Knight... uhh...|
100672|Wahaha! You've fallen into my trap. Die!|
100673|The portal isn't here.|
100674|It's not here either.|
100675|Quick, open this mechanism.|
100676|Come on, they've been waiting for you for ages!|
100677|No... how... this is not in the script!|
100678|Curses! The enemy is attacking! I must hurry and awaken the Sickle Spiderling!|
100679|How dare these bugs cause trouble? They only have strength in numbers!|
100680|How many do you need? Perhaps I'll summon a few of Gluttony's Slaves to keep you company!|
100681|I'll show you just how terrifying my Demon Gluttons are!|
100682|Don't even think of escaping. You'll never leave this place!|
100683|We're heading north to where the Winged Duke dwells according to the scout's report.|
100684|Shut up, you Makar brat! I will dispatch you to meet your brother in Pandemonium!|
100685|The moment has finally come... There is no escape for the Winged Duke this time!|
100686|The three of us will take care of the front lines using the same formation as when we confronted the Charm Queen last time.|
100687|The rest of you please take up the rear guard.|
100688|We have to hold the line at all costs! Don't let any monsters penetrate the front lines.|
100689|Yes, sir! We will fight to the death to protect the rear guard!|
100690|You bastards again! How dare you rain on my parade again?! I will have my revenge for your actions at Titan's Root.|
100691|Well at least this saves me the trouble of searching for you...|
100692|This ends now: you're going to die here!|
100693|Hmph! Wrong! It's you who is going to die!|
100694|You're a feisty one, aren't you? I can't wait to kill you with my own hands!|
100695|Let me show you what I'm really made of!|
100696|You despicable... No, it can't be...|
100697|Give me your power... Starting with that silly saber of yours! Hahahaha!|
100698|(This is despicable... It's no use fighting them. I'd better retreat while I still can...)|
100699|Release him!|
100700|Death to the Winged Duke!|
100701|Harrumpf... I'm letting you go this time. Praise the Gods that you may live to see another day!|
100702|I've been waiting for you for a long time. Thank you for removing my curse.|
100703|It's strange, though... why do I still look like this?|
100704|I don't quite know how to answer... it seems removing the curse requires one final step. Are you willing to help me?|
100705|I really don't enjoy looking like a disgusting toad...|
100706|Thank you for helping me destroy the totem. As for the remaining curse, I'll think of a way...|
100707|Is this my hand? I haven't seen my own slender hands in so long.|
100708|Yes, these are the Orb Fragments I was looking for. At last, I can summon the demonic spirits, mwuahaha!!|
100709|You still don't know what's going on? My mother didn't give me any orbs.|
100710|I'm actually a squad leader, but one day I met a strange man who changed me into this pitiful shape.|
100711|Thanks to you, I was able to remove the curse. Thank you!|
100712|This is an orb for summoning the demonic spirits, an orb that grants you a wish! That's how you should use it.|
100713|Was it you that summoned me?|
100714|Hey... are you a demonic spirit? Why do you look so weak?|
100715|How dare you insult me like that! ...Well, I'll let it slide this time since you freed me from the orb.|
100716|A wish? Sure, I'm listening...|
100717|I never imagined a lesser demon could be so reasonable.|
100718|I want to become the most powerful mage! The most powerful mage in the world!|
100719|Hahaha! The world's most powerful mage? That's a great dream... But I must go. Farewell!|
100720|Wait! Waaait! You aren't granting my wish? How can you just leave like this?|
100721|Huh? Did I say I'd grant your wish? No, I just said I'd listen!|
100722|Hahaha! If you really want to change, do it on your own! Foolish human.|
100723|I... I won't give up. There must be something in this world that can help me realize my wish...|
100724|That's it! Collect five Dragon Orbs! With five Dragon Orbs I can summon the ancient dragon deity!|
100725|He loves me...|
100726|He loves me not...|
100727|What? I'm out of petals? That's not right... better keep trying.|
100728|Human! I can sense that you are a kind-hearted soul. Could you do me a favor and calm her down?|
100729|Why are you damaging the flowers like that?|
100730|Please, calm yourself! I mean you no harm.|
100731|Ah! Monster! Where'd it come from?|
100732|Wait! W-wait, I'm not here to hurt you!|
100733|I won't submit to a monster like you!|
100734|Why... why would you help a monster? You're human, aren't you?|
100735|(You sheathe your weapon and look at her.)|
100736|Thank you, human. There's something I want to say to you...|
100737|Cursed human, making me stoop to this!|
100738|That sword in the stone south of the Silverflash Tribe, I can't pull it out for the life of me!|
100739|There must be some way to do it. If I have that sword, no one will be able to kill me. Hahahaha!|
100740|What?! I, the invincible... wounded...|
100741|The sword! So... you managed to pull the sword from the stone!|
100742|Damn! Damn! You despicable human! I won't let you get away with this!|
100743|Human, is there something you want from me?|
100744|(You tell the Yeti about Buzz.)|
100745|I didn't expect you'd understand what I was saying... how interesting! Haha... You want me to practice with the boy? Sounds fun! Take me to him...|
100746|Wow! I never thought I'd be practicing with a Yeti. How fantastic!|
100747|Seems to be an energetic boy, my blood is pumping hard!|
100748|Mr. Yeti, can you please stand on the other side and catch the ball when I throw it, then throw it back to me?|
100749|Okay, I'm ready. Let's see what you've got!|
100750|Terrific! I haven't had this much fun in ages! Here it comes...|
100751|Watch this! Meteor SHOT!!|
100752|Whoa! You're impressive! That was an awesome throw!|
100753|Finally! Finally! Someone who can really play ball! I'm so happy! Will you be my friend, Mr. Yeti? Hahaha!|
100754|What is this Banner? What happened?! I am swelling with power! I am fearless now, it doesn't matter how many monsters there are!|
100755|Yeeeesssssssss! I feel as if I have infinite power. Guys, let's fight!|
100756|Holy Light! See those weaklings up ahead?|
100757|Charge! Destroy them!|
100758|The power of Navea!|
100759|For the Grand Bishop!|
100760|This is the apple of transformation? Thank you for finding one for me!|
100761|(Jonissa happily grabs the apple and takes a bite out of it.)|
100762|You can hardly believe what happens next.|
100763|Hmm... Please don't be afraid. It's the effect of the apple that made me look like this.|
100764|How could you desecrate a sacred image like that? Unforgivable!|
100765|I can't believe you actually beat me... Curses!|
100766|Thanks to that, I managed to make some special new friends.|
100767|Speaking of which, it's almost time for me to meet up with my friends! I have to go now.|
100768|Thank you very much for bringing me the apple. I'm meeting my friends near the bridge. You're always welcome to join us if you feel like it.|
100769|It was so kind of you to remember me. Thanks for bringing me the energy tonic.|
100770|Wow, I feel much better now. The person who made this tonic must be a genius!|
100771|I've spent too much time here because of my wounds. I have to leave now. Thank you, my friend.|
100772|You solved the mystery. Congratulations, bold adventure!|
100773|I am Krane, the great magician who set up this slate.|
100774|I am currently traveling the realm, and what you hear now is merely a recording. I was hoping you could solve a riddle that's been plaguing me for some time. I look forward to it.|
100775|Bluebird! You're back! I missed you so much!|
100776|Achoo!|
100777|I have no idea what I would've done if you never returned. Thank you!|
100778|My dear Bluebird, it's so good to have you back!|
100779|Are you afraid? I won't leave you alone, I promise!|
100782|It is impressive that a rabble of insects like you were able to reach this far. I shall await you in the depths.|
100783|Those of you who do not come, prepare to bury those foolish enough to do so. Do not disappoint me, insects.|
100784|What are you vile Envoys of Gaia doing here? As soon as you showed up, there was an awful stench.|
100785|I will not let you pass. Now be good and let me burn you to ashes!|
100786|Envoys of Gaia, I never imagined you would come to face me! Hahahaha!|
100787|The time for my glory has finally arrived! I will bury you here!|
100788|So you have finally come? My feeble minions delayed you for so long. You truly are pathetic.|
100789|Even so, the fact that you are still standing is worthy of praise.|
100790|Are all of you prepared for the chaos of Pandemonium?|
100791|Interesting, quite interesting indeed... I'll show you the true meaning of fear!|
100792|So it's you. I'm busy here. Don't ruin my productivity.|
100793|General! Hmph, at a time like this... Whatever, I'll return with you.|
100794|Insects, I will allow you to live a little while longer. Next time we meet, I will send you to your deaths.|
100795|If you want to save the foolish adventurers inside, make sure you don't allow yourselves to be slain at the head of my axe before too long.|
100796|Why is there a monster like this here?! I don't want to die! Somebody save me!|
100797|Roar!|
100799|They're so vicious; we can't hold them back...|
100800|What can we do?|
100801|My king?|
100802|Oh yes! Find the king!|
100803|Find the king! Find the king!|
100804|What should I do?|
100805|Chant the king's spell!|
100806|Chant, chant!|

100836|Sigh... we have failed once again. The Winged Duke managed to escape.|
100837|Avenge the Second Prince!|
100838|You think you can defeat me? How naive of me!|
100951|...|
101056|...|
101123|Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Don't be shy! Get your Grilled Tentacle now while it's crispy and tender!|
101124|Daddy, will you buy me one?!|
101125|No way! But I just bought you some Cotton Candy...|
101126|Look! What a cute little Snow Sprite!|
101127|Yes, it certainly is. Will you catch one for me, brother? I'd love to have one for myself...|
101128|There is no place of peace these days, no rest for the weary. It's really a hard business to run.|
101129|I agree... seeing how no place is safe, I'm thinking of returning to my village.|
101130|Check out these delicious Festive Noodles! Now only one Festive Coin!|
101131|Sigh...|
101132|Whatever, man. Let's change the subject. By the way, where's our food?|
101133|I'm afraid the Fried Noodles have not yet come. I'm starving!|
101134|I am granting you my remaining powers. You must defeat him.|
101135|Fret not. Someone will come to save you.|
101136|You are the hope of this world. You're the Scion of Fate.|
101137|Grand Bishop: Cease this, Reinhardt.|
101138|Grand Bishop: How many more lives do you want to take away just to satisfy your selfish needs?|
101139|Grand Bishop: Let Luciana rest in peace. God will lead her to another world...|
101140|Shadow Knight: Shut up! You have no right to talk to me about her!|
101141|Shadow Knight: You gave excuses to avoid helping her when she needed help the most, leaving her to die.|
101142|Shadow Knight: You're the one who's responsible, and you still can still be "your holiness." You make me sick!|
101143|Grand Bishop: ...|
101144|Shadow Knight: Yes? Nothing to say?|
101145|Shadow Knight: Whether you admit it or not, it has no significance to me.|
101146|Shadow Knight: After all, I am about to destroy this hypocritical world!|
101147|Grand Bishop: I can't allow you to make any more mistakes, Reinhardt.|
101148|Shadow Knight: Are you holding... Medicine of the Holy Spirit?! Don't tell me...|
101149|Grand Bishop: It looks like the time has come to finally use this Medicine!|
101150|Shadow Knight: Stop it! You had better stop this!|
101151|Shadow Knight: Belenus!!!|
101152|Shadow Knight: How dare you apply the Medicine of the Holy Spirit!?|
101153|Shadow Knight: I begged for that once... Don't tell me that Luciana's life isn't worth saving compared to this brat's?|
101154|Grand Bishop: I've never done anything worth regretting, except perhaps not being in time to stop you from...|
101155|Shadow Knight: Save your breath. I'm gonna kill you now! You shall perish together with this old world!|
101156|Shadow Knight: Why? Isn't that familiar scent... Luciana's?|
101157|Shadow Knight: How did you get her power? Where is she?|
101158|Shadow Knight: Well, no matter whose power you possess, you will never beat me.|
101159|This should be a good place to fight without any interruption. We shall battle here.|
101160|Using Luciana's scent to make me waver? I can't forget it! If she's still alive, I will know that one step ahead of you!|
101161|Come on! I shall let you experience death once more after this match!|
101162|Shadow Knight: No... How can that be? How could I lose to you...|
101163|Shadow Knight: I will not give up, Luciana...|
101164|Shadow Knight: Luciana... It's you...|
101165|Luciana: I have always been by your side, but you couldn't feel my presence due to being blinded by anger and anguish.|
101166|Shadow Knight: I...|
101167|Luciana: Let's go, before you commit an irreparable sin...|
101168|Shadow Knight: Luciana... I am content now, because I got to see you again.|
101169|Grand Bishop: Looks like we're too late... The Pandemonium Rift is open.|
101170|Andre: Grand Bishop... are you planning to...|
101171|Grand Bishop: Yes, Andre. I will stay here to guard the Rift.|
101172|Grand Bishop: This is the only way to prevent a demon incursion, thereby saving everyone.|
101173|Andre: I see. I will respect your decision.|
101174|Grand Bishop: As the Grand Bishop, this is my duty, so please don't get upset.|
101175|Grand Bishop: You shall take charge of the Templars, Andre.|
101176|Andre: Yes. We will do our very best to protect everyone.|
101177|Grand Bishop: Guardians who have defeated the Shadow Knight, come here... I would like to talk to all of you.|
101178|Frozen Sorcerer: Ha! You can forget catching me with those petty skills of yours.|
101179|Frozen Sorcerer: I am Von, the True-Blue Dragon, and all of your skills together could never match mine.|
101180|Frozen Sorcerer: Yes, Master.|
101181|The Templars have been defeated, and now the Grand Bishop faces the Shadow Knight.|
101182|You watch, helpless, as the Grand Bishop confronts the Shadow Knight alone.|
101183|The Medicine of the Holy Spirit shines brightly, and the Holy Light flows towards the people on the ground, healing them.|
101184|Your strength is slowly returning, and you're able to move your arms and legs.|
101185|The Shadow Knight jumps and dashes angrily towards the Grand Bishop, wielding his sword.|
101186|All of a sudden, a mysterious energy surges through your body. You get to your feet and block the attack intended for the Grand Bishop.|
101187|You stare down the Shadow Knight, ready to destroy him.|
101188|After finishing his sentence, he uses black magic again, producing a turbulent wave of energy.|
101189|???: "My dear husband, I have always been by your side."|
101190|A gentle voice speaks, suffused with love and warmth.|
101191|Luciana spreads her wings and advances toward the Shadow Knight.|
101192|She turns to you, offering an appreciative bow.|
101193|She approaches the Shadow Knight, and a powerful Magic Circle appears beneath her feet.|
101194|As the Magic Circle vanishes, Luciana and the Shadow Knight disappear.|
101195|After saying so, the Frozen Sorcerer drains power from the three Dragon Tyrants.|
101196|The powers of the three Dragon Tyrants merge together, forming new energy.|
101197|In the end, the energy generated by these powers flows upward, creating a rift in the sky...|
101198|Inside the cave, the air is not only freezing, but heavy with power.|
101199|An ice-cold voice that seems to come from the depths of Pandemonium can be heard.|
101200|???: The Shadow Knight has lost. I want you to open a new gate to Pandemonium as soon as possible.|
101201|???: The biggest troops need a more stable passageway to Terra.|
101202|The Pandemonium Rift is still emitting power, as if something within wants to come out.|
101203|Standing before the rift, the Grand Bishop begins to cast a spell.|
101204|A vast Magic Circle filled with holy power appears, encompassing the rift.|
101205|The Magic Circle temporarily halts the progress of the emerging evil energy.|
101206|Suddenly, space begins to twist, and an enormous force pulls you towards the Rift.|
101207|Grand Bishop: Reinhardt... You...|
101208|Shadow Knight: Hahahaha! I changed my mind. I'll settle my score with you first, savior...|
101209|Shadow Knight: I shall let you see what despair tastes like, Belenus.|
101210|Frozen Sorcerer: Well, I shall dedicate all of your remaining power to the new world!|
100839|How... how did I let you trick me again?|
100840|He got away again. At least you didn't get trapped in his nefarious scheme.|
100841|I'll let you taste my fury!|
100842|Now, I will take your power. Hahaha!|
100843|No... Let me go.|
100844|No, I don't want to die. Let me go.|
100845|Ahh...|
100846|You filthy... I'll make you pay. Cough....cough...|
100847|Hahaha! You can't even move, but you're still talking big?|
100848|Blast it! Pull yourself together, father.|
100849|(I need to find a way to stall for time and get out of these restraints.)|
100850|Winged Duke, come try me if you have the guts! Leave the others alone.|
100851|Hahaha! I'm only joking. I will take power from all of you. Do not resist!|
100852|Now it's your father's turn. I will send him to join your brothers.|
100853|I won't let you hurt my father.|
100854|How could you have had such power?|
100855|This is perfect. Let me take every last drop. Hahaha!|
100856|Don't think I'll let you win.|
100857|You're just in time.|
100858|I'll go take care of the Winged Duke. You hurry and save my father and the others.|
100859|Damn, stop getting in my way.|
100860|I'll let you go this time, but the next time I see you all, I WILL have your power. Ha ha ha!|
100861|I'm so grateful for your help.|
100862|The Winged Duke got away again. I really hate his guts...|
100863|If you rush after him now, you might end up in the enemy's trap.|
100864|You should proceed with caution.|
100865|The most important thing right now is getting the wounded back to base.|
100866|We can go after the Winged Duke again after we regroup.|
100867|So, you managed to find this place. Oh, so eager to come and play!|
100868|Since you've found my kingdom, allow me give you a fitting reception!|
100869|Unfortunately, I have some other matters to attend to. I'll let my pets keep you company for now!|
100870|Come! Guzigla!|
100871|I await your arrival with bated breath. If you make it here alive, that is!|
100872|There you are.|
100873|We've already mounted several assaults on these Demon Armies.|
100874|I'm fairly sure the Shadow Knight is somewhere in the depths. He's much more powerful than he was when he invaded the audience hall...|
100875|Wow! We almost had him!|
100876|The Frozenlea Plains are Von's territory. They're bound to be full of traps.|
100877|Hurry and support the commander.|
100878|Hmm... This is Klaus' handwriting...|
100879|Klaus was right... There is something more important than the honor of the Silverflash Tribe...|
100880|I am ready to accept retribution for my mistake!|
100881|Stop messing around! How could you surrender this easily!?|
100882|Watch and learn! You're going to die here!|
100883|Are you all okay?|
100884|Are you okay?|
100885|Damn!|
100886|Ahhhhhh!|
100887|Von! We said we'd meet again!|
100888|Yaaahh--!!|
100889|This won't be the only price you're going to pay for what you've done! Not by far!|
100890|I'm about to hand it to you.|
100891|Keep moving forward. The Shadow Knight is somewhere in the depths. We have to stop him!|
100892|You again?! I am sick and tired of your persistence.|
100893|Stop! There is no coming back from the dead. Doing this will cause but more death.|
100894| Hmph! Andre, you're still so naive. You don't understand. Now, give me all you got!|
100895|Please take Luciana somewhere safe. I'll stall them.|
100896|Take care, Maggie.|
100897|Let's go! We've gotta stop the Shadow Knight!|
100898|Arrghhhh!|
100899|I shall give you the power to save them!|
100900|Winged Duke! Show yourself!|
100901|Stop! What're you doing here?|
100902|I'll claw out your trachea, scum!|
100903|Don't think you're getting out of here alive!|
100904|Huh? If it isn't Klaus!|
100905|And so SKILLED, yes? Someone's been diligent in their training.|
100906|But alas, it won't be enough. Consider it an honor to fall before me...|
100907|Or are you going to run away again, just like the little dog you are?! Hahaha!|
100908| Hmph! You'll pay for what you've done here! Prepare to die, traitor!|
100909|Not even those of great strength can resist the lure of power and prestige.|
100910|Perhaps, now, those that suffered thanks to his tyranny will be able to rest in peace...|
100911|Thank god! Now I can carry on with my figh!|
100912|Okay then, let's go.|
100913|Thanks! I thought I was a goner!|
100914|You came just in time! Great timing, really!|
100915|Thanks for your help. I hope everything goes well for you!|
100916|That was a dangerous situation just now. Thanks for your help!|
100917|Thanks for your help. That was a hairy situation!|
100918|Where are you from, human? You dare trespass here?!|
100919|Human? Blast you!|
100920|Huh? Is this the... Immobilization Rune?!|
100921|You dare stand in my way? I'll crush your ribs and drink your spinal fluid! Go to hell!|
100922|You cur! I'm not going to give you a chance to escape!|
100923|I've destroyed the Totem. The path is open now.|
100924|I've converted the Totem's magic energy into speed energy.|
100925|Let me give you a helping hand!|
100926|Let us handle Von. We have some personal grudges to resolve.|
100927|Evil shall not prevail!|
100928|I won't let you get in the Shadow Knight's way!|
100929|Watch out!|
100930|It's crucial that Luciana be resurrected right now. I don't have time to deal with you!|
100931|You! The Shadow Knight got away again!|
100932|You've done so many evil things! I can't allow you to get away with it all!|
100933|Hmm... That's much better...|
100934|Of course. Before fighting the Shadow Knight, we first have to defeat the Frozen Sorcerer, who's protecting him. He, too, is a formidable adversary.|
100935|All right. I'll lead the troops out of here. You catch up later.|
100936|I'm so hungry... This meat is taking ages to cook.|
100937|I really want to eat some game, but I'll have to wait. Minding this pigpen is so boring.|
100938|Come here and die! Foolish creature!|
100939|Von! Where are you hiding?!|
100940|Enough of your nonsense! I'll kill you where you stand!|
100941|I'm injured!|
100942|We're friendlies!|
100943|We're on your side! Cease fire! Cease fire!!!|
100944|I can't take this, I just can't take it!|
100945|I've been poisoned! I've been poisoned!|
100946|I'm dying... I'm dying!|
100947|Medic! Hurry!|
100948|We're on your side. Stop attacking!|
100949|Medic! I'm bleeding!|
100950|What are you doing?|
100952|An announcement! Conduct your injury spell training!|
100953|Rest up when you have to. If you keep on yapping, I'll injure you for real.|
100954|...|
100955|Our unit is going to move out soon.|
100956|Can you stay and keep me company for a while?|
100957|Captain, I'll stay here until the very end. Be careful when you move out.|
100958|Don't worry! I'll be fine.|
100959|When you come back, let's get married! We can go back to Crescent Hill, open a restaurant, and live a simple life.|
100960|Captain, whatever happens, I'll wait for your return! Be careful. Don't let those monsters hurt you.|
100961|What do you want to do after the war? I want to go back home and take her to see a windmill.|
100962|You said your home is on Helonia Coast, right? Forget windmills. I prefer watching the girls play in the sea!|
100963|What's the deal with this conversation? Isn't it too early to talk about all of this?|
100964|When the war's over, I want to be an adventurer. I'll be happy as long as I can meet a bunch of pretty girls!|
100965|That's a strange reason. How would an adventurer meet a bunch of pretty girls?|
100966|Meiya, what do you want to do after the war?|
100967|Well... I want to find a nice man to marry, and become a mother.|
100968|No way! I can't see that happening!|
100969|Yeah, no way that's gonna happen!|
100970|Aren't you two bored of this life?|
100971|We've been ordered to come here and protect the people who come to fish.|
100972|But nobody's got time to go fishing in the middle of this war.|
100973|You're wrong there. People don't just go fishing to relax, but to train their body and mind as well. It's more important now than ever to go fishing.|
100974|Getting back on topic... I heard you volunteered to be sent here. Why?|
100975|You two must be tired after standing for so long. I've got some drinks here. How about taking a break?|
100976|We're fine. This is our mission. Don't worry. But if you insist, I'll take a quick break.|
100977|Ah, I know why...|
100978|What can we do? We've lost our home...|
100979|Why would they treat us like this?|
100980|Fire! So much fire! So many monsters!|
100981|(Sob... sob...)|
100982|Where should we go now?|
100983|There are monsters everywhere. There's nowhere to go...|
100984|We could find someone to help?|
100985|No, humans are so scary!|
100986|(Sob... sob...)|
100987|Siri, we have to rendezvous with the others soon. What are you doing?|
100988|I'm counting how much money I've got in my piggy bank.|
100989|In your piggy bank? Do you want to buy something?|
100990|If you're planning on buying something from the Mysterious Merchant, forget about it. You can't buy the sorts of things he sells with loose change.|
100991|It's not that. I want to donate money to the war victims.|
100992|The Supply Squad Leader will be leaving soon, so I want to ask him to take it with him.|
100993|You're so kind. It's not like you're rich. Why do still want to donate what little you have?|
100994|So many people have lost the things most precious to them in this war. I just want to do something for them.|
100995|You really are too kind. It's nearly time to rendezvous with the others. I'll count the money with you!|
100996|Really? Thank you!|
100997|Hurry up! It's not safe here. Get a move on!|
100998|Why are we collecting weapons here?|
100999|The fighting is too intense. We need to replenish our current supplies any way we can before the next shipment.|
101000|Aren't any weapons we get here going to be junk?|
101001|Beggars can't be choosers. We have to hurry up and complete this mission before any monsters come!|
101002|It doesn't matter how many of these monsters we kill, they just keep on coming.|
101003|It's a good thing we found the secret of this goddess statue, so we can keep recovering our strength.|
101004|Even so, we need to head back and report on what's up ahead.|
101005|If things carry on like this, we'll never get out of here.|
101006|I just sent a distress signal. Somebody must have noticed it.|
101007|I certainly hope so. I wonder if our comrades fighting elsewhere have been trapped like us.|
101008|If there really is anyone else stuck in a situation like this, I hope the rescue teams come get them soon as well.|
101009|I wish the reinforcements would hurry and get to us already.|
101010|This is my first time in battle. What should I do when I see the enemy?|
101011|You're pretty unlucky, being sent straight to the front.|
101012|Are the monsters scary?|
101013|It doesn't matter if they're scary or not. Just obey your commander's orders and put what you learned during training into practice.|
101014|Sure, but it's terrifying to have to kill a monster using a weapon! What can I do? I've only ever used the wooden swords in training...|
101015|If you don't want to die, take out your weapon and kill the enemies in front of us.|
101016|It's either or that, or become one of the many nameless corpses out here!|
101017|This world is so cruel... but I'll do my best for everyone back home.|
101018|Oh! Oh! My beloved Romeo, why is this place so terrible?|
101019|Oh! My beloved Juliet, no matter how terrible this place is, I will survive as long as you remain here with me.|
101020|People say you only need three things to live V sunlight, air, and water.|
101021|Yet, the only three I need to live are Juliet, Juliet, and Juliet!|
101022|Oh, Romeo. Come closer. I will keep you nourished. I cannot be without you, my love.|
101023|Oh, my beloved Juliet. I too, feel this way. You are my entire world. I cannot be without you, my love.|
101024|In the unforgiving tempest of destiny...|
101025|We follow the light of Gaia and carve our own fate...|
101026|Propelled by our glory and valor...|
101027|We break through the darkness to a bright future...|
101028|As one! As one! Our hearts beat together...|
101029|There's no need for worry, no need for sorrow...|
101030|You are my sword and I am your shield...|
101031|We follow the light of Gaia and carve our own fate...|
101032|We've been fighting almost constantly these days. What do you do when you get some downtime?|
101033|I use my time to cook! I just love cooking.|
101034|I've been getting into cooking, too. I just started learning recently.|
101035|Is cooking really that interesting? What sort of things do you make?|
101036|Sandwiches are my favorite. You can have any filling you like, so never get tired of them.|
101037|How about you, Rabius?|
101038|I discovered a fruit while fighting the other day that can restore your energy. It's called Energy Fruit. Have you heard of it?|
101039|That ugly, nasty fruit that looks like it's been cursed?|
101040|That's the one. It looks adorable!|
101041|I've created a soup. Just boil up the Energy Fruit and add some fat, juicy worms, some medicinal herbs, and voila! It really does restore your energy!|
101042|That's amazing. If we could drink that every night, we'd win this war in no time.|
101043|Are you talking about the soup that put all those people in a coma for two weeks after they drank it?|
101044|I don't know if we'll win this war. We might get wiped out...|
101045| Well, well, well... What's happening?!|
101046|It's freezing. My hands are frozen solid.|
101047|Don't you think it's weird? Why is it so cold? We're wearing the same clothes we always do.|
101048|Do-Don't ask... It's horrible just thinking about it...|
101049|It's freezing cold... When does the relief squad get here? I could really do with a nice fur coat...|
101050|Too bad we only have standard issue equipment. And that's all we've got.|
101051|We're big, strong men. We shouldn't be complaining like this. Suck it up for now, and we can go and have some hot tea later once the relief squad is here.|
101052|Oh, it's so cold... My vision's getting blurry... Am I going to die here?|
101053|No! I can't let this godforsaken place defeat me. I have to get the report back to my comrades...|
101054|Argh, I'm so tired. I want to sleep... And why do I find myself wanting to drink Rabius's Energy Sencha at a time like this?|
101055|I...I have to stay on my feet! I need the Power of Gaia!|
101057|I forgot that I'm just an ordinary soldier.|
101058|What are you playing at? Now's not the time for rest! It'll get dark soon if you don't get a move on.|
101059|Tell me... What is the outside world like? Is it all white, like it is around here?|
101060|The world outside is full of many amazing places, very different from this place!|
101061|There's a vast blue ocean and a hill covered in flowers.|
101062|There's a forest of mighty trees, and a green prairie that goes on for as far as the eye can see.|
101063|There's even a place that's completely covered in sand, and a place with a lot of huge impact craters.|
101064|The world sounds amazing. Can we go and see it?|
101065|Yes! Of course we can. Once this war's over, we can go anywhere we want!|
101066|Great! I can't wait.|
101067|Won't we get lost?|
101068|Lost? Will we get eaten?|
101069|Don't worry. I'll take care of you.|
101070|Great! That's wonderful!|
101071|You're so nice, just like...|
101072|Just like... a Frozen Sorcereress!|
101073|Great! You're a sorcereress! Our sorcereress!|
101074|Nurse, my back doesn't feel so good. Can you take a look?|
101075|Nurse, I'm not feeling good either. I think I've sprained my wrist. Can you look at it for me?|
101076|Nurse, I can't use my magic! Could you help me out?|
101077|Alright, calm down, but please get in line.|
101078|Aah! What an angel!|
101079|A goddess, even!|
101080|Will you marry me...?|
101081|You do know that we're here to protect the Anglers Anonymous Merchants?|
101082|Yes, I know.|
101083|So what are you looking at?|
101084|I'm waiting for someone.|
101085|Who?|
101086|Haven't you talked to Sonia?|
101087|Well... No. Did she say anything?|
101088|Are you all talking about the big turtle? I've heard that the turtle's really huge!|
101089|Heard that? He's my prey. Don't ever try to take what's mine.|
101090|It's good to be enthusiastic... But you do knows that we're only here to protect the Anglers Anonymous Merchants?|
101091|The view's good. Let's go for this place.|
101092|Are you sure you want to build an Artillery Battery here?|
101093|Don't you think that this is a good location?|
101094|Placing an Artillery Battery here will definitely bolster the strength of our army.|
101095|We didn't bring anything with us, though. How are we supposed to build one?|
101096|Don't you know who we are?|
101097|We're dwarven mechanical experts. Show them some Dwarf Power!|
101098|Oh no, where is this?|
101099|Beats me. I wasn't paying attention while we were on the run. We finally got rid of the monster... but now we've lost our way.|
101100|It's so cold here... Are we going to freeze to death?|
101101|Don't be silly. I've just sent out an SOS. I'm sure someone will save us soon.|
101102|I hope someone gets here quickly. I really want to get something hot to drink.|
101103|If only I'd trained a bit harder, I wouldn't have been beaten by a low-level monster like this.|
101104|I'm sorry. You wouldn't be in this condition if you hadn't chosen to save me first.|
101105|Don't say that, just rest. The rescue team will be here soon.|
101106|My dear Juliet... So cold... Why here, of all places...|
101107|The snow here is so beautiful! It might not be all that warm here, but as long my dear Romeo is here with me, I'm not afraid of the cold...|
101108|Hmm... Even so! You'll catch a cold like this... Do you need a coat, my dear Juliet?|
101109|Oh! Romeo! That's so nice of you. My heart is forever warm with you by my side. I don't need a coat or anything else!|
101110|Oh! That's good. Then could you let me have the coat back, dearest Juliet? I'm so... cold...|
101111|... Romeo, you jerk! You're such an idiot! Forget you!|
101112|Damn! I was just careless back then! You won't be so lucky again!|
101113|Maggie, stop! Do you know what you were doing just now?|
101114|Wait, don't go that way!|
101115|I would do anything for the Shadow Knight. I'd even sacrifice my own life.|
101116|Argh... Curses! I will make him pay for that!|
101117|You're all about to be buried here in the Frozenlea Plains!|
101118|Victoria, are you alright?|
101119|Something changed just now... Watch out!|
101120|The Winged Duke must be coming!|
101121|The Winged Duke!|
101122|I have to take care of these dead soldiers. Come find me at the Dark Fortress Bridge later.|

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"The Undead Legion has lost command of the Winged Duke.#br#
@They're completely disorganized! Now is our chance to eliminate them.#br#
@Can you defeat the Undead Giants?#br#
@That would surely put an end to this battle."#npc$$821$1#|

"Those relentless giants are launching their final resistance.#br#
@If you can defeat them,#br#
@this battle is as good as won."#npc$$821$1#|

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"You're very impressive, %n%.#br#
@I was just thinking how wonderful it would be if I could regain my strength#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You reassure Odum that he will one day face the Winged Duke again.#br# 
@Before that happens, however, he must fully recover.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Odum Ryan##br#
"You're right. I have to snap out of it.#br#
@Otherwise, I'll never get stronger.#br#
@Thank you, %n%. I appreciate your help." #npc$$821$1#|
16124|Once the Winged Duke leaves the battlefield, the Undead Legion begins to crumble. Odum asks for your assistance in defeating the Undead Giants and putting an end to the battle of Starstruck Plateau.

Defeat the Undead Giants in Starstruck Plateau and report back to Odum Ryan at the camp.|

"The battle of Starstruck Plateau has finally come to an end.#br#

"Nonetheless, we have retaken Starstruck Plateau,#br#

@We'll send messengers to Anya to tell her the news."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"We just received word from our cohorts at the base.#br#
@They've successfully reclaimed the Silverflash Tribe's territory,"#br#
@Caresha mutters as she reads.#br#
@It seems she's received news from the Hurd Military Base. #M304141$Caresha$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"We plan to attack Highland Cemetery next,#br#
@and then reconnect with Alex there.#br#
@First, however, we must reclaim the Silverflash Tribe territory,#br#
@otherwise we'll remain in danger of being surrounded." #M304141$Caresha$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"It seems Shay has another matter that requires your assistance.#br#
@I'd suggest heading out as soon as possible." #M304141$Caresha$821$1#

"But before you set out for the Silverflash Tribe,#br#
@there's one thing that only you, the Envoy of Gaia, can accomplish.#br#
@I hope you can do us this favor."#npc$$821$1#

16134|The battle of Starstruck Plateau is over, and Caresha tells you that Shay needs your assistance. Return to the Hurd Military Base

16141|#&7$Shay##br#
"Our troubles began when our chief was gravely wounded#br#
@while sealing the Hell Chasm that appeared in our lands.#br#
@After it had been sealed, he needed to recover and regain his former power.#br#
@None of us suspected that a mutiny would soon take place."#npcs85h+30$$821$1#

#&7$Shay##br#
"As our chief was gravely wounded,#br#
@I and some of our elite soldiers escorted him away from the Plateau.#br#
@The waters of Hurd Mineral Lake are well-known for their healing properties."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask why, if lake water is all that is required,#br#
@an Envoy of Gaia was hand-picked for the task.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"The waters of the lake contain a powerful energy force.#br#
@Just as certain concentrated resources can only be handled by the Dwarves, so, too, does the lake require one who can manipulate the Power of Gaia.#br#
@An ordinary person who stays too long in that realm will be overcome by nausea."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod and ask whether there's anything else you need to know.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Shay##br#
"Anya has already sent another mage to explore the area.#br#
@You should try to locate her."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Shay##br#
"Also, be warned that there are some Long-Tailed Minks attempting to invade the stronghold.#br#
@To guarantee the security of the supplies, I'd suggest you eradicate the minks#br#
@on your way to the Mineral Lake."#npc$$1$1#|
16142|#&7$Cambel##br#
"These wild animals are a real headache.#br#
@They aren't just ferocious - they also steal my stuff!" #npc$$828$1#|
16143|#&7$Cambel##br#
"Hey, put that back! That's sensitive data collection equipment!"#npc$$101$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You see a girl trying to scare away a pack of animals.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Ouch! That hurt... Who put that branch there?"#br#
@You watch her retrieve her equipment, then abruptly hit her head on the overhanging branches.#br#
@She shakes her head, dazed and disoriented.#npc$$501$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"...hah? Who are you? You here to help?"#br#
@The girl finally notices your presence and asks what exactly you're doing.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You introduce yourself and tell her why you're here.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"%n%? Then... you're the famous Envoy of Gaia!#br#
@And now I have the chance to team up with you? Far out!"#br#
@Cambel seems thrilled at the opportunity.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Sorry, guess I'm getting a bit carried away, ahaha!#br#
@I forgot to even introduce myself. Call me Cambel.#br#
@I'm from the Ministry of Magic."#npc$$822$1#|
16144|Shay asks that before you visit Hurd Mineral Lake, you eradicate the Long-Tailed Minks near the village to prevent the loss of any more supplies.

Defeat the Long-Tailed Minks, then go to Hurd Mineral Lake and find Mage Cambel for more information.|
16151|#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Cambel how her energy collection is coming along.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Actually, I was trying to collect energy using magic before you arrived.#br#
@The energy in the air is pretty thin, so I wasn't able to nab much, though.#br#
@I was just getting started when these animals attacked."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Perhaps something about the energy attracts them.#br#
@They tried to run off with my Energy Concentrator and Energy Storage Bottles.#br#
@They even took the notebook out of my backpack!"#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"I tried to get my stuff back, but they're just too quick!#br#
@I couldn't catch them, and now I'm missing a bunch of Energy Storage Bottles."#br#
@Cambel appears visibly distraught.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"If it's not too much trouble, could you help me retrieve my things?#br#
@My equipment is pretty heavy, so they couldn't have carried it TOO far,"#br#
@Cambel says, eyes filled with hope.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You remember seeing Cambel hit her head on a branch,#br#
@and decide she could probably use your help.#char$$828:0$0#|
16152|#&7$Cambel##br#
"Their den should be nearby. They can't have gone far!"#npc$$821$1#|
16153|#&7$%n%##br#
@You give the items back to Cambel#br#
@and tell her to take good care of them.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Hey, thanks! Musta been a piece of cake for you, huh?#br#
@Now I can continue collecting energy."#npc$$822$1#|
16154|The wild animals near Mineral Lake are interfering with Cambel's collection work and stealing her equipment. The hapless Cambel hopes you can help her recover her tools and notebook.

Eradicate the wild minks, then recover the stolen tools, bottles, and notebook, and return everything to Cambel at Hurd Mineral Lake.|
16161|#&7$Cambel##br#
"There are strong energy readings all over this area.#br#
@But from where I'm set up, I can only collect a minuscule amount.#br#
@If I'm gonna collect more, I need to venture deeper into Mineral Lake."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"But if I proceed TOO much further, I'll be entering Griffin territory.#br#
@Griffins are extremely territorial.#br#
@You get too close to one of those things and they'll snap your neck in two!"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"If it's not too much trouble, could you drive the Griffins away?#br#
@Then we wouldn't have to worry about, you know, imminent death."#npc$$824$1#|
16162|#&7$Cambel##br#
"With my limited abilities, I could never take on so many Griffins.#br#
@If you hadn't come along, I'd probably end up just being chased away."#npc$$821$1#|
16163|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Cambel that you've driven the Griffins away and#br#
@that the passageway into Mineral Lake is now safe.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Wonderful! I knew it'd be no problem for someone like you.#br#
@Not only are you a legendary hero, you're also MY hero..."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You miss the last thing Cambel says#br#
@and ask her to repeat herself.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Uh... I said, those, uh, yeah! Those Griffins were certainly no match for you, heh."#br#
@Cambel's face has gone slightly red.

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Anyway! Now we should be able to proceed safely.#br#
@The further we go into Mineral Lake, the stronger the energy grows."#npc$$821$1#|
16164|In order to venture further into Mineral Lake without being attacked, Cambel asks you to drive away the territorial Griffins in the area.

Defeat the Cyan Griffins and Brown Griffins, then tell Cambel that the path into Mineral Lake is clear.|
16171|#&7$Cambel##br#
"Ohh... I feel so dizzy..."#br#
@Cambel stops in her tracks.#br#
@She doesn't look so hot.#npc$$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Cambel what happened.#br#
@How are you feeling?#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"I'm all right, but I think the energy in this region may be too strong for me.#br#
@My body can't adapt to it."#npc$$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Cambel looks woozy, as if she might faint at any moment.#br#
@You tell her to rest before going any further.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"I've made it this far, but if I try to go any further, my body might not be able to take it.#br#
@You, though... you seem completely fine. #br#
@Would you be willing to go ahead on your own?"#br#
@Cambel looks extremely unwell.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask why the energy seems to have no effect on you.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Maybe it's because you're an Envoy of Gaia?#br#
@This energy is very similar to the Power of Gaia,#br#
@which might explain why it doesn't affect you,"#br#
@she suggests.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Anyway, if you're able to, please head further in?#br#
@See if you can locate the source of the energy?#br#
@You should be able to collect a good amount of energy in its purest form.#br#
@If you could do that, our mission would be a success."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You confirm that you'll investigate the source of the energy and then remind Cambel to be more careful.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"A renowned hero? Caring about MY safety?#br#
@Ohhh, that makes me so happy!#br#
@Erm... I mean, thank you for your concern, ahaha!#br#
@I'll be sure to take all the necessary precautions."#npc$$824$1#|
16172|#&7$Cambel##br#
"The energy in this area is extremely concentrated.#br#
@I'm starting to feel woozy just standing here.#br#
@Hopefully I'll be able to find my way back..."#npc$$501$1#|
16173|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Cambel about your vision#br#
@and ask if she knows anything about it.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Th-this... is truly amazing!#br#
@But I didn't detect anything that could have caused it.#br#
@Something must have resonated with your powers.#br#
@Do you remember this ever happening before?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You think for a moment... and realize you DO remember having this feeling before - in the Demarech Mines.#br#
@The phenomenon is similar to what Sorceress Hazel has shown you,#br#
@yet somehow... it feels different.#char$$828:0$0#|
16174|Cambel seems to be highly affected by the concentrated energy and becomes unable to proceed. She asks you to help by exploring Mineral Lake and investigating the energy source while she stays behind.

Go to the depths of Hurd Mineral Lake to investigate the energy source, then report your findings to Cambel.|
16181|#&7$Cambel##br#
"That place has the highest concentration of energy.#br#
@Please use these Energy Storage Bottles to collect as much as possible.#br#
@There's only so much I can take back at a time..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take the Energy Storage Bottles Cambel hands you and ask whether you need to use the collection equipment.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"Since this energy resonates with the power of the Envoy of Gaia,#br#
@you should be able to collect it without using the equipment.#br#
@In fact, you'll probably be more effective without it."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod in agreement and tell Cambel to await your return.#char$$806:0$0#|
16182|#&7$Cambel##br#
"There shouldn't be anything here that would cause visions.#br#
@Maybe I should ask around."#npc$$828$1#|
16183|#&7$%n%##br#
@You hand the Energy Storage Bottles to Cambel#br#
@and ask if she has any explanation for your vision.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"I'm sorry, but I don't have a clue.#br#
@I'll see if Sister Caresha or the villagers have any ideas.#br#
@Perhaps there's some history to this place I don't know about."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Cambel to inform you immediately once she finds any information.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"If I discover anything,#br#
@you'll be the first to know,#br#
@even if I have to find you myself,"#br#
@Cambel says, flustered. She nearly drops the Energy Storage Bottle in her hands.#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Campbel to be careful while handling the Energy Storage Bottles.#br#
@You also tell her she shouldn't really be traveling alone#br#
@as danger lurks behind every corner and you'll be too busy to help her.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"I'm sorry, I forgot that your next mission is so perilous.#br#
@Ah, but you might also try asking for help from some of the Silverflash Tribesmen.#br#
@They might have an idea about what's going on."#npc$$821$1#|
16184|Although Cambel can't explain the cause of the vision, she's positive that you experienced it at the source of Mineral Lake's energy. She gives you the Energy Storage Bottle so you can collect the concentrated energy. 

Collect Concentrated Mineral Lake Energy and bring it back to Cambel, who is waiting for you beside Hurd Mineral Lake.|
16191|#&7$Cambel##br#
"Shay advised me before we left#br#

@you should join forces with the elite troops who've infiltrated the Silverflash Tribe."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Cambel##br#
"I heard one of the stronghold soldiers say#br#
@that a group of Beastmasters in the Silverflash Tribe#br#

"You'll have to break through the beast formation#br#
@to reach the elite troops."#npc$$821$1#

"Before we attack the traitors, we must solve one fundamental problem."#npcs85h+30$$821$1#

16221|#&7$Klaus##br#
"The tribe houses their Battle Boars in one particular spot.#br#
@When the tribe comes under attack, they'll release the boars.#br#

16234|Klaus is reluctant to be merciless towards his former compatriots, and he asks you to give them a persuasive letter in hopes that they'll surrender honorably. All who refuse this pardon must be eradicated.

"I heard Cambel's description of your vision.#br#
@I believe it hinges on the presence of the tablet."#npc$$821$1#|

@You ask Caresha about the vision you had at Hurd Mineral Lake#br#
@and ask whether she has any further insight.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Most certainly. Tell me - where you had this vision -#br#
@there was an enormous tablet, correct?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod. During your vision at Hurd Mineral Lake,#br#
@a Woman in White had led you to a tablet.#br#
@You can picture it clearly, though you have no idea what her intentions were.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"The tablet in your vision is real. It is located upon Starstruck Plateau."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"This may be the key to destroying the Undead Legion in Highland Cemetery.#br#
@If so, it is of the utmost importance."#npc$$821$1#|
16264|Cambel tells you that Caresha has a possible explanation for your vision. Palo wants to accompany you to get medical supplies to his father, and you agree to escort him to Starstruck Plateau.

Escort Palo to Starstruck Plateau and speak to Caresha.|
16271|#&7$Caresha##br#
"The tablet you have seen lies northwest of the abandoned village.#br#
@It's been rumored that place was once the headquarters of an evil cult.#br#
@Perhaps the tablet is hiding a dark secret."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"While I was preparing to send more people to investigate,#br#
@I learned that the location was under the jurisdiction of the Winged Duke's Werewolf troops.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask how Caresha knew the tablet's location.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I learned of the tablet's location from a soldier.#br#
@He'd visited Starstruck Plateau once as a child."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I haven't personally seen it, but perhaps you could check with the soldier himself.#br#
@His name is Noddy. I've informed him you may wish to speak with him.#br#
@Feel free to talk to him anytime."#npc$$821$1#|
16272|#&7$Caresha##br#
"They wouldn't simply occupy an abandoned village for no reason.#br#
@They must be after something."#npc$$821$1#|
16273|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Caresha what Noddy said#br#
@and ask why the cult had abandoned its headquarters.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"This village was where the cult's disciples once assembled.#br#
@Many years ago, it was destroyed by the armies of the Church.#br#
@The commander who led the charge against the cult was named Reinhardt."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@After hearing that the cult was attacked by the Church's forces,#br#
@you wonder whether this has anything to do with the Shadow Knight.#br#
@Sure enough, Caresha confirms your suspicions.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"He used to be quite different from what he is today.#br#
@For reasons unknown, he decided to leave the tablet intact."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I think we should take a look at the inscriptions on the tablet#br#
@to see if they contain any sort of incantation."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I'm concerned that if we attack outright,#br#
@our enemies would realize we're after the tablet#br#
@and destroy it."#npc$$828$1#|
16274|Caresha wants to learn more about the village's history and recommends you speak with the Navean Soldier who visited Starstruck Plateau as a child.

Speak with Noddy, the Navean Soldier from Starstruck Plateau, and report to Caresha with information about the abandoned village.|
16275|#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Noddy about the abandoned village to the northwest.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Noddy##br#
"There are many stories told about the abandoned village.#br#
@Once, when I was a child, I traveled to Starstruck Plateau to visit my grandparents.#br#
@The village was already abandoned at that point."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Noddy##br#
"My grandmother said it was once the headquarters of an evil cult#br#
@that performed black magic in the village#br#
@and tried to resurrect the dead..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Noddy##br#
"I was young and foolish, and, one night,#br#
@I decided to sneak out and explore the village.#br#
@There were abandoned houses everywhere.#br#
@Quite creepy, I can assure you..."#npc$$821$1##&PP01802#

#&7$Noddy##br#
"I wanted to go home, but I'd lost my way.#br#
@I ended up wandering deeper into the village,#br#
@where I eventually came across a sinister-looking tablet#br#
@inscribed with strange symbols and characters."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You describe what you saw in your vision.#br#
@It's very similar to Noddy's description of the village.#br#
@You ask Noddy what happened next.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Noddy##br#
"Erm, well... I got a spanking from my grandparents, who'd come looking for me.#br#
@Apparently, the whole town was out looking for me."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Noddy##br#
"Years later, I enlisted in the Church's army.
@After asking around, I learned that the strange inscriptions on the tablet#br#
@are the incantations of a magic spell."#npc$$1$1#|
16281|#&7$Caresha##br#
"We need someone who can sneak into the village#br#
@and get that incantation for us."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You say that you're willing to do it.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Given your skills, I can understand why you wouldn't be afraid of Werewolves.#br#
@But they are extremely wary of intruders,#br#
@and your presence will disturb them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Perhaps instead of heading straight in,#br#
@you'd have better luck diverting their attention.#br#
@When they gather their forces to attack you,#br#
@they'll let their guard down around the tablet."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You agree with Caresha's analysis of the situation,#br#
@but you can't think of anyone suitable to assist you.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I wanted to ask the Dwarves, who have excellent detective skills, to look into this,#br#
@but in order for them to get their people over here and support us...#br#
@Well, that could take days - which we don't have."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Maybe the Silverflash Tribe could help.#br#
@They must be familiar with the surrounding area..."#br#
@Caresha says worriedly.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Palo Ryan##br#
"Look no further. I volunteer to look for that tablet.#br#
@You'll need to instruct me in... in what I have do." #M037050s60h+50$Palo Ryan$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Palo speaks up suddenly, catching both you and Caresha off-guard.#char$$823$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Well, someone of your, uh, build is, in fact, just the right candidate for this operation.#br#
@But you are a member of the Ventos royal family! If you truly wish to take part in this mission,#br#
@I'd advise you to seek the opinion of the Makar Leader."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Palo Ryan##br#
"Of course.#br#
@%n%, I would like you to come with me and convince him.#br#
@I don't want to be the only one who's doing nothing towards the war effort.#br#
@Even if this mission is dangerous, I still want to do it." #M037050s60h+50$Palo Ryan$821$1#|
16282|#&7$Caresha##br#
"There must be something unique about this tablet...
@I have a feeling it is linked to the powers of the Undead Legion."|
16283|#&7$%n%##br#
@You inform Caresha that Leo has agreed to let Palo take on this mission.#br#
@There is, however, one condition: Palo must be escorted by Sharuti while carrying out the mission.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"In that case, we'd better plan how best to go about this.#br#
@We must try to lessen the chances of anyone getting hurt."#npc$$821$1#|
16284|Palo volunteers to join the operation, but Caresha is apprehensive because of his royal identity and asks him to seek Leo's consent first. Palo asks you to come along and convince Leo together.

Inform Caresha of the outcome of your discussion with Leo Ryan.|
16291|#&7$Caresha##br#
"Based on the information we've received from our scouts who've returned,#br#
@there are a great many Subterranean Lurkers lying in ambush along the path we will be taking.#br#
@In order to clear the way for safe travel, somebody must first eradicate them."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You declare that you are prepared to accept this responsibility.#br#
@As Palo and Sharuti will be following in your wake, you'll want to make sure they're in no danger.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Clearing out the Subterranean Lurkers may kick up a disturbance.#br#
@After clearing the path for Palo and Sharuti,#br#
@you could attack the Werewolves and divert their attention."#npc$$821$1#

"This is an Enchanted Memory Sphere.#br#
@Activate the sphere in front of the tablet, and it will automatically record the inscribed enchantments.#br#

"I will." #M037050s60h+50$Palo Ryan$822$0#

"Quite right.#br#
@I've been lying in concealment, surveying the lay of the land for quite some time.#br#
@If I were to let you into the abandoned village, all my carefully laid plans would be ruined."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@From Mia's reaction, you can tell that she is determined to get her way.#br#
@If carrying out your mission will sabotage her plans,#br#
@it could turn her into an enemy.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Since our common goal is to sneak into the abandoned village,#br#
@why don't we join forces? What do you think, huh?"#br#
@Mia seems to have read your mind. Is she suggesting you team up?#npc$$825$1#

"So we all agree we're simply gonna have to work together, huh?"#br#
@Mia smiles smugly.#npc$$821$1#|
16294|In order to make sure the mission is carried out safely, Caresha requests that you work separately from Palo and Sharuti. You will clear the path from Subterranean Lurkers first in order that Palo and Sharuti can travel safely behind you.

Wipe out the Subterranean Lurkers that appear along the route to the Abandoned Cult Village and meet up with Palo and Sharuti again once you are in the village.|

#&7$Mia##br#
"From what I gather,#br#
@the Werewolf Tribe is cooking up something that has to do with that tablet.#br#
@From what I can tell, they're getting ready for some sort of ceremony."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask why Mia is here and what she is looking for.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"I'm here to get my hands on the totem that the Werewolf King's guarding...#br#
@And there's some other... personal reasons as well. Let's leave it at that."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Mia is clearly hinting that she doesn't want you to probe further.#br#
@This is very similar to what happened at Candeo Marsh.#br#
@So you change the topic and ask Mia what she's been planning.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"We need to get into this heavily-guarded area.#br#
@The best way we can do that, I believe, is to create a diversion.#br#
@Since the tablet is so important to the Werewolves,#br#
@we should pretend to destroy it." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"That will cause an uproar amongst the Werewolves.#br#
@In response, they'll muster their troops and give chase.#br#
@And that - THAT, my friend - is when we'll seize the opportunity to sneak in and get nearer to that tablet." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod your head in agreement.#br#
@At the same time, though, you question Mia about how she plans to create this uproar. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"I believe you finished off quite a few Subterranean Lurkers on your way here, no?#br#
@They've got something on them that I need."#br#
@Mia takes out a tiny crimson crystal. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
This a Bloodrock Energy Stone from a Subterranean Lurker.#br#
@I know a certain enchantment that'll convert it into explosive material for making bombs.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Making these kinds of bombs is an obscure form of witchcraft practiced in far distant lands.#br#
@Sharuti has heard of this method of making bombs.#br#
@She can help gather the raw materials for this." #M308010$Sharuti$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"%n%, I nominate you to collect these crystals.#br#
@We'll wait here for you to return with the materials we need." #npc$$822$1#|

@You hand over all of the Bloodrock Energy Stones you've collected to Mia and Sharuti. #char$$822:0$0#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Superb. I reckon we've got enough materials now, and our preparations are almost complete.#br#
@I'll get started on the bomb." #M308010$Sharuti$82$1#|
16304|Mia suggests spreading panic within the Werewolf Tribe by pretending to destroy the tablet, which will require the assistance of a bomb. Mia asks you to gather the materials needed to make the bomb from Subterranean Lurkers after killing them.

@And although there are some weapons he is able to equip for self defense,#br#
@Sharuti is worried he won't be strong enough to withstand an attack." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
Especially from those Werewolf Assassins..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Sharuti would appreciate it if you could defeat the assassins and destroy their weapons.#br#
@She feels this would eliminate the threat to the Eldest Prince." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You agree to help,#br#
@but you don't understand why she has to avoid Palo to ask for your help. #char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"The Eldest Prince is ashamed of the changes to his physique.#br#
@Sharuti doesn't want him being aware of her concern.#br#
@He could suffer a blow to his self-confidence."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Sharuti just couldn't accept it if something she's trying to do for the Prince ends up hurting him instead.#br#
@Sharuti's concern is evident. #npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell her that you understand her intentions. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Sharuti will have to leave this up to you because she needs to work on the bomb." #npc$$822$1#|
16322|#&7$Sharuti##br#
"The Eldest Prince used to be full of confidence and swagger.#br#
@But now, because of the way his physique has changed so drastically,#br#
@he's always so depressed, which worries Sharuti." #npc$$828$1#|
16323|#&7$%n%##br#
@You give the Shattered Blade Fragments to Sharuti.#br#
@You inform her that you've already destroyed the Wolf Assassins' weapons. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Thank you for all you have done, %n%.#br#
@This means the Eldest Prince should be able to complete his mission without difficulty."#npc$$1$1#|
16324|As Palo's body has not recovered, Sharuti is concerned for Palo's safety, and asks for your help in attacking the Werewolf Assassins and destroying their weapons.

"Thanks to all the Bloodrock Energy Stones you collected,#br#
@the detonation rune is now complete.#br#
@Next, we will find out how this most rare form of witchcraft from exotic lands#br#
@can be used to make bombs! ...and to what effect."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Sharuti apologizes for the interruption, but...#br#
@...are you saying you have no experience whatsoever with using this rune?"#br#
@There is a look of surprise on Sharuti's face at Mia's words. #M308010$Sharuti$823$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Oh, pish! I can do witchcraft of this level with my eyes closed."#br#
@Mia replies nonchalantly.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"%n%, kindly set off the bomb in a place where it will cause the most chaos."#br#
@I'm certain that will lure the Werewolf King out."#npc$$821$1#|
16332|#&7$Mia##br#
"If something explodes, they'll have no choice but to summon their leader."#npc$$821$1#|
16333|#&7$%n%##br#
@You let Mia know that the plan is working without a hitch.#br#
@After you set off the Bloodrock Bomb, several places go up in flames,#br#
@and soon chaos spreads amongst the Werewolf Tribe.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"By my observations, I would say that#br#
@the Werewolf King has already rallied his forces.#br#
@All the guards should be clustered around the tablet by now."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"This is all turning out just as I thought it would.#br#
@Now it's time for our surprise attack, wouldn't you say?#br#
@That should throw a wrench in their plans."#npc$$825$1#|
16334|Mia asks you to detonate the bombs in several locations around the Abandoned Cult Village in areas that would cause the most havoc, as the fire should draw the Werewolf King out.

Detonate the bombs at designated locations around the Abandoned Cult Village and speak with Mia afterwards.|
16341|#&7$Mia##br#
"This is the best time to launch an attack!#br#
@They won't know what hit 'em! If we defeat the guards along the outskirts,#br#
@they'll HAVE to draw on the troops who are standing guard over the tablet here.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Let's make the most of this opportunity to get up close to that tablet and get what you want."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Mia about what she herself wants to get out of this.#br#
@You want to know whether she will be able to complete her own objective through this raid.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Ah, don't worry your pretty little head about that.#br#
@It's all going perfectly according to plan."#npc$$825$1#|
16342|#&7$Mia##br#
"The most satisfying thing about working together so far#br#
@is that we've managed to achieve the best possible outcome with the least amount of effort, am I right?"#npc$$821$1#|
16343|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Mia that you've defeated the Werewolf Guards.#br#
@They begin redeploying their troops to guard the tablet. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Very well, then. Now all we need is an opportunity." #npc$$821$1#|
16344|Mia needs you to break through the Werewolf Guards' first line of defense. This will force the Werewolf King to fall back to using the troops guarding the tablet, which will expose gaps in their defense.

Defeat the Werewolf Guards and speak with Mia.|
16351|#&7$Mia##br#
"So, now we have all the work parceled out between us properly,#br#
@I can safely say all our preparations are complete."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod your head, showing that you are fully prepared and ready to start as soon as needed. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Palo Ryan##br#
"I'm ready... Let me take care of the tablet part of this, yes?" #M037050s60h+50$Palo Ryan$821$1#

*Accept the quest as Palo in order to retrieve the tablet inscription from the Abandoned Cult Village.|
16352|#&7$Mia##br#
"Most importantly, we both got what we came for.#br#
@Now THAT'S what I call good teamwork."#npc$$825$1#|
16353|#&7$%n%##br#
@Looks like the totem that Mia is holding is what she came here for.#br#
@She keeps inspecting the totem constantly.#br#
@It looks like it's really important to her.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Whew... I finally got it.#br#
@Everything went exactly the way I planned it.#br#
@A-plus work, guys."#npc$$821$1#|
16354|Mia judges that now is the best time to put the plan into action. Palo will sneak into the Abandoned Cult Village and bring back the inscription while you counter the attacks from the Werewolf King and his Werewolf Tribesmen.

Bring back the inscriptions from the tablet as Palo and counter the attacks from the Werewolf King and his cohorts as yourself. Speak to Mia afterwards.|
16361|#&7$Palo Ryan##br#
"I've got the tablet inscriptions!"#br#
@Palo is bruised and battered and covered in blood (hopefully not his own), but happy as he hastens to meet up with you. #M037050s60h+50$Palo Ryan$101$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"You are hurt, Eldest Prince."#br#
@Sharuti rushes forward to support Palo.#br#
@She looks anxious. #M308010$Sharuti$823$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"You got lucky! Looks like there aren't any major injuries.#br#
@You'll be fine after you get patched up."#br#
@Mia calmly diagnoses him.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mia##br#
"So, that Werewolf mentioned that they've already delivered the tablet.#br#
@Whatever you're after, there's clearly more to it than that.#br#
@Why don't you let me in on all the details, hmm?" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You confirm that you want to decipher the contents of the tablet#br#
@and that this was your real reason for tracking it down.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Mia##br#
"Well, it was nice working with you. Maybe we'll get a chance to collaborate again in future, huh? Who knows!"#br#
@Mia smiles. This is where you say goodbye to each other.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Sharuti is sorry to say that, although she's done the best she can by salving his wounds,#br#
@the Eldest Prince must return to camp immediately to receive proper treatment." #M308010$Sharuti$821$1#

#&7$Palo Ryan##br#
"I ended up dragging everybody into a giant mess in the end.#br#
@I couldn't even carry out the simplest of operations, could I?#br#
@And, to top it all off, I even let my weapon fall into the hands of the enemy. I'm shameful! A disgrace to the Makar people." #M037050s60h+50$Palo Ryan$828$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Sharuti won't let you say such things!#br#
@Who could've expected the enemy to be lying in wait beneath the tablet?#br#
@Despite being completely outnumbered, you still brought the inscriptions back The mission was still a success!" #M308010$Sharuti$821$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"You did the best you could, Eldest Prince.#br#
@How on Terra could you say that you've disgraced the Makar tribe?" #M308010$Sharuti$1$1#

#&7$Palo Ryan##br#
"We haven't completed the mission so long as we haven't delivered the inscriptions.#br#
@That is our priority now. We must keep the orb safe at all costs." #M037050s60h+50$Palo Ryan$821$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"%n%, although Sharuti feels that escorting the Eldest Prince back is of paramount importance,#br#
@she would still like to recover the weapon he lost." #M308010$Sharuti$821$1#

#&7$Sharuti##br#
"Perhaps you understand?#br#
@A Makar's weapon is their pride... their honor!#br#
@We do not take a weapon's loss lightly." #M308010$Sharuti$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

@Since you have now found Palo's lost weapon,#br#
@you decide to head back to camp on Starstruck Plateau.#npcs70h+80$$1$1#

* Report your progress and you will be transported back to the Starstruck Plateau camp.|
16364|Palo was wounded while getting the inscriptions back safely and, in the process, even lost his weapon, which is symbolic of Makar honor. As Sharuti must escort Palo back to camp to receive proper care, she asks you to defeat the monster guarding the tablet and recover Palo's lost weapon.

16371|#&7$Caresha##br#
"%n%, you turned up at just the right time.#br#
@I need to have a word with you about that tablet."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You enquire whether they have found a way to decipher the ancient magic inscriptions. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I have hired a mage who specializes in deciphering just such ancient inscriptions.#br#
@We've made a bit of progress."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"So far, she's only been able to decipher a small portion of it,#br#
@but we can already tell from this much#br#
@that we're talking about a very ancient tablet - one which has power over life and death."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"By performing a special ceremony#br#
@and chanting the words inscribed on the tablet,#br#
@it is possible to resurrect the dead."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"This tablet could very well be the key to the endless resurgence of the undead.#br# 
@If we can put a stop to this incantation,
@maybe we can destroy the Shadow Knight's legions of the undead." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"However, seeing that the Shadow Knight is just as anxious to get hold of this inscription as we were,#br#
@it stands to reason that he hasn't yet found a way to resurrect his long-lost love.#br#
@Otherwise he would have no interest in such magic."#npc$$1$1#|
16372|#&7$Caresha##br#
"I never dreamed that this tablet would be the key to such powerful incantations."#npc$$821$1#|
16373|#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Caresha how long it will take the mage to finish deciphering the inscriptions.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"I couldn't say for sure.#br#
@After all, unravelling magical inscriptions this ancient is no easy task, and takes much time and study.#br#
@We must share the content of these inscriptions with Anya."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Caresha##br#
"Anya and Alex are attacking the base camp,#br#
@so I asked the mages in charge to lend a hand on the front line.#br#
@We believe the Winged Duke has returned to the Highland Cemetery. #npc$$821$1#

"There's a logistic team delivering much-needed supplies to the front line.#br#
@It wasn't long ago that they set out.#br#
@You can follow them to the front line.#br#
@Anyway, we could always do with some extra manpower when it comes to watching over the supplies."#npc$$821$1#

@That's not the only thing that worries me though... I'm afraid the battle is not going well, and the undead are overunning the Highland Cemetery.#br# 
@Even though the troops led by Commander Alex are courageous,#br#
@the situation looks bad."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Wilf##br#
"We're running through our arms supplies like water, and to try to catch up with the rate of expenditure,#br#
@we absolutely have to speed up our supply operations.#br#

#&7$Wilf##br#
"On top of that, whenever we deliver supplies, we encounter ferocious beasts.#br#

"Most of Redwood Forest has been burnt down following outbreaks of fire caused during the battle.#br#

#&7$Dan##br#
"Yes, she was an orphan; she'd lost everything during the war.#br#
@But because Reinhardt, who was a military officer back then, found her,#br#
@she lived in comfort from then on, and was able to study in Navea."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@They say the Shadow Knight owed a good deal to Maggie's efforts.#br#

"It may not mean anything to Reinhardt..." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"But to Maggie...#br#
@Reinhardt is like a father to her.#br#
@As well as being full of admiration for him, she was also completely infatuated."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"So when Reinhardt betrayed the Church and became a Shadow Knight.#br#
@Maggie followed in his footsteps without the least hesitation."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Dan##br#
"It's such a shameful waste of the girl's talent.#br#

"Ahhhh... Reminiscing about the past, and what may have been, always brings such regret.#br#
@I'm sorry to have kept you so long from your duty. Thank you for comforting me, truly."#npc$$824$1#

"I haven't introduced myself, have I? How rude of me. I'm Erika the Mage, #br#
@Lord Gus ordered you to lead us. #br#
@What an honor, I feel so relieved!"#npc$$822$1#|
16544|The scout troops we deployed previously are still on Beastbone Plain. As they are lacking in combat experience, Gus asks you to meet up with the scout troop and lead them onwards as they seek further intelligence about the enemy.

"Who goes there?! Speak your intentions, or it'll go the worse for you!"#br#
@Upon seeing you advance, the soldiers take up a combat stance -#br#
@but they're so nervous, they're stuttering. #M050071s85h+70$Cinda$1001$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You order the soldiers to calm down and explain why you are here. #char$$821$0#

"Oh, so you are the mighty %n% we've all heard so much about, huh?#br#
@Lord Gus ordered you to lead us? #br#
@That's the best news we've had all week! Well, our scouting operation will definitely run nice and smoothly from now on!" #M050071$Cinda$824$1#

"We've discovered that there are large numbers of Demon troops popping up out of nowhere. #br#
@They're loitering around Beastbone Plain, and there are so many that the hills are black with them.#br#
@But none of us have a clue where they came from, because..." #M050071$Cinda$1$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"...'Cause to get to Beastbone Plain#br#
@you normally have to go through Gwer Village, see?"#br#
@The girl next to you both pipes up suddenly. #M310030$Erika$1$0#|
16551|#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Erika if there are any other paths leading to Beastbone Plain, maybe around the outskirts of Gwer Village. #char$$1$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Well, apart from the Gwer Village route,#br#
@the only other way to get there is via impassable cliffs.#br#
@So, no, there are no other paths."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Based on what Erika says, you have to go via Gwer Village to get to Beastbone Plain.#br#
@So that means the Demon Army must have used some other means to seemingly appear out of thin air on Beastbone Plain.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You order the scout team to press on with their mission and gather all possible intelligence.#char$$821$0#

"If we were to proceed further, it would be dangerous, #br#
@There are Demon Scouts everywhere. #br#
@If they discover us..."#br#
@It's not just Cinda who looks dispirited - the whole troop look downcast. #M050071s85h+70$Cinda$1$1#

@You admit that the Demon Scouts are indeed getting too close to the village.#br#
@They have to be wiped out or the village will be in danger.#char$$821$0#

"That's great, since %n% will be leading us!"#br#
@Your speech was successful in rousing the scout troop's flagging morale.#br#
@They brandish their weapons, ready to follow you and rout out those Demon Scouts. #M050071$Cinda$824$1#|
16552|#&7$Erika##br#
"%n%, are you ready to move out?#br#
@Everyone is really pleased to have you leading us.#br#

16553|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Erika that you've wiped out the Demon Scouts.#char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You've barely finished speaking, when the scouts that followed you on your mission#br#
@rush in and tell all the other troop members about how you finished off the Demon Scouts.#br#
@Judging by how animated they are, they have clearly increased in confidence as a result of this mission.#char$$1$0#

"Under %n%'s leadership,#br#

@Cinda runs towards you, shouting. #M050071s85h+70$Cinda$101$1#

#&7$Cinda##br#
"I... I saw that the Demon Army has a... they have something that looks like a portal!"#br#
@Cinda pants, looking extremely flustered. #M050071$Cinda$2$1#

@You try to get Cinda to calm down and speak slowly and clearly.#br#
@Cinda catches her breath and continues. #char$$1$0#

#&7$Cinda##br#
"Have you ever heard of Fenrich's Portal?#br#
@It seems to work the same way as that, but looks more like a Magic Circle.#br#
@I saw demon after demon emerging from the portal,#br#
@so the Demon Army massed on the plain must've got here that way." #M050071$Cinda$821$1#

#&7$Cinda##br#
"Fenrich will be coming with us to Silent Ice Field this time#br#
@to make sure the Teleporter is in good repair.#br#
@If his Teleporter has the slightest thing wrong with it, there won't be any Magic Circle for us to use." #M050071$Cinda$1$1#|
16554|In order to proceed any further, the Demon Scouts up ahead must be exterminated. You decide to head out with the scout troop and take care of the Demon Scouts, while Cinda scouts ahead.

Take command of the scout troop and go eliminate the Demon Scouts, removing all obstacles along the way.|
16561|#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Erika and the rest#br#
@if they have any suggestions about how to destroy the Demon Army's portal.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
@Erika and Cinda look at each other and shake their heads, implying they have no idea. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Wait a minute... if that portal can only be used for transportation alone,#br#
@and there are no other enchantments...#br#
@maybe we can summon the Fire Spirit to destroy it."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"I already successfully performed the summoning magic for the Fire Spirit once, following instructions from ancient scrolls.#br#
@But... I had everything I needed at my disposal then, and I've got nothing here...#br#
@If the materials for casting the spell aren't available, then we can't do it that way."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Everyone's spirits had lifted at the thought of a solution,#br#
@only to plummet after hearing what Erika went on to say.#char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Wait, I've got it!"#br#
@Erika swiftly produced a notebook from somewhere on her person. #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"When I was researching summoning,#br#
@I studied many old tomes, and took copious notes about different ways of performing summoning magic.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"In Sky Tower lore, there is a technique which produces similar results,#br#
@but involves a different process...#br#
@You understand? It means we can still summon a weaker Shaped Fire Spirit!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@There is an uproar among the scout troop members.#br#
@You ask Erika if there's anything the others can help out with.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Can everybody begin extracting Forest Essence from nearby trees, please?#br#
@I'll take care of setting up the brazier for summoning the Fire Spirit.#br#
@While I wait for you to collect the essence, I'll brush up on how to summon again."#npc$$1$1#|
16562|#&7$Erika##br#
"Forest Essence must first be extracted from the trees.#br#
@Finish collecting it, and we'll be ready to summon the Fire Spirit."#br#
@Erika tells you, setting down her notebook. #npc$$1$1#|
16563|#&7$%n%##br#
@You give Erika the Forest Essence everybody has been extracting.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Finished so soon? My, my, you lot are efficient, aren't you?#br#
@Excellent, looks like we do indeed have enough now."#br#
@Erika scrutinizes the Forest Essence minutely, and looks pleased.#npc$$824$1#|
16564|Erika is confident that a Shaped Fire Spirit will be able to destroy the Demon Army's portal. All of you must help with the preparations for the summoning. Erika will set up the brazier while the rest of you collect the nearby Forest Essence.

Extract the Forest Essence from the Gnarled Tree Stump in order to collect the materials necessary for summoning the Fire Spirit.|
16571|#&7$Erika##br#
"I've been thinking...#br#
@If I could just find out a bit more about the teleportation techniques the Demon Army is using,#br#
@it would really help with destroying the portal."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"During teleportation,#br#
@some of the magical energy involved becomes attached to the body.#br#
@By analyzing this energy, we can find out what kind of magic was used to cast the portal."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"If we can just find out what sort of teleportation technique they are using,#br#
@I can adapt the incantation for the brazier accordingly.#br#
@That way I can summon a more effective Shaped Fire Spirit."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod your head in agreement, and ask Erika if she needs any help.#char$$806$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"There are hordes of Demonic Vanguard out there -#br#
@you could get me some of their armor.#br#
@There should still be traces of the teleportation energy on it."#npc$$821$1#|
16572|#&7$Erika##br#
"The Demonic Vanguard is on patrol nearby.#br#
@The energy traces on their armor haven't yet faded.#br#
@If you take too long over collecting the armor, the energy may dissipate."#npc$$1$1#|
16573|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Erika that you've got a collection of armor culled from the Demonic Vanguard.#br#
@You stack up a mini mountain of armor in front of Erika.#char$$806$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Heh, having so much armor does look impressive...#br#
@But what impresses me more is %n%'s skills. #br#
@Simply incredible."#br#
@The entire scout team nods in agreement.#npc$$823$1#|
16574|Erika needs to do some further research into the traces of energy left by the Magic Circle portal in order to understand what teleportation technique the enemy is using. This way, she'll be able to summon a more effective Shaped Fire Spirit to destroy the portal. She asks you to get hold of armor from the Demonic Vanguard for her research.

Get armor from the Demonic Vanguard and give it to Erika for her research.|
16581|#&7$Erika##br#
"The host of demons gathering on Beastbone Plain#br#
@grows greater by the hour. If the portal is not destroyed, #br#
@we'll be in grave danger..."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Although I stood up in front of everyone #br#
@and assured them that I have a good chance of summoning a Shaped Fire Spirit successfully, #br#
@I'm still feel somewhat apprehensive..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Cinda##br#
"Erika, you need to have more faith in yourself!#br#
@Plus, with %n% around, even if we don't manage call up the Fire Spirit, #br#
@there must be another way out of all this." #M050071s85h+70$Cinda$826$0#

#&7$Cinda##br#
"Anyway, when I was out scouting,#br#
@I spotted a particularly hefty looking band of Demonic Warriors. #br#
@I'm pretty sure they must be the commanders of the Demon Army." #M050071$Cinda$821$0#

#&7$Cinda##br#
"When you've successfully summoned the Fire Spirit, #br#
@we'll try and get closer to the portal. #br#
@Why don't you take out those Demonic Warriors now, #br#
@so they are out of the way and there's no danger of attack from them in the future. What do you think, huh?" #M050071$Cinda$1$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"As for that... We'd better ask %n%.#br#
@After all, %n% is in command of the troops, and he is more experienced then we are."#br#
@Erika turns to face you, seeking your opinion.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Both you and Erika agree that Cinda has a good point, and that you had better take the troops and go eliminate the Demonic Warriors.#br#
@Cinda is clearly elated that you're acting on her idea.#char$$806:0$0#|
16582|#&7$Erika##br#
"Cinda did say that band of Demonic Warriors looked particularly strong.#br#
@Please be extra careful when you take them on."#npc$$1$1#|
16583|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Erika that you've taken care of the Demonic Warriors.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Erika##br#
"No wonder you're famous, %n%! #br#
@Looks like you have no equal - enemies don't stand a chance!#br#
@Well I'm relieved, when we destroy the portal, that'll be one less thing to worry about."#npc$$1$1#|
16584|During the course of a discussion between Erika and Cinda, the latter mentions having noticed a band of Demonic Warriors who looked especially strong. Cinda suggests taking out the Demonic Warriors before anything else, so that there's no danger of them attacking while the portal is being destroyed. You agree with Cinda's suggestion and so take command of the scout team and move out.

Eliminate the Demonic Warriors on Beastbone Plain, so the scout team can avoid any hitches in the future.

"Right then, now I need to take a look at all this armor %n% brought back.#br#

"The troops managed to defeat some of the demons.#br#

Head to Springwater Valley to meet with Ronny, and eradicate the Ice Field Sprites and Crystal Sprites that you encounter along the way.|

"We are here under the orders of Lord Gus#br#
@to utilize the healing effects of the hot spring to help cure the injured.#br#
@It seems something went wrong, however, because now we have even more people injured." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
Everyone is cold and hungry.#br#
@I have a bad feeling about this...#br#
@Can you get us some Snowdeer meat#br#
@for emergency rations?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"We must persevere and stand guard here.#br#
@If we choose to retreat now,#br#
@all of our earlier efforts will have been for nothing."#npc$$1$1#|
16642|#&7$Ronny##br#
"We are depending on you to get us the venison for our emergency rations.#br#
@The Sharphorn Snowdeer graze nearby.#br#
@Be careful of their enormous horns. They are sharp and used to protect themselves from predators."#npc$$1$1#|
16643|#&7$%n%##br#
@You hand the venison to Ronny. #char$$1$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Thank you %n%.#br#
@At least now we won't go hungry." #npc$$1$1#|
16644|The constant attacks from the demons have exhausted the troop. Ronny requests that you get venison from the nearby Sharphorn Snowdeer to feed the exhausted medical troop.

Obtain venison from the Sharphorn Snowdeer and give them to Ronny so he may use them as emergency rations for the medical troops.|
16651|#&7$Zoy##br#
"So, we meet again, %n%.#br#
@It's good to see you here."#br#
@Zoy grinned at you. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"There is something I need to ask of you.#br#
@It is a rather small matter.#br#
@But it will raise the spirits of the wounded. I hope you won't mind." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"I'm not sure whether it has to do with the blizzard or not...#br#
@But the camp fire is dying and we are out of wood.#br#
@Could you collect some Deadwood Twigs for us to use as firewood#br#
@and then place them on the camp fire to keep the wounded warm?" #npc$$821$1#|
16652|#&7$Zoy##br#
"If the fire goes out#br#
@their spirits will dampen and their injuries may worsen.#br#
@Please search the area nearby. There are sure to be some Deadwood Twigs to use as firewood." #npc$$1$1#|
16653|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Zoy that you have collected the twigs, and place them into the camp fire.#br#
@The dying camp fire flickers to life and burns strongly once again. #char$$1$0#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"Excellent, you have returned just in time.#br#
@Now the wounded will be able to keep warm. It should brighten their moods." #npc$$824$1#|
16654|The wounded must keep warm and dry, but the heat from the camp fire is dwindling. Zoy asks you to search for Deadwood Twigs that can be used as kindling, and to place them into the camp fire to keep it burning.

Collect nearby twigs and add them to the camp fire to prevent the flame from being extinguished.|
16661|#&7$Ronny##br#
"I am concerned that the demons may destroy this hot spring#br#
@and prevent us from using it." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"We have been here for quite some time already.#br#
@And although we initially defeated the demons with some ease,#br#
@more of us have gotten injured and we are starting to lose more of the fights against the demons than we are winning." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"Ronny, your arm...#br#
@What happened? Are you injured?"#br#
@Zoy breaks in. #M178010$Zoy$823$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Ah! This? It's nothing!#br#
@Tis but a scratch. No need to worry about it."#br#
@Ronny puts on a brave act, but he looks a little concerned. #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"A scratch?! Your arm's... Ronny, this wound is deeper than it looks. You need proper medical care or this will get infected."#br#
@Zoy grabs Ronny's arm to more closely examined the wound. #M178010$Zoy$1$0#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"%n%, can I trouble you to assist us again?#br#
@The antlers of the Greathoof Snowdeer have strong medicinal properties.#br#
@I can use them to heal Ronny's arm and the wounds of the others." #M178010$Zoy$1$0#

#&7$Zoy##br#
"The antlers need to be ground into a fine powder,#br#
@then I can add a bit of spring water and apply the paste to the wounds.#br#
@They will heal much more quickly than if they are left alone.#br#
@It is a very effective medicine." #M178010$Zoy$821$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Even though I'm only a soldier,#br#
@I understand that the hot spring has truly remarkable healing effects.#br#
@It is for that reason that we cannot afford to lose this place."#br#
@Ronny says worriedly, staring at the demons approaching the hot spring. #npc$$1$1#|
16662|#&7$Ronny##br#
"The Greathoof Snowdeer are native to this area and should not be much further ahead.#br#
@Zoy needs their antlers to grind into powder.#br#
@Adding spring water to the powder will allow him to treat my... no... to treat everyone's wounds." #npc$$1$1#|
16663|#&7$%n%##br#
@You place the antlers in a loose pile beside Ronny's leg. #char$$1$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"There are so many antlers...#br#
@"Zoy will be thrilled!" #npc$$821$1#|
16664|While talking to Ronny, Zoy notices an injury on Ronny's arm. She says that by grinding the antlers of the Greathoof Snowdeer into powder and combining it with spring water, she can make a medicinal paste to apply to the wound to help it heal quicker. Zoy needs your help to collect the Greathoof Snowdeer antlers.

Hunt down the Greathoof Snowdeer and collect their antlers. Then give them to Ronny.|
16671|#&7$Ronny##br#
"The situation is currently not in our favor.#br#
@We have fewer and fewer battle-ready soldiers in the medical troop with each passing day.#br#
@With things as they are, we've had to retreat from nearly every battle against the demons..." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"I am confident that Lord Gus will send us reinforcements, but I worry that it will be too late when they arrive.#br#
@%n%, please know that I do not ask you this lightly, but I need you to come with me to battle the demons.#br#
@Your power and strength alone should be enough to eradicate them from this place."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"The medical troops are currently stationed in open areas with very little cover.#br#
@Because each of the areas need to be guarded with as many men as possible, I will join you in the battle.#br#
@We will split up to provide reinforcements for the troops stationed throughout the area."#npc$$1$1#|
16672|#&7$Ronny##br#
"The Aerial Scouts and Aerial Raiders are attacking the medical troops as we speak.#br#
@We need to get out there and provide assistance to these soldiers immediately.#br#
@If we don't, then the demons will surely break through their defenses."#npc$$1$1#|
16673|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Ronny that you have destroyed the Aerial Scouts and Aerial Raiders.#br#
@You mention that you rescued several trapped soldiers and ask him for a status update.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Excellent work. As for me, I've finally found the Aerial Commander!"#npc$$1$1#|
16674|With the medical troops losing their most recent confrontations with the demons, the situation in Springwater Valley is critical. Ronny suggesta that the both of you split up to provide assistance to the troops and to eradicate the Aerial Scouts and Aerial Raiders to rescue the trapped soldiers.

Eradicate the Aerial Scouts and Aerial Raiders occupying the hot spring and rescue the trapped soldiers.|
16681|#&7$%n%##br#
@You asked Ronny about the Aerial Commander.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"While I was out helping the soldiers,#br#
@I felt an overwhelming feeling of dread and knew that an incredibly strong demon was nearby.#br#
@It must be their commander."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Ronny that the Aerial Commander can indeed be defeated.#br#
@The other demons will be plunged into chaos after losing their commander, giving the medical troop the opportunity to eliminate them once and for all.#br#
@You volunteer to defeat the Aerial Commander.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"If there is a single living soul with the power to defeat him now...#br#
@That would be you, %n%...#br#

@Please, be careful."#npc$$1$1#|

"Well done! We couldn't have done this without you!#br#
@I witnessed your powers before in the Emerald Marsh.#br#
@But you have become even stronger than you were back then."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"The Envoy of Gaia truly has powers that far exceed our own.#br#
@I've heard that the Shadow Knight is also an Envoy of Gaia.#br#
@If only he was on our side, like you...#br#
@Just imagine how wonderful it would be if we didn't have to fight against him."#npc$$1$1#|
16684|Ronny discovers the location of the Aerial Commander while out assisting the others. You volunteer to defeat the Aerial Commander, which will cause the demons to plunge into chaos and confusion. This will allow Ronny and the others to eliminate them once and for all.

16691|#&7$Ronny##br#
"Thanks to %n%, we have ensured victory over the Aerial Commander.#br#

#&7$%n%##br#
@The medical troops can finally get some well deserved rest.#br#
@Due to the immediate excitement after the defeat of the Aerial Commander, you did not have a chance to ask Ronny his reasons for coming to the Silent Ice Field.#br#
@Now you finally see your chance and ask him.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"Some of my reasons I am sure you are already aware of.#br#
@My father... he sacrificed himself during the demon attacks in Emerald Marsh.#br#
@And I was powerless to help..."#br#
@Ronny lowered his head, his tone filled with sadness.#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Ronny##br#
"It took me a long time before I figured out what I needed to do. But eventually I decided to join the Church army.#br#

@You introduce yourself to Victoria#br#
@and report the battle situation to her.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Excellent, thank you for bringing me up to speed on the situation in Springwater Valley.#br#
@It seems that no matter where I go or who I speak to,#br#
@I always hear of how you have impacted the lives of others. It must be tough on you, constantly putting your life on the line to help others."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You shake your head in disagreement, insisting that you are simply doing your job.#br#
@You remember that Victoria used to work in the Ministry of Magic,#br#
@and ask her about the illusion you saw.#char$$821:0$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Was it similar to the illusion that you saw previously?#br#
@From what you have described to me, the lady in the illusion seems to be Luciana...#br#
@And the place, well... I'm afraid that is where the Shadow Knight buried her."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You told Victoria that Gus had said as much.#br#
@But neither of you had the opportunity to discuss the topic any further.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"This illusion must have been created by magic, and strong magic at that.#br#
@Only the almighty mages have the abilities required to create such a strong and vivid illusion.#br#
@As I can recall, Luciana does not possess such magical prowess."#npc$$821$1#|
16694|You have defeated the Aerial Commander and Gus's reinforcements will be arriving to Springwater Valley shortly. The medical troops are now out of danger, and Ronny has requested that you head to the Temporary Camp and inform Victoria about the situation in Springwater Valley.

16701|#&7$Victoria##br#
"The battlefront has moved to the Temporary Camp.#br#
@Things are even less optimistic than they were at Springwater Valley.#br#
@Our robot is stuck deep in the snow.#br#

"Fenrich and Montero will be participating in the upcoming battle.#br#
@For now, they are trying to resolve the issues I just mentioned.#br#
@As for Maggie... she wouldn't reveal any information to us.#br#

"Hey, you! I must tell you something#br#
@The Shadow Knight has never known a more loyal or devoted servant than I.#br#
@Unlike you. You who quit the Ministry of Magic to join the Templars...#br#
@And you have the audacity to speak ill of me? Bah!" #M106010$Maggie$827$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Are you done speaking heresy and nonsense?#br#
@If you are unwilling to share useful information with us...#br#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Help?#br#
@Bring Maggie back to Gwer Village.#br#
@We will let Gus continue with this... interrogation.#br#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"Unfortunately, Gus is an Imperial Guard, not a Templar.#br#
@Because of Maggie's identity, she attracts danger wherever she goes.#br#
@Therefore, she must be escorted by a Templar at all times."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"I do know of a way that you can help, however.#br#
@The Spineback Bears nearby have been encroaching on our territory. Drive them back.#br#
@The robot repair team has been reporting difficulty with them while they are trying to collect their materials.#br#
@They cannot do their jobs uninterrupted if those bears are hassling them."#npc$$821$1#|

@We are all grateful for your assistance."#npc$$1$1#|
16704|Victoria tells you that the current situation at the Temporary Camp is not good. Not only is the robot stuck in the snow, but there is a problem with the teleportation system, and the prisoner, Maggie, is not willing to cooperate.

"I have never seen anything like these inscriptions before. They appear to be some unconventional magical incantations...#br#

16744|You successfully locate Fenrich in Ice Crystal Forest. He mentions that the sonic waves coming from the teleporter are attracting Yetis that have started attacking him. He had no choice but to retreat and leave the teleporter behind. In the process he lost his repair tools and notes as well. Fenrich asks you to retrieve the repair tools from the Tattooed Yeti and try to find the fragments of his map that contain his test results.

Retrieve the repair tools from the Tattooed Yeti, and - in the scattered notes - find the fragments of the map which contain the test results.

"The mage who summoned the Shaped Fire Spirit is not here.#br#

"I... I know the method to shut down the portal.#br#

"The portal is activated by the Darkwing Servant.#br#
@Usually there is a Darkwing Steward protecting the portal.#br#
@Then the rest of the Darkwing Servants assist with casting the spell.#br#
@That will keep the portal operating."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Maggie##br#
"As long as the Darkwing Steward is imprisoned#br#
@and the rest of the Darkwing Servants assisting with the spell are destroyed,#br#
@the portal will lose its energy and shut down."#npc$$1$1#

"The Darkwing Steward is much more powerful than the others.#br#
@Ordinary methods of imprisonment will have no effect on him.#br#
@You must use magic to imprison him."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Maggie##br#
"I can use my magic to conjure an Immobilization Rune for you.#br#
@Use it on the Darkwing Steward to imprison him.#br#
@But I will need a catalyst to cast the spell."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mildew##br#
"Fenrich mentioned such a substance.#br#
@It can be used as a catalyst for magic.#br#
@He kept showing it to me - he seemed really excited about it." #M125010$Mildew$821$0#

#&7$Mildew##br#
"If I recall correctly, it's called a Frostbite Crystal.#br#
@Ask Fenrich to give us some. He should have some on him." #M125010$Mildew$1$0#|
16862|#&7$Maggie##br#
"Do you have the Frostbite Crystals?#br#
@I need them to craft the Immobilization Rune."#npc$$1$1#|
16863|#&7$%n%##br#
@You hand the Frostbite Crystals to Maggie.#char$$1$0#

"Thank you."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"I'm still skeptical about giving her the catalyst for casting spells.#br#

#&7$Maggie##br#
"You can suspect me all you want. I do not care.#br#
@You have been treating me like a traitor the entire time I have been held captive."#br#
@Maggie glances at Victoria.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Maggie##br#
"If the Shadow Knight wants me dead, then he can pay the price."#npc$$1$1#|
16864|Maggie explains that, as long as the Darkwing Steward is imprisoned and the Darkwing Servants assisting the spell are destroyed, the portal will shut down automatically. She also offers to craft an Immobilization Rune to imprison the Darkwing Steward. Mildew remembers that the Frostbite Crystals can be used as a catalyst for casting spells. He requests that you retrieve some from Fenrich and give them to Maggie.

"Here, take the Immobilization Rune.#br#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"The situation is critical now, we cannot afford to wait for the reinforcements to arrive."#br#
@Victoria says seriously. #npc$$821$1#

@But if the reinforcements are not aware of the traps,#br#
@that may result in unnecessary casualties.#br#
@You tell Victoria your thoughts. #char$$821:0$0#

"Alright.%n% will provide assistance to the Commander first.#br#
@I will return to the entrance and tell the soldiers about this.#br#

"We have our own sort of revenge to settle as well..." #npc$$821$1#

@You understand that Andre is referring to the Shadow Knight. #char$$806:0$0#|
16994|Victoria advises that since the Frozenlea Plains is the Frozen Sorcerer's territory, we need to be wary of the traps he set. He wants you to catch up with Andre as soon as possible.

"With them around here to take care of the loose ends,#br#

"The Shadow Knight dared to attack the Audience Chamber of the Church.#br#

"%n%, I don't know if you feel it...#br#
@The Shadow Knight's power is different from before."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You realize that Maggie has also said the same thing in Frozenlea Plains.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Although he tried injecting the energy from the Cube of Gaia into Luciana's body,#br#
@I can sense a significant difference between the two...#br#
@The aura emitted by the Cube of Gaia is pure."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"But the power of wielding the Cube of Gaia...#br#
@the Shadow Knight's energy has an aura of darkness."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Besides the dream you had when you were the watchman of the fishing village,#br#
@this is your first encounter with the Shadow Knight in Frozenlea Plains.#br#
@You can feel that he has not yet revealed his true powers. #char$$828:0$0#

#&7$Andre##br#
"If we cannot defeat him...#br#
@The Church... no - the world - will pay the price for it."#npc$$827$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"Even if Maggie had not interfered,#br#
@we still wouldn't be able to stop the Shadow Knight from leaving."#br#
@Andre sighs as he says this.#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Andre##br#
"We were tricked by Maggie.#br#
@Although we had successfully penetrated the Dark Fortress,#br#
@that was just a delay tactic to buy more time for the Shadow Knight,"#npc$$829$1#

@and anger for his foolish compassion towards Maggie.#char$$1$0#

"Victoria is also filled with guilt about Maggie's death and the Shadow Knight's escape, #br#
@but I believe all of you have done your best."#br#
@The Grand Bishop patted your shoulder.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"The Shadow Knight is becoming more powerful. #br#
@Although he was known as the Strongest Envoy of Gaia in the past, #br#
@with the powers that he possesses now, #br#
@he has already far exceeded his former abilities."#npc$$1$1#

@Andre also mentioned that the Shadow Knight's energy is filled with a Dark Aura. #br#
@You ask the Grand Bishop what is his view of this is. #char$$821:0$0#

"I think he is already possessed by the dark side, #br#
@just like the Chief of Silverflash Tribe."#npc$$821$1#|
17014|Although he managed to escape, both you and Andre can sense that the Shadow Knight has become more powerful. Andre wants you to report the incidents on Frozenlea Plains to the Grand Bishop.

17015|#&7$%n%##br#
@As you enter the audience chamber of the Church, #br#
@you see Gus waving at you, beckoning you forward. #M135010$Gus$824$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"%n%, do you still remember this?"#br#
@Gus held up a rune inscribed with symbols.#br#
@It looks familiar.#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%p%##br#
"These inscriptions look similar to those on the rune Maggie was holding on to."#br#
@%p% answers promptly, before you can even respond.#pet$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Gus that this Dark Seal#br#
@triggered an assassination attempt on Maggie, #br# 
@but you and Victoria managed to block the attack.#br#
@And how, from then on, Maggie was willing to cooperate and divulge information. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"So that's what happened..."#npc$$828$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"After what happened on the Frozenlea Plains, Victoria handed the rune to me.#br#
@The inscriptions on this rune are not magic incantations,#br#
@but a rare ancient language..."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Hearing this, you suddenly realize what Gus will say next.#br#
@Scholar Miles, who lost his life in Demarech Mines, is a renowned expert on the research of ancient language.#br#
@And Maggie was his most outstanding student. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The inscriptions are the Shadow Knight's message to Maggie.#br#
@He asked Maggie to buy some time for him."#br#
@Saying that, Gus shakes his head in disappointment.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"At least we had a chance to penetrate the Dark Fortress.#br#
@%n%, please report the details of the incidents to the Grand Bishop."#npc$$828$1#|
17021|#&7$Belenus##br#
"This is an urgent matter and cannot be delayed any further."#br#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Gus, I want you to provide reinforcements at Silent Ice Field.#br#
@No matter what happens, we must hold onto the village on the Frozenlea Plains.#br#
@It's essential to providing medical supplies to the front line."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Err... Yes." #M135010$Gus$823$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"%n%, I hope that you can provide assistance to the battle on Starstruck Plateau,#br#
@then head to the Frozenlea Plains and meet up with Gus.#br#
@As for the details, Gus will fill you in."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod and turn to look at Gus,#br#
@but he looks hesitant. #char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"So you have decided to go through with it?"#br#
@Gus frowns, looking extremely perturbed. #M135010$Gus$826$0#

@The Grand Bishop nods. He waves his hands,#br#
@beckoning you to find out more details from Gus.#npc$$822$1#|
17022|#&7$Gus##br#
"I did not expect that... things had progressed to this stage." #M135010$Gus$1$0#|
17023|#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Gus#br#
@what he and the Grand Bishop are going to 'go through with'.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about that.#br#
@That said, the situation on the front is critical.#br#
@I'm sure you're aware, but we lost the Ventos Tribe's Second Prince during the Battle of Mushroom Forest." #M135010$Gus$828$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"When they learned that the Winged Duke Awaydas had returned to the Plateau,#br#
@the Ventos Tribe's Makar launched an all-out assault." #M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The Ventos Tribe's leader, Leo Ryan, is personally heading the assault." #M135010$Gus$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@The loss of his beloved must have angered Leo terribly.#br#
@If this clash with the Demon Army cannot be averted...#br#
@even more people will be sacrificed.#char$$828:0$0#|
17024|The Grand Bishop requests that Gus head to the Silent Ice Field to look after some things. In the meantime, you have been assigned another mission on Starstruck Plateau.

17031|#&7$Gus##br#
"Starstruck Plateau is the location where the Shadow Knight opened the Dimensional Rift.#br#
@It's one of the headquarters of the Demon Army."#br#
@Gus says, solemnly. #M135010$Gus$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"%n%, do you remember the Silverflash Tribes of Oblitus Wood?"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod, recalling the Silverflash Varan's presence in the Oblitus Wood.#br#
@At the time, in order to rescue their injured chief,#br#
@they took over the pool of Krok Village, to aid in his recuperation.#char$$806:0$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"True, and the Silverflash Tribe's village is located on Starstruck Plateau.#br#
@The whole reason their chief was injured in the first place is because he tried closing the Dimensional Rift.#br#
@After he was injured, traitors emerged among the tribe who decided to join the Demon Army."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@It looks like besides the Makar of the Ventos Tribe,#br#
@Shay of the Varans is also leading his army to the Plateau.#br#
@There, a battle for vengeance will unfold between the two tribes and the Demon Army.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"The Ventos Tribe and the Silverflash Tribe are not under the Church's command.#br#
@They need someone with influence to decide their plan of action."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"That's why we're sending you.#br#
@%n%, you have their trust, even if the Church doesn't."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@What Gus is saying makes sense.#br#
@Besides, this is the best opportunity to get revenge for Para...#br#
@With these thoughts running through your head, you probe Gus on what's happening in the Silent Ice Field.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Gus##br#
"After the battle on Starstruck Plateau is concluded,#br#
@come to Frozenlea straight away. I'll meet you in Gwer Village.#br#
@For now, please make your way to Starstruck Plateau."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Gus##br#
"Anya is in charge on the Plateau.#br#
@You should find her at the Hurd Military Base.#br#
@Clint should also be there. He's a warrior on the front lines who will give you a heads-up on the situation."#npc$$821$1#|
17032|#&7$Clint##br#
"Starstruck Plateau is in a critical situation! The injured just keep piling up.#br#
@The Makar's battle plan is just too reckless.#br#
@The way it is now, though, there's no way we can turn things around!" #M305041$Clint$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@The first thing Gus wants you to do after reaching the Hurd Military Base#br#
@is to meet up with a warrior from the front lines.#br#
@That warrior, Clint, is probably the person speaking with Anya right now.#char$$1$0#|
17033|#&7$Vanguard Soldier##br#
"Lord %n%, please come this way." #M121010$Vanguard Soldier$822$1#

@you spot Anya holding a strategy meeting with one of the warriors.#br#
@The soldiers standing nearby gesture ceremoniously, signaling you to proceed ahead.#char$$1$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"%n%, you've finally arrived.#br#
@Allow me to introduce Clint, one of the front line warriors here on the Plateau."#br#
@Anya says as she looks at you, nodding. #M138010$Anya$827$1#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Clint, this is %n%.#br#
@I believe all the soldiers have heard that name before." #M138010$Anya$821$1#

#&7$Clint##br#
"Of course! Who wouldn't have heard of one as famous as %n%?#br#
@We would need his help for this matter on the Plateau."#br#
@Clint pouts, glaring at some of the nearby Makar. #M305041$Clint$821$0#

#&7$Anya##br#
"Clint, for the benefit of %n%,#br#
@Please reiterate the situation on the front lines.#br#
@Besides, we've yet to come to a conclusion on certain topics." #M138010$Anya$821$1#|
17034|Gus wants you to oversee the battle on Starstruck Plateau, since the Makar and the Silverflash Tribe are about to wage a battle of vengeance against the Demon Army.

17041|#&7$Belenus##br#
The Silverflash chief only wanted to close the Dimensional Rift.#br#
@He ended up being devoured by this unfathomable dark aura,#br#
@which inflicted permanent internal injuries."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Reinhardt transformed the Dark Energy he obtained into power.#br#
@It's an unorthodox method of revenge, and might put him on the path to darkness,#br#
@eventually becoming a pawn of the Infernal Demon."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Most importantly, we need to find a way to retrieve the Cube of Gaia...#br#
@and maybe, before the darkness falls, to defeat Reinhardt."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You suddenly recall the illusion of Luciana.#br#
@You mention how you told the Grand Bishop that you've repeatedly seen illusions of Luciana.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"Regarding that, I am unable to give you a clear answer.#br#
@Indeed, it is a relatively complex spell.#br#
@For a human mage to cast such a spell, they would need a catalyst."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"If it wasn't someone attempting to fool you by adopting Luciana's guise,#br#
@then I can only speculate that it has something to do with her being injected with the powers of the Cube of Gaia.#br#
@As the Envoy of Gaia, your own energy resonates with that of the Cube, correct?"#npc$$827$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@"Well, it is possible.#br#
@As the Grand Bishop said, however, there is no way to know the exact answer.#br#
@Judging from everyone's response, other than yourself,#br#
@no one else has seen the illusion before. Not even the Shadow Knight."#char$$821$0#

#&7$Belenus##br#
"The Ministry of Magic will find the whereabouts of Reinhardt.#br#
@You should speak to Victoria, who has already returned to Navea."#npc$$821$1#|

@would things have turned out differently?"#npc$$824$1#|
17043|#&7$%n%##br#
@You asked Victoria the whereabouts of the Shadow Knight.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"During our encounter in the Frozenlea Plains, although Maggie blocked my attack,#br#
@I managed to cast a tracking spell on Luciana."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"The Ministry of Magic is tracking that spell.#br#
@As long as the Shadow Knight remains with Luciana,#br#
@I believe we'll be able to ascertain their location soon enough."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

"%n%, there are some things I don't know whether I should say."#npc$$828$1#

@But none of us have received any information, nor instructions."#npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#

#&7$Victoria##br#
"I discovered the bishops from the surrounding lands have been summoned.#br#
@Some of them have already reached Navea, which is something that has never happened before.#br#

"Regarding this, I'll keep looking into it privately.#br#
@If there are any further developments, I shall let you know.#br#

"To keep the war efforts on the Plateau going, the consumption of military resources has been far greater than expected.#br#

@Eddie carefully describes this to you. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Eddie##br#
"There are still a few Totems on the Starstruck Plateau.#br#

"You wanna know more, huh? Legend has it that #br#
@sometime long, long ago, before reckoning, #br#
@a thousand meteors fell upon this Plateau, #br#
@shaping it into what it is today." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Terice##br#
"According to the elders, #br#
@this cataclysmic meteor shower created a landscape of craters, #br#
@which, in turn, gave rise to countless new species." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Terice##br#
"Those semi-transparent creatures hiding in the water #br#
@use poisonous tentacles to attack their prey. #br#
@Few people have ever seen these creatures, #br#
@and those who lived to tell the tale were terrified." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Terice##br#
"I know some crazy fishermen, however, #br#
@who get a kick out of challenging these fearsome creatures. #br#
@Of all the creatures to watch out for, there is a certain beast that stands out from the rest." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Terice##br#
"It's enormous - you can't miss it. #br#
@First, it paralyzes its prey with poisonous tentacles, #br#
@and, as the poison takes effect, it slowly devours its immobilized victim. #br#
@Please be extremely careful if you run into it." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Terice##br#
"This unidentifiable new species is a powerful Fish King. #br#
@If you wish to catch him, #br#
@you'll need powered fishing gear of level four or higher. #br#
@You'll be more successful with the right gear." #npc$$824$1#|
7588|#&7$Terice##br#
"Oh, my!#br#
@Isn't this the great Fish King of legend?! #br#

@We wouldn't be so cold if we had something to do. #br#

"I guess that's exactly why #br#

@Who am I talking about? Why, just look at them - those cute turtles!" #br#
@Sonia motions towards some turtles crawling on the ground nearby. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sonia##br#
"I hear they've been living here for ages... literally! #br#
@Apparently, in this natural and unsullied environment, #br#

@Sonia emphasizes her point with exaggerated hand gestures. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Sonia##br#
"It's only because of human interference #br#

@And now, I-... I think my mother sent me here for just that reason." #br#
@Jonissa banters happily. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"Oops! Look at me, babbling away. #br#
@Our time is almost up! #br#
@What can I do? My friends and I agreed to #br#
@meet in the forest once we get time off." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"Oh, yeah! Someone ate all the transformation apples! #br#
@I was just trying to think of a solution #br#
@when I started chatting away with you..." #br#
@Jonissa seems unconcerned by the troubling nature of this issue. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You asked her about transformation apples. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"Well, they're these magical apples that Natalia gave me. #br#
@The apples are how I made so many new friends! #br#
@Of course, Natalia is my best friend of them all." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"They must be running more missions lately, though, #br#
@because Natalia hasn't visited me in a while. #br#
@I'm worried about her. Can you check up on her for me?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"Natalia should be standing guard at the east gate to the village. #br#
@I'm counting on you!" #br#
@Jonissa thanks you, polite as always. #npc$$822$1#|
7768|Here's that transformation apple you were looking for.|
7769|#&7$Jonissa##br#
"Didn't you say you were too short on manpower to cook dinner today? #br#
@Because that's a big problem! #br#
@We'll starve without dinner. #br#
@Think of our poor tummies!" #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"But hey - if you help me out in the kitchen, that'd be rad! #br#
@I don't have any active missions right now, so that's not a problem... #br#
@But we don't have any ingredients on hand! #br#
@What to do, what to do..." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"Oh, right! #br#
@I just baked an apple pie. #br#
@This is one of my best dishes, you know. It's super piping hot, just like the sun! #br#
@If you could, bring some back to share with everyone?" #br#
@Jonissa flashes you a brilliant smile and hands you the Sun-Baked Apple Pie. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You happily accept the pie and thank Jonissa. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Jonissa##br#
"Hehe, come chat with me again if you have the time. I'd be delighted if you did!" #br#
@Jonissa waves happily at you as you take your leave. #npc$$821$1#|
7770|#&7$Natalia##br#
"Look at that cloud in the distance. #br#
@Don't you think it looks like the profile of some beautiful goddess?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"There, to the right - no, not that one - yes! That's the cloud! It's almost as pretty as I am. #br#
@Well, I'm still prettier, of course, #br#
@but it's certainly noteworthy. Hehe." #br#
@Natalia smiles bashfully. #npc$$821$1#|
7771|What are you doing here?|
7772|#&7$Natalia##br#
"Well, I'll be! Aren't you the famous %n%? #br#
@How come you have time to speak to an insignificant soldier like me? #br#
@You're not coming onto me, are you?" #br#
@Natalia flashes her trademark bashful smile again. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"I'm just the best! Even this plain old armor #br#
@can't hide my incomparable charm! #br#
@I wonder if my makeup has been smudged?" #br#
@Natalia hastily takes out a mirror to check her face. #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"Phew, everything looks normal. #br#
@Ahem. Now then. Pardon me for going off topic. #br#
@You wanted to know what I'm doing? #br#
@Well, I've been assigned to this boring, old recon mission..." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"The only reason I'm in this dreary place is because the pay is so good here... #br#
@Oh, right! You arrived just in time. I was going to give Jonissa some apples, #br#
@but as you can see, I don't have time to look for ingredients right now! #br#
@Can you help me out?" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod in agreement. #br#
@What ingredients do you need for the apple delivery? #char$$821$0#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"Weeeeell, it's like this, see? #br#
@I make magical items as a hobby, #br#
@and I inadvertently created this apple a while ago. #br#
@This is no ordinary apple, mind you, as it can transform a person into a Snow Sprite!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Natalia,  "Isn't it dangerous to turn someone into a Snow Sprite?" #char$$821$0#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"Well, the effect takes some time to wear off, but there aren't any side effects. #br#
@The problem, though, is that the fighting has gotten so chaotic, the army might mistake you for a monster! #br#
@But Jonissa says she uses them to chat with her Snow Sprite friends, #br#
@so I can't bring myself to turn her down." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"To make transformation apples, #br#
@we'll need a Demonic Flower. #br#
@They grow over there." #br#
@Natalia points to a small patch of flowers growing outside the East Gate. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"But I'm currently on duty, #br#
@and I can't leave my post. #br#
@I'd like you to pick five flowers for me." #npc$$822$1#
|
7773|Here are those Demonic Flowers you asked for.|
7774|#&7$Natalia##br#
"Yes, these are Demonic Flowers, indeed! #br#
@You actually brought back the right kind... #br#
@You're every bit as benevolent as people say!" #br#
@Natalia gratefully takes the Demonic Flowers. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"Patience, patience! They'll be ready soon. #br#
@Here's an apple for you as thanks." #br#
@Natalia gives you an apple, which you take without hesitation. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
@As soon as she's done talking, Natalia begins to process the Demonic Flowers. #br#
@She turns the Demonic Flowers into a potion and sprays it over the apples. #br#
@You casually eat your apple as you try to keep up with Natalia's quick movements. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Natalia##br#
"Aaaaand they're done! #br#
@Can you help me take these #br#
@to Jonissa, please?" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You finish eating your apple and accept Natalia's transformation apples with a nod. #char$$822$0#
|
7775|#&7$Natalia##br#
"Yes, these are Demonic Flowers indeed! #br#
@You actually brought back the right kind... #br#
@...but you're still missing some. #br#
@We need five in total. Please pick some more flowers." #npc$$822$1#

You don't have five Demonic Flowers.|
7776|#&7$%n%##br#
@You bring the injured Bluebird to Reneya. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reneya##br#
"Is that you, my dear Bluebird? #br#
@It IS you! It is!! #br#
@But... what happened to you?!" #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Reneya##br#
"Thank you for finding my beloved Bluebird. #br#
@Alas, I'm busy right now and can't leave what I'm doing. #br#
@Could you take my dear Bluebird to Astra? She should be near the Traveling Priest.
@Astra should be able to help my Bluebird, so please take her there!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You agree to bring the Bluebird to Astra. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Reneya##br#
"I'm so sorry, #br#
@but could you please go again?" #npc$$822$1#|
7777|#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"I can't believe my old wounds suddenly flared up again, #br#
@and in such a cold place, no less! #br#
@What can I do? I can hardly feel my wings any more. #br#
@I'll die here if this continues!" #npcs30h+99$$501$1#|
7778|You look injured. Are you alright?|
7779|#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"You not afraid of me, human?" #npcs30h+99$$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You shake your head and ask the dragon about its wounds. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"You are a strange one, human. #br#
@I could understand if you were not afraid because of my injuries, #br#
@but you're saying you actually care about me? #br#
@You must want something!" #npc$$2$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You keep a straight face and ask if there's anything you can do to help. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"Well, well. I can tell that a powerful force dwells within you. #br#
@You must be %n%, the human of rumor and legend." #npc$$2$1#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"I thought I was going to die in this wretched place, #br#
@but you arrived just in time. #br#
@Isn't this fortunate, yes..." #npc$$501$1#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"I normally don't rely on anyone but myself, #br#
@but if you're the one helping me, #br#
@I suppose I wouldn't feel so ashamed." #npc$$501$1#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"I was wounded quite some time ago. #br#
@I had thought it completely healed, but it's begun to flare up again. #br#
@My wings hurt so much, they're starting to go numb!" #npc$$501$1#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"Ordinary healing magic and potions have no effect on me, #br#
@but with an energy tonic, #br#
@I could at least stabilize my wounds. #br#
@After that, I can think about what to do next." #npc$$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask the dragon where you can find this energy tonic. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"Any qualified nurse #br#
@should know how to make an energy tonic. #br#
@Why don't you go to the village #br#
@and ask a nurse about it?" #npc$$501$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You agree to help and ask the dragon to await your return. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Dragon with Broken Wings##br#
"You're actually concerned for a fearsome creature like me. #br#
@You are a strange human, indeed! #br#
@But for reasons I can't explain, I trust you. #br#
@I will wait here for you... no matter how long it takes!" #npc$$2$1#|
7780|I've brought you an energy tonic.|
7781|#&7$Astra##br#
"Maintaining the health of every soldier here #br#
@is my call of duty. #br#
@So long as I can put a smile on each patient's face, #br#
@I feel as though I've done my job." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"But this war... #br#
@I wonder when it will end?" #npc$$828$1#|
7782|You mention the dragon.|
7783|#&7$Astra##br#
"What?! "A dragon, you say? #br#
@That's incredible! #br#
@What's that? It's injured?" #npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Astra everything you know about the dragon. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"I see, I see... So, his old wound flared up again, #br#
@and now he needs an energy tonic. #br#
@I didn't expect the dragon to be so knowledgeable. #br#
@Energy tonics are quite effective on most creatures, but I have no idea how it will affect a dragon..." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"What a shame that I don't have any energy tonics on hand, #br#
@and I don't have enough ingredients to make one, either. #br#
@It isn't something you can just make at the drop of a hat." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Hmmm... #br#
@As it so happens, however, I DO know of something that has a similar effect. #br#
@Have you heard of Rabius in Gwer Village? She's quite passionate about cooking. #br#
@One of her signature dishes is the Healthy Energy Broth." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"That particular recipe is considered a deadly weapon in Gwer Village. #br#
@Many people have tried it #br#
@only to fall into deep comas for weeks! #br#
@It's a scary sight to behold, and I hope I never encounter it in another patient." #br#
@Astra's expression twists into agony as she recounts her scary tale. #npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You gulp subconsciously, awed by the thought of this mighty dish. #char$$823$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Nonetheless, the Healthy Energy Broth is also extremely effective. #br#
@It greatly enhances the body's mental and physical strength. #br#
@The problem is, however, that we don't know how to isolate its fearsome poison." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"If we could extract the poison from the broth, #br#
@it might actually prove to be an effective medicinal remedy. #br#
@It's decided, then! #br#
@Can you get me a bowl of Healthy Energy Broth from Rabius?" #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You agree to bring back some Healthy Energy Broth from the village cook. #char$$821$0#|
7784|#&7$Astra##br#
"I spoke with a soldier on patrol last night, #br#
@and he told me that not long ago, #br#
@he saw a dragon soaring through the sky. #br#
@Quite the uncommon phenomenon, to say the least." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"I've heard rumors that the dragon's nest is nearby, #br#
@but no one has actually laid eyes on it... and lived to tell the tale. #br#
@Could it be hiding? That would certainly be peculiar." #npc$$821$1#|
7785|I've brought you some of that Healthy Energy Broth.|
7786|#&7$Astra##br#
"Welcome back, %n%! #br#
@You've been working hard... and so have I! #br#
@While you were gone, I prepared the antidote!" #br#
@Astra takes the Healthy Energy Broth and examines it with great interest. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"So, this is the legendary Healthy Energy Broth... #br#
@It looks like it will be extremely effective, indeed. #br#
@But... why is it so poisonous? That's still a mystery to me." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"That Rabius might have the talent to become an Alchemic Grand Master! #br#
@A grand master in POISON! #br#
@I'm sorry, I'm sorry - that was a joke. Please forget I said anything." #br#
@Astra relishes the moment with an impish grin before turning her attention back to the antidote. #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"There! It's complete! Once the poison is removed, #br#
@this incredibly powerful dish will act just like an energy tonic. #br#
@In fact, it might even be BETTER than the energy tonic!" #br#
@Astra peers curiously at the Healthy Energy Broth in the bottle. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Oh, please excuse me. I've wasted so much of your time already. #br#
@Here is the detoxified Healthy Energy Broth. #br#
@You can take this to the dragon." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take the bottle filled with Healthy Energy Broth and thank Astra. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"No need to thank me! #br#
@Helping others is my job and my passion. #br#
@It's just that... #br#
@Well, I'd love to see that dragon with my own eyes..." #npc$$821$1#|
7787|Tell me about the responsibilities of a nurse.|
7788|#&7$Astra##br#
"I'm responsible for the well-being of everyone here, #br#
@be they soldier or resident. #br#
@I produce medicine for anyone who needs it, #br#
@and I can even use healing magic if I need to!" #br#
@Astra gives you a conspiratorial wink, then asks if you've encountered any illnesses. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Astra about Karian's sore throat. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Karian has a sore throat, you say? #br#
@Why, that's not good at all! #br#
@Her singing is the only thing that #br#
@keeps my job from being a complete bore..." #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"It helps calm the nerves, you see, #br#
@and it's always had a positive effect on my patients, too. #br#
@She has a real fan base!" #br#
@Astra's face beams as she tells you about the fans, indicating that she might be one herself. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Anyway, it's too bad I don't have any throat lozenges on hand. #br#
@But wait! If you collect the ingredients for me, #br#
@I can make her some right now!" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod in agreement, happy to be of help. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"You're such a reliably good person! #br#
@Let's see... I need four peppermint leaves to make throat lozenges. #br#
@You can pluck them from Peppermint Grass outside the West Gate. #br#
@Once again, I'm counting on you!" #br#
@Astra curtseys respectfully as you prepare to leave. #npc$$822$1#|
7789|#&7$Astra##br#
"I'm responsible for the well-being of everyone here, #br#
@be they soldier or resident." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"I produce medicine for anyone who needs it, #br#
@and I can even use healing magic if I need to! #br#
@As long as I can bring smiles to peoples' faces, #br#
@my life is complete." #npc$$824$1#|
7790|Can you help me make throat lozenges?|
7791|#&7$Astra##br#
"You're back, %n%! #br#
@Ah, and you have the peppermint leaves we need. #br#
@Well done, well done." #br#
@Astra takes the peppermint leaves and hands you a cup of water. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You sip water from the cup while you watch Astra manufacture the lozenges. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Finished! These are the throat lozenges that Karian needs. #br#
@Her throat seems to be bothering her a lot these days. #br#
@I wonder if she's been pushing her voice too hard?" #br#
@Astra packs up the lozenges and hands them over to you. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Now, it's up to you to give her these throat lozenges." #br#
@Astra smiles politely and waves you goodbye. #npc$$822$1#|
7792|#&7$Astra##br#
"Yes, these are peppermint leaves alright, #br#
@but I need four of them to make the lozenges. #br#
@You're still missing a few. #br#
@Please go pick some more! I know you can do it!" #npc$$824$1#|
7793|I heard you can cast healing magic on injured people?|
7794|#&7$Astra##br#
"Hello, there! Aren't you... %n%? #br#
@What could possibly have you so flustered?" #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You carefully hand Astra the injured Bluebird you've been cradling in your arms. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"Oh, dear! Isn't this Reneya's treasured Bluebird? #br#
@How did it get so hurt so badly?!" #npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Astra what happened. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Astra##br#
"I see... It's a good thing that Lovelow saved it, #br#
@otherwise who KNOWS what might've happened... #br#
@Anyway, let me cast a healing spell on it." #br#
@Astra immediately begins to cast a healing spell on the injured bird. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You stand by silently, watching her incantations with awe. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Bluebird##br#
"Chirp! Chirp!" #br#
@The healing spell works fast, and soon the Bluebird is singing again! #M09304330h+59$Bluebird$828$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"What an energetic little birdie! #br#
@Now you can relax and return to your master, right?" #br#
@Astra gently pets the grateful Bluebird before handing it back to you. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Astra##br#
"%n%, #br#
@thank you for bringing the Bluebird to me. #br#
@Now, I need you to return the bird safely back to Reneya." #br#
@Astra curtseys politely after she finishes speaking. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You bow, in turn, and take your leave. #char$$821$0#|
7795|#&7$Rabius##br#
"Cooking brings me so much joy! #br#
@The happiness I feel when I'm cooking - #br#
@and the happiness I get when others enjoy my food - #br#
@well, that's what makes me tick!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"My Healthy Energy Broth is so close to perfection, #br#
@but my other dishes haven't improved much. #br#
@Maybe I should spend more time on the others?" #npc$$821$1#|
7796|Tell me about your signature dishes.|
7797|#&7$Rabius##br#
"Oh, so you've already heard of my Healthy Energy Broth? #br#
@Marvelous! #br#
@It's my favorite - I've got nothing but love for that dish!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Rabius about the injured dragon. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"A dragon... and it was injured?! #br#
@How terrible!" #br#
@Rabius is suddenly very concerned. #npc$$823$1#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"But you... think that #br#
@my Healthy Energy Broth can cure it? Is that true?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod affirmatively. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"I can't believe it! That's brilliant! #br#
@I always wanted people to become more energetic - #br#
@that's why I developed the Healthy Energy Broth in the first place. #br#
@But... I never expected it to work on a dragon!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"But we have a little problem... #br#
@I don't have the ingredients to make a second bowl right now." #br#
@Rabius presses her lips together in concern. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"Wait, I know! I just made a big bowl #br#
@to share with everyone, #br#
@but the dragon needs it more than us. #br#
@Please - take it, take it!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You're unsure, so you ask Rabius again if it's alright. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"Don't worry about it - #br#
@we can just eat something else for lunch! #br#
@Please bring this Healthy Energy Broth to the dragon." #br#
@Rabius smiles as she hands you the broth. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take the Healthy Energy Broth and thank her profusely. #br#
@Suddenly, you remember Astra's words. You need to bring this Healthy Energy Broth to Astra first! #char$$821$0#|
7798|#&7$Rabius##br#
"So, you've already heard of my Healthy Energy Broth? #br#
@Marvelous! #br#
@It's my favorite - I've got nothing but love for that dish!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"But it's hard to gather ingredients in these chaotic conditions. #br#
@I could make it for you if you got me the ingredients! #br#
@You'll need three pieces of Energy Fruit and two Tough Earthworms." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"If you go to the western part of Springwater Valley, #br#
@you'll find Energy Fruit and Fertile Mounds where the Tough Earthworms live. #br#
@Come back to me once you've gathered all the ingredients." #br#
@Rabius continues to go about her affairs. #npc$$821$1#|
7799|Could you make me a bowl of Healthy Energy Broth?|
7800|#&7$Rabius##br#
"You want me to make you some Healthy Energy Broth? #br#
@Then you must like it, too! I'm delighted! #br#
@But alas, I'm fresh out of ingredients. So sorry." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You give Rabius your prepared ingredients. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"Wow, I can't believe you prepared these yourself! #br#
@Now I can make you a bowl, no problem-o. #br#
@Just give me a few minutes to get everything ready." #br#
@Rabius wastes no time and starts cooking in a flurry of activity. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You wait a little while for Rabius to finish up. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"Here you go! My Healthy Energy Broth. #br#
@Be careful - it's hot! If possible, it's best to drink it hot!" #br#
@Rabius gives you the Healthy Energy Broth. #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You gratefully accept it, thanking Rabius for the help. #char$$822$0#|
7801|#&7$Rabius##br#
"Didn't you say there wasn't enough food for tonight's dinner? #br#
@Oh, no! Now what can we do...? #br#
@I'm normally all too glad to share my signature dish, the famous Healthy Energy Broth, #br#
@but I just ran out of fresh ingredients..." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask Rabius if she can make a different dish. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"Another dish? #br#
@Look - it's like this. #br#
@I'm currently preparing lunch, so I could cook some for everyone at the same time, #br#
@but honestly I'm not that good at anything other than Healthy Energy Broth.  Are you still interested?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You assure her that you're still interested. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"All right, all right, then please wait a moment.  I'll get right to work!" #br#
@Rabius wastes no time and starts cooking in a flurry of activity. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"It's done! This dish is called Daybreak's Splendor. My mother taught me how to make it. #br#
@I'm not too great at it, but I think it should taste all right. #br#
@I also made some cold drinks to cool you off. #br#
@Please bring back enough for everyone!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take Daybreak's Splendor and thank Rabius for her efforts. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Rabius##br#
"I just hope that everyone who tries my cooking #br#
@is as happy about it as me. #br#
@If I happen to have some Healthy Energy Broth ready the next time you drop by, #br#
@I'll gladly share it with you!" #br#
@Rabius bids you farewell. #npc$$822$1#

7802|#&7$Dufresne##br#
"Is there really treasure hidden in a place like this? #br#
@I wonder if that archaeologist tricked me..." #br#
@Dufresne is murmuring almost inaudibly as he plays with the stone in his hands. #npc$$821$1#|
7803|What's with that stone you got there?|
7804|#&7$Dufresne##br#
"Oh, you mean this? #br#
@We saved an archaeologist, and, in return, he gave us this stone." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dufresne##br#
"He said that in the southern part of the Highland Cemetery #br#
@there's a massive slate. #br#
@He also said that this stone is used to activate some mechanism that leads to hidden treasure! #br#
@He gave it to us as thanks for saving him." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Dufresne##br#
"Since no one else believed him, though, #br#
@the stone ended up with me." #npc$$827$1#

#&7$Dufresne##br#
"Could there really be treasure in a place like that? #br#
@It sounds strange no matter how you phrase it! #br#
@Besides, the monsters out there are all super strong. #br#
@There's no way I'd be able to make it there on my own." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Dufresne##br#
"Argh! #br#
@I don't know what to do! #br#
@...I know! Seeing how you seem so interested in this, #br#
@how about I just give YOU the stone?" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell him you would gladly take the stone. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Dufresne##br#
"Sweet! #br#
@Now it won't cause me anymore trouble. Hah!" #br#
@Dufresne hands you the stone with a big sigh of relief. #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Dufresne##br#
"Remember - it's a massive slate in the southern part of the Highland Cemetery. #br#
@Not that I can say if it really exists or not... You'll have to find out for yourself!" #npc$$821$1#|
7805|#&7$Dufresne##br#
"It's a massive slate in the southern part of the Highland Cemetery. #br#
@Not that I can say if it really exists or not... You'll have to find out for yourself!" #npc$$821$1#|
7806|#&7$%n%##br#
@The slate has been engraved with some kind of #br#
@design, below which are scratched a few sentences. #br#
@You notice a small notch under the slate #br#
@amid several protruding rocks. #npch+99$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You examine the text. It reads: #char$$821$0#

#&7$Ancient Slate##br#
"A long time ago, there were nine suns in the sky, and the world was unbearably hot. #br#
@One day, a hunter set off to shoot down the suns with ten arrows. #br#
@He hit six suns, but two of his arrows did not strike true. #br#
@There were several suns left in the sky, and the hunter did not have arrows for all of them." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@The words almost seem like some kind of riddle. #br#
@You turn your attention to the small notch under the slate amid several protruding rocks. #char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take a closer look at the mysterious stone in your hand. #br#
@It looks to be about the same size as the notch in the slate. Maybe it's a key of sorts! #br#
@Unfortunately, you can't place the stone in the notch because it's blocked by a mechanism. #char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You decide to investigate the protruding rocks. #br#
@There are three rocks in total, each engraved with a unique drawing. #br#
@The three drawings are of a sun, an arrow, and an 'X'. #br#
@What does it all mean? #char$$821$0#|
7807|Place the mysterious stone in the notch on the slate.|
7808|#&7$%n%##br#
@You can't place the stone because the hole is blocked by a mechanism. #npch+99$$821$1#|
7809|Move the rock with the sun symbol on it.|
7810|#&7$%n%##br#
@You press down on the protruding rock with a symbol of a sun on it, #br#
@and something clicks inside. #br#
@Perhaps it activated some mechanism. #npch+99$$821$1#|
7811|Move the rock with an arrow symbol on it.|
7812|#&7$%n%##br#
@You press down on the protruding rock with the symbol of an arrow on it, #br#
@and something clicks inside. #br#
@Perhaps it activated some mechanism. #npch+99$$821$1#|
7813|Move the rock with the 'X' symbol on it.|
7814|#&7$%n%##br#
@You press down on the protruding rock with the X-shaped symbol on it, #br#
@and something clicks inside. #br#
@Perhaps it activated some mechanism. #npch+99$$821$1#|
7815|#&7$Chirudi##br#
"The sky is a stunning cerulean blue with specks of white clouds. #br#
@There's only one true way to capture this natural beauty - #br#
@with these special coloring brushes!" #npc$$821$1#|
7816|What are you doing?|
7817|#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Are you interested in painting? #br#
@I like to paint when I'm not on duty." #npc$$821$1#@

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Right now, I'm drawing a rainbow, #br#
@but I'm fresh out of purple paint. #br#
@It's going to take a long time to find that color." #br#
@Chirudi is calm, but you can hear the disappointment in her voice. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask her if there's anything you can do to help. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Can you find me some paint? #br#
@Wait, I know!  Normally it takes several days for my paint deliveries to arrive here, #br#
@but I just thought of a decent substitute.  Can you get it for me?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You smile graciously and offer Chirudi your help. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"What a good person you are! #br#
@Are you ready for it? The best substitute is... #br#
@Rabius's Healthy Energy Broth! #br#
@Please see if you can get some broth from Rabius.  She should be in the western part of Gwer Village." #npc$$822$1#|
7818|I brought you some of that Healthy Energy Broth. |
7819|#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Yep, this is Healthy Energy Broth, all right. #br#
@I can't believe you actually obtained this stuff. #br#
@"You've been so helpful!  Thank you!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You give Chirudi the Healthy Energy Broth and ask her why she needs this ingredient to make paint. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Well... Rabius is a really nice person, you know? #br#
@She's a good cook, and everything she makes is amazing. #br#
@She's too darn humble about it!" #br#
@Chirudi's tone of voice is defensive, as if she's protecting Rabius. #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Be that as it may, that Healthy Energy Broth of hers is another story. #br#
@If you drink this broth, it'll knock you out for at least ten days. #br#
@Rabius is passionate about her craft, and she loves to cook for other people. #br#
@Because of this, she has acquired several male admirers." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"But so far, everyone who drinks her broth is poisoned, #br#
@and they wind up losing consciousness for as long as two weeks. #br#
@It's scary just thinking about it. #br#
@This is why they call her Healthy Energy Broth the 'killer dish' behind her back." #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Here... check out this deep purple. #br#
@This will make for some lovely paint after further processing, don't you think? #br#
@I can't help but feel a little bad for Rabius, #br#
@but then again, I AM putting her broth to good use." #br#
@Chirudi smiles bashfully. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Chirudi##br#
"Thanks for bringing this back to me." #br#
@Chirudi is evidently excited to try out the new paint. #npc$$821$1#|
7820|#&7$Luce##br#
"Could it be that in this snowy land, #br#
@a hidden treasure lurks in the shadows? #br#
@I love fantasizing about stuff like that... It's soooo romantic!" #npc$$825$1#|
7821|Is there really treasure here? |
7822|#&7$Luce##br#
"Aren't you %n%, the one who helped the Church on more than one occasion? #br#
@It must be fate that I'm meeting with you here." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Luce##br#
"I recently bought a key from a Mysterious Merchant. #br#
@Have you heard of him? He's a strange and elusive merchant #br#
@who travels the land selling curious items." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Luce##br#
"At the time, he told me #br#
@to go to Springwater Valley #br#
@in search of some mysterious treasure. #br#
@I bought a key because my unit just happened to be deploying to the area." #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Luce##br#
"As it turns out, the fierce fighting has us completely preoccupied, #br#
@and I don't have any time for a treasure hunt. #br#
@How would you like to take a look for me?" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take Luce's key and tell her you'll do your best to locate the treasure. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Luce##br#
"The treasure should be somewhere in the southern part of Springwater Valley. #br#
@Please find it and bring it back! #br#
@The thought of hidden treasure is so exciting... #br#
@I can't wait to find out what's inside!" #npc$$822$1#|
7823|#&7$Luce##br#
"The treasure should be somewhere in the southern part of Springwater Valley. #br#
@Please find it and bring it back! #br#
@The thought of hidden treasure is so exciting... #br#
@I can't wait to find out what's inside!" #npc$$822$1#|
7824|I found the treasure! Here you go.|
7825|#&7$Luce##br#
"I-incredible! It's soooo shiny... #br#
@I don't even know what it is, but it's amazing! #br#
@I don't know what you've found, but it's breathtaking!" #br#
@Luce rattles on with all the excitement of a small child. #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Luce##br#
"You're such a decent person... #br#
@I mean, you didn't even claim the treasure for yourself! #br#
@I admire you more and more with every day that passes." #br#
@You hand Luce the shining gem, and she curtseys deeply to signify her gratitude. #npc$$822$1#|
7826|#&7$%n%##br#
@Now that you think about it, it makes sense that in this land of snow, #br#
@a hidden treasure chest would be sealed in ice. #br#
@You wonder what's inside... #br#
@but you're unable to open it - it's locked! #npch+60$$821$1#|
7827|Open the chest with the key. |
7828|#&7$%n%##br#
@You try to open the chest with Luce's key. #br#
@It works! The chest is now unlocked. #br#
@You slowly open it, half-expecting a ghost to appear. #npch+60$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Nothing happens. It seems that ghost really has left this place. #br#
@You find a gem in the chest. #char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Bring it back to Luce! #char$$821$0#|
7829|#&7$%n%##br#
@You try to open the chest with Luce's key. #br#
@It works! The chest is now unlocked. #br#
@As you lift the lid on the chest, a ghost appears out of nowhere! #M202023$Ghost$821$1#

#&7$Ghost##br#
"Halt! Who goes there? Have you come to steal my treasure?!" #br#
@The ghost looks like it's ready to attack. #M202023$Ghost$311$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You calmly ask the ghost why it would be in such a place. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Ghost##br#
"Heeeey... aren't you afraid of me? #br#
@No? You're just going to stand there asking questions? #br#
@You are a strange one, indeed!  #M202023$Ghost$823$1#

#&7$Ghost##br#
"Oh, well. It won't make a difference even if I tell you! #br#
@I was a treasure hunter once - just like you. #br#
@But then? I found this treasure during my adventures." #M202023$Ghost$821$1#

#&7$Ghost##br#
"Around that time, I was caught in a terrible storm, #br#
@and I froze to death in this miserable place. #br#
@My body was lost to the icy gales that carried it away, #br#
@and since my soul has nowhere else to go, I just stay here!" #M202023$Ghost$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You offer the ghost your assistance. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Ghost##br#
"You want to help me, eh? #br#
@All right then - find my body for me! #br#
@There's no telling where exactly the icy gales blew my body, #br#
@but I have a feeling it's somewhere in the eastern part of Springwater Valley." #M202023$Ghost$828$1#

#&7$Ghost##br#
"If you find my body #br#
@and give it a proper burial, #br#
@I might actually be able to leave this place!" #M202023$Ghost$825$1#|
7830|#&7$Reydini##br#
"I traveled the land with Karian, #br#
@performing wherever we went." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reydini##br#
"I actually kind of hate singing, #br#
@especially when performing in front of a large group of people, #br#
@but Karian's enthusiasm has a way of rubbing off on me." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Reydini##br#
"Now, I can say that performing with Karian #br#
@is one of my greatest joys in life." #br#
@Reydini seems genuinely pleased about her newfound role as a performer. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reydini##br#
"Recently, though, Karian came down with a nasty cold, #br#
@and singing gives her a sore throat. #br#
@"She loves to sing so much! I don't know what to do..." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reydini##br#
"If you're not in a hurry, #br#
@why don't you stay for a while and watch our performance?" #br#
@Reydini flashes you a bright smile. #npc$$822$1#|
7831|#&7$Karian##br#
"What do you love doing #br#
@more than anything else? #br#
@For me? It's singing!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"My voice truly has been a blessing. #br#
@Ever since I met Reydini, #br#
@every day has been better than the last. I couldn't be happier! #br#
@Is there something you're passionate about, too?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"I heard that they're fighting vicious monsters out here, #br#
@so we wanted to use our voices #br#
@to renew everyone's courage! #br#
@That's why we applied to come to this place." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"It's a good thing that they accepted our application, too. #br#
@Sure, we have to wear this heavy armor... #br#
@but I think it's a pretty good look!" #br#
@Karian winks at you with a smile to indicate that she's kidding. Well. Sort of. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"We'll do our best - as always! #br#
@I hope you have time to stay and #br#
@listen to our performance one day!" #npc$$822$1#|
7832|Aren't you afraid of this place?|
7833|#&7$Karian##br#
"Don't be silly! Singing is all I need to be happy. #br#
@Yes, it's cold here, and yes, there are scary monsters about, #br#
@but so long as there are people who want to listen to our songs, #br#
@I won't be afraid!" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"Have you ever heard Reydini and me sing? #br#
@How did it make you feel? #br#
@I really hope that it made you happy!" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"Because of an illness... *cough*... I had when I was young, #br#
@my throat starts to hurt whenever I sing for... *cough*... too long. #br#
@I want to keep performing with Reydini, #br#
@but when my throat starts acting up, there's nothing I can do but... *cough*... watch..." #br#
@Karian is clearly unhappy about the situation. #npc$$829$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You ask her if there's anything you can do to help. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Karian##br#
"You want to help me out of the goodness of your heart? Thank you so much - you're very kind! #br#
@"Even though I can't... *cough*... sing, #br#
@I want to stay by Reydini's side." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"When my... *cough*... throat starts hurting I usually... *cough*... take one of Astra's throat lozenges, #br#
@but as it happens, I've run clean out. #br#
@Is there any chance you could get some more from... *cough*... Astra?" #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You agree to help and ask if she is talking about the nurse next to the Traveling Priest. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Karian##br#
"Yes! That's the one! #br#
@She's a really... *cough*... kind person.  She helps dozens of people every day! #br#
@...of course, you're also a good person, haha! I won't forget you, #br#
@and I'm counting on you to heal my... *cough*... sore throat." #npc$$822$1#|
7834|Here are the throat lozenges you wanted.|
7835|#&7$Karian##br#
"Oh, perfect! These are the ones. #br#
@That sweet taste and faint floral fragrance - #br#
@these are unmistakably Astra's unique throat lozenges!" #br#
@You give Karian the lozenges, and she hastily pops another one in her mouth. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"Astra is such a kind-hearted soul. #br#
@She's passionate about helping others, and she's very good at healing people. #br#
@She can even cast powerful healing spells. #br#
@And don't tell anyone, but she's kinda cute, too! I really admire her." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Karian##br#
"You've been a huge help, #br#
@but I don't even know your name! Can you tell me?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You introduce yourself to Karian. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Karian##br#
"Oh! So you're %n%? I've heard so much about you! #br#
@What a privilege to meet someone as powerful as you. #br#
@If you don't mind, I'd like you to stay and watch our performance." #br#
@Karian expresses her thanks with a curtsey, which seems to be a well-practiced gesture for the performer. #npc$$821$1#|
7836|#&7$Mila##br#
"In order to become a great mage like my grandmother, #br#
@I've been studying magic daily. I can already craft a few magical items! #br#
@I'll be the most powerful mage in the world one day!" #npc$$825$1#|
7837|What are you doing here?|
7838|#&7$Mila##br#
"Recently, I came up with a new magical item, #br#
@and I've come here to conduct experiments with it. #br#
@Care to keep me company for a bit, %n%?" #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You look surprised when you realize that Mila knows your name. #char$$823$0#

#&7$Mila##br#
"I've been training every day to become stronger, #br#
@and that involves memorizing all the great people who can change the world. #br#
@One of those people is you, %n%... #br#
@even though you might not be aware of it." #npc$$825$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Ahem. I recently made a magical item called the Photography Crystal. #br#
@Once you set up the crystal, it takes pictures of its surroundings, #br#
@which you can send to me over here.  Pretty amazing, don't you agree?" #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"I want to use the Photography Crystal to monitor the movements of the skeletons nearby, #br#
@but I can't leave right now because I'm in the middle of forming a Magic Circle. #br#
@Can you set up three Photography Crystals around Beastbone Plain for me? #br#
@Your help would be most appreciated." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod in agreement, and Mila hands you her Photography Crystal. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Why, you're every bit as charitable as people claim! #br#
@It's simple, then. #br#
@I promise that after you set up the crystals and come back to me, #br#
@I'll observe the results with you." #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"The locations are written on the Photography Crystals. #br#
@Just set them up at the marked locations. #br#
@Good luck! In the meantime, I'll continue working on my Magic Circle." #npc$$824$1#|
7839|Speak to Mila about the Photography Crystals.|
7840|#&7$Mila##br#
"Wow, you set them up so quickly! #br#
@I guess I should have expected nothing less from the great %n%!" #br#
@Mila blushes at her own words, then tries to play it off. #npc$$824$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Okay, let's get down to business. #br#
@Come check out the images with me!" #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Hmm... #br#
@The images are very clear. #br#
@We should be able to use these crystals to monitor the skeletons' movements." #br#
@Mila looks long and hard at the images in the Magic Circle. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Hmm... I can't shake the feeling that something is still missing. #br#
@I wonder what it could be..." #br#
@Mila is concentrating again. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"I know! The recorded images aren't QUITE in-sync with the current time. #br#
@They lag slightly, which means they can only record the past. #br#
@It'd be hard to use this for real-time monitoring. Looks like it still needs some improvement." #br#
@Mila is concentrating again. #npc$$828$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Ah, excuse me. I don't mean to be rude,  I was just so focused on my thoughts that I almost forgot about you! #br#
@Thank you for assisting me with this experiment, #br#
@but now I need to think things through some more. #br#
@Don't let me detain you. Truly, though... thank you, %n%." #npc$$822$1#|
7841|#&7$Mila##br#
"The Photography Crystal is a magical item I made recently. #br#
@Once you set up the crystal, it takes pictures of its surroundings #br#
@and sends them here to me.  Pretty amazing, isn't it?" #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Unfortunately, I can't leave right now as I'm in the middle of forming a Magic Circle. #br#
@I was hoping that someone could set up the Photography Crystals at three different locations for me." #npc$$822$1#|
7842|#&7$Mila##br#
"What is it, %n%? #br#
@Are you here to play with me? #br#
@Sorry, I'm busy preparing lunch right now." #npc$$824$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You explain to Mila that dinner won't be served tonight because the chef and several cooks are exhausted. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Mila##br#
"What? How could this happen? #br#
@Being in the army is a tough gig. #br#
@Hm... so you need to find some people to help you cook dinner, is that it?" #npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod and ask Mila if she can help out. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Mila##br#
"But of course! #br#
@Actually, you came at just the right time. #br#
@I accidently cooked too much food, #br#
@and I was trying to figure out what to do with it!" #npc$$826$1#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Since you were coming here for a visit, #br#
@I figured we'd have lunch together, #br#
@but I guess you'd rather give the food to the army, am I right?" #npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You agree - the army needs the food more than you. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Mila##br#
"I thought so. #br#
@Let me give you this special kind of fruit. #br#
@It's known only as Vitality Fruit. It's sure to boost their spirits! #br#
@Quickly - take it to the troops!" #br#
@Mila gives you a batch of refreshing Vitality Fruit. #npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You take the strange fruit and thank Mila for her support. #char$$821$0#

#&7$Mila##br#
"Don't thank me. I'm just giving you some of my excess food. #br#
@Then again... if you really want to thank me, #br#
@why don't you have lunch with me next time you're in the area! #br#
@It's quite boring always being here by myself..." #br#
@Mila smiles awkwardly - she's clearly busy, but too polite to say as such. You take the hint and head out. #npc$$825$1#|
7843|Tell her about the food shortage for tonight's dinner and ask her for help.|
7844|#&7$%n%##br#
@Mila already gave you her excess food. #br#
@Get all the food you need and take it to Potter! #char$$821$0#|
7845|#&7$Potter##br#
"The soldiers here fight for everyone's safety, #br#
@and it's our job to make sure they get their three meals a day." #npc$$822$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Eating rich, nourishing food #br#
@always leaves me feeling happy and satisfied. #br#
@%n%, don't you feel the same way?" #npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Crikey! We don't have enough food for tonight. #br#
@What can we do...?" #npc$$828$1#|
7869|#&7$Gus##br#
"The resources here are in short supply - even more so than I thought! #br#

@I can rest a little easier." #npc$$1$1#|

"When I was training at the Ministry of Magic, I couldn't wait to head out into a real battle. #br#
@But now that I can finally use what I've learned, #br#
@I don't feel happy at all... #br#
@All I see is the cruelty of war." #npc$$1$1#|
7874|#&7$Cinda##br#
"As an investigator, #br#
@having a short, small stature is a huge advantage. #br#
@We can run faster, and it makes it easier for us to hide. #br#
@It's harder for our enemies to discover us!" #M050071s85h+70$Cinda$1$1#|
7875|#&7$Ronny##br#
"It takes a lot of courage to face demons. #br#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Well, it's like this -#br#
@we have a manpower shortage, so everyone is spread too thin.#br#
@Even the kitchen staff hasn't been spared."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"The nurse said that the kitchen staff should be fine#br#
@after a full day's rest,#br#
@but tonight's dinner isn't ready. I'm not sure what to do."#npc$$828$1#

@You tell Potter that you'll come up with something.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Are you sure you can help us out?#br#
@You're already pretty busy, and#br#
@I'd hate to bother you with dinner, too."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"How about this -#br#
@I can't leave my post,#br#
@but perhaps you could ask around and find us some food.#br#
@Maybe we can still collect enough ingredients to finish dinner on time."#npc$$826$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod in agreement.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"I have a few connections#br#
@who might be able to help.#br#
@Our fate is in your hands. Don't let us starve, %n%!"#br#

7900|#&7$Potter##br#
"Amazing! I can't believe there are so many kind-hearted#br#
@people out there willing to share their food with us.#br#
@It's truly inspiring."#br#
@Potter thanks you as you hand him the food.#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Now then, what have we here?#br#
@Hmm... How curious...#br#
@It appears to be a regular apple pie, but it's simply radiating with warmth and love.#br#
@It's... it's... so beautiful. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes. It's so good, it warms the stomach AND the heart!"#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
"That pie looks great. I can hardly wait for dinner!#br#
@And what's this? What a strange-looking fruit.#br#
@Wait a second... is this Vitality Fruit? Where did you get this?#br#
@Can we really share such a rare delicacy with everyone?"#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Potter about getting the Vitality Fruit from Mila.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"I never expected you'd bring back something so exquisite.#br#
@You must be pretty popular, %n%.#br#
@Let's take a look at your last item. It's... a drink?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Potter about Daybreak's Splendor.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Potter##br#
"Who would've thought that Rabius, who always makes that awful Healthy Energy Broth,#br#
@could actually be GOOD at cooking?#br#
@It seems I asked the right person for help.#br#
@It's all thanks to you we managed to get such great food!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Potter##br#
 "It may not seem like a lot,#br#

@Thank you, %n%."#npc$$822$1#|

@There are a lot of evil creatures around here.#br#
@I won't allow them to hurt my mother or anyone else!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Reneya##br#
"Our old friend the bluebird#br#
@accompanied us to this place.#br#
@But when I woke up today, it was gone.#br#
@What should I do?"#npc$$829$1#|
7903|I can try to find the bluebird for you.|
7904|#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Reneya to stop worrying and that you'll help her find her bird.#npc$$829$1#

#&7$Reneya##br#
"Are you serious? That's fantastic!#br#
@I'll be on duty soon, and I won't be able to leave my post.#br#
@I wasn't sure what to do.
@Are you really certain you can spare the time?"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod and ask her for clues.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Reneya##br#
"I talked to some of the people around here this morning.#br#
@They said they saw a bluebird flying towards the northern part of Beastbone Plain.#br#
@I'm worried our bird might be in danger.#br#
@Please investigate as soon as you can!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You assure Reneya you'll look into it and that she can focus on her duties.#char$$821$0#

"Wonderful, thank you! I'll be here waiting for you.#br#
@I've heard there are dangerous creatures out there.#br#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"I was out making my usual rounds,#br#
@and I came across a bird that had been injured.#br#
@What should I do? I'm not equipped to take care of a small animal."#npc$$828$1#|
7907|What are you doing here?|
7908|#&7$%n%##br#
@You see Lovelow grilling meat over a fire,#br#
@and your rush over to him to ask what he's doing.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"I...  I'm just making some food. Why? What's the matter?"#br#
@Lovelow is frightened by the look on your face.#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You tell Lovelow that Reneya is looking for a bluebird.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"Captain Reneya? A bluebird?#br#
@Wait a minute... Oh, my! Oh, oh, my! You're mistaken. Truly!#br#
@I found a bluebird, but I didn't cook it!#br#
@It was injured, and I thought a bit of sustenance might help it."#npc$$823$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@Lovelow's story surprises you, and you ask him to continue.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"I was out making my rounds this morning, and I came across a bluebird.#br#
@It appeared to be injured pretty badly,#br#
@so I took it with me."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"I didn't know what to do for it,#br#
@but I thought it might recover some strength if it ate something."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"But I have no idea what bluebirds eat!#br#
@I like meat, so I thought maybe it would enjoy some meat too. That's why I'm grilling meat.#br#
@If you don't believe me, take a look at this cage!"#br#
@says Lovelow, pointing at the iron cage next to him.#npc$$825$1#
|
7909|#&7$Lovelow##br#
"What's wrong with the little birdie?#br#
@It looks pretty badly injured.#br#
@Should we feed it something?#br#
@What should we do?"#npc$$828$1#|
7910|Discuss the birdcage with Lovelow.|
7911|#&7$%n%##br#
@You apologize to Lovelow#br#
@about the misunderstanding. You let him know that Reneya is looking for a bluebird.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"Ah, no problem. I can imagine anyone might get the wrong idea from that picture!#br#
@Did you say Captain Reneya was looking for this bird?#br#
@Then this must be Reneya's treasured pet we've all heard so much about.#br#
@What should we do? Do you think it can survive?"#npc$$828$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You shake your head gravely, indicating that it doesn't look good. You tell Lovelow about the possibility of bringing the bluebird to a nurse.#char$$821$0#

#&7$Lovelow##br#
"Hm, a nurse, a nurse... Wait, I know! Go see Astra!#br#
@She might be able to do something.#br#
@Can you take the bluebird to her? She's right next to the Traveling Priest.#br#
@I have to stay on patrol, so I can't accompany you."#npc$$825$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@You nod and remove the bluebird from the cage,#br#
@then set off to see the nurse in Gwer Village.#char$$821$0#|

@Straining your eyes, you can barely make out an injured bird hiding in the corner.#br#
@This might be the bluebird Reneya is seeking!#npcs40h+99$$821$1#

#&7$%n%##br#
@As you feared, the bluebird is severely injured.#br#
@Before you bring it back to Reneya,#br#
@you should try to find a way to heal its wounds.#br#
@The nurse in Gwer Village might be able to do something.#char$$821$0#

#&7$%n%##br#
@It appears you were mistaken about Lovelow.#br#
@Before you take the bluebird away,#br#

#&7$Shay##br#
"After that, our tribe began to splinter into warring factions.#br#

90578|Else we too shall be punished! If you hear anything, go after it!|
90579|That was too close... If that spell hits anyone, it'll spell the end for them.|

@the next wave of monsters comes through."#npc$$821$1#|
90594|#&7$Erika##br#
"I'm not fully confident I can pull off this spell,#br#
@but just thinking about the hordes of monsters coming through the portal...#br#
@I know, I don't have a choice.#br#
@Please protect me while I cast the spell."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"Tell me if you're ready.#br#
@I can do it."#npc$$821$1#|
90595|Destroying the portal.|
90596|Let's get started.|
90597|#&7$Erika##br#
"The evil energy emanating from this portal is making the monsters nearby all the more vicious.#br#
@Hurting them with ordinary attacks is going to be difficult.#br#
@This spell is our only hope to both destroy the portal and defeat these monsters."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"The magic circle generated when summoning the Shaped Flame Spirit will give you power.#br#
@Only with the power of the Shaped Flame Spirit can we hope to defeat those monsters.#br#
@The fires of the Fire Spirit can burn away all evil.#br#
@It's what these monsters fear the most."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Erika##br#
"I should add, you will only be able to use the power of the Fire Spirit as long as you are within the confines of the magic circle.#br#
@As soon as you stray outside, the power will instantly dissipate.#br#
@It takes time for the energy accumulation spell to take effect. During that time, you must protect me."#npc$$821$1#|
90598|#&7$Erika##br#
"Then let's begin.#br#
@Please protect me while I cast the spell."#npc$$821$1#|
90599|Are you ok? What's the matter?|
90600|Then get ready to destroy the portal.|
90601|Once I open the magic circle, you'll gain the power of the Fire Spirit.|
90602|You can use this power to defeat monsters, but the power will dissipate once you leave the circle.|
90603|Please protect me while the energy is accumulating. Don't let the monsters interrupt the ritual.|
90604|We succeeded. Let's rendezvous with the Eldest Prince and the others.|
90605|Don't you get lonely here all by yourself?|
90606|Give me a little time...|
95040|It was tough, but we're finally in. Next... we'll investigate why the magnetic field in this place is so strange.|
95041|So... could it have something to do with that coffin? Let's take a closer look.|
95042|Hmm... You say you saw this coffin in a vision...|
95043|It's slightly different from the one you described, though... This one is empty!|
95044|Who's there? Ah, it's you. I haven't seen you for a few days.|
95045|I remember! You're always showing up in places you shouldn't be.|
95046|Hehehehe. I don't know how you found this place, and I don't really care. After all... you will never leave!|
95047|This is the stage upon which we will perform the final act of your life!|
95048|Hmm... An impressive performance indeed. I underestimated you.|
95049|Seems like it's time to fight for real, then. Can't go too easy on you!|
95050|Lord Von, everything is ready. We should leave.|
95051|Aaaah, so lucky. Wouldn't you say?|
95052|Treasure them. Treasure your last moments, before your lives come to an end.|
95053|Whew... Thankfully, you were here. I don't dare imagine what would have happened otherwise!|
95054| That's great! It looks like your force field has made short work of those Frost Breaths!|
95055|No... It looks like your force field is being weakened!|
95056|Oh? You need to increase the power a little!|
95057|Hehe! Your end is near!|
95058|Yeah! Your force field is stronger!|
95059|Those Frost Breaths are getting close again! Hold on!|
95060| Hmph! I can't believe they tried to resist!|
95061|Is that all you've got?|
95062|Let's get out of here first. We can talk about the rest later.|
95063|Amazing! You eliminated all the Frost Breaths!|
95064|Are you a follower of the Shadow Knight? No, stay away.|
95065|What do you want with us?|

"Card Duel is an involved, intricate game.#br#
@It's the new sensation sweeping the Great Land,"#br#
@Simone explains gleefully.#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Here's how you play.#br#
@Both sides group five cards into a set.#br#
@After confirming the Card Deck, the battle will begin."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"You can choose the level when you battle with the residents of each region.#br#
@The Cards' levels of abilities determine the result of the battle.#br#
@Cards can be used against one another, too - you've got to play your cards right to defeat your opponent."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Here's how it works: lightning battles ice; ice battles flame;#br#
@flame battles wind; wind battles lightning; and light and dark oppose one another.#br#
@These attributes work against each other." #npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"If you use the Card Deck with the element that opposes your opponent's Car Deck,#br#
@your win will come more easily.#br#
@Otherwise, you might fall into a bitter battle."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Cards are like forts; use them to prevent your foe's attack.#br#
@When a card at a certain position is destroyed,#br#
@the cards will directly attack the enemy#br#
@and reduce the enemy's HP."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Destroyed cards will recover after an allotted time#br#
@and will continue to fight on the table!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"%n%, you appear to be quite skilled indeed.#br#
@I think a Card Duel will be right up your alley."#npc$$824$1#

"You can attempt a duel with my companion, Izzy.#br#
@"She may be a lady,#br#
@but she won't hesitate to beat you mercilessly."#npc$$1$1#

"But I'm stronger than her.#br#

"Get your card deck ready and go find Izzy.#br#
@I await news of your impending victories!"#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Ah, but there's still one matter we haven't discussed. If you lose your Card Deck due to foolish play,#br#
@Izzy can provide you the basic cards.#br#
@you'll need to pay for it.#br#
@It's best to take good care of your Card Deck."#npc$$821$1#|
22362|#&7$Simone##br#

@You tell Simone you've won twice.#char$$821:0$0#

"How exciting!#br#
@As a member of the AK Card Association,#br#
@it's my pleasure to give you this reward, provided by the Association, of course."#npc$$822$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Please continue working to improve your card skills."#br#
@Simone presents you with the reward, grinning.#npc$$821$1#|
22374|Simone thought the best way to improve your Card Duel skills was to engage in more battles. He asked you to find two people with which you could have a General Duel.|
22381|#&7$Simone##br#
"To strengthen your cards,#br#
@besides enhancing them frequently,#br#
@you'll need to battle with others."#npc$$821$1#

@it shouldn't be a problem." #npc$$824$1#

@We hope you continue to do battle.#br#
@Only you can create your own legend."#br#
@Simone presents you with the reward, a grin plastered on his face.#npc$$1$1#|
22384|Simone believed you could win four times, so he asked you to find opponents with which to engage in General Duels.|
22391|#&7$Simone##br#
"The difference between Random Duels and General Duels#br#
@is that a Random Duel is a battle between Envoys of Gaia.#br#
@If you're not an Envoy of Gaia,#br#
@you cannot participate in this high level battle."#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"%n%, to become more skilled,#br#
@please battle with other Envoys of Gaia."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"If you emerge victorious twice,#br#
@you'll receive a special reward provided by our Association.#br#

@Simone thinks for a moment.#npc$$821$1#|

@Simone says admiringly.#npc$$825$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"The AK Card Association deems you worthy of this reward.#br#
@I think you'll find it very useful indeed."#br#
@Simone presents you with the reward happily.#npc$$1$1#|
22394|Simone encouraged you to have Random Duels with other Envoys of Gaia; he insisted that you needed to win twice.|
22401|#&7$Simone##br#
"Challenging others is a good way to improve your skills,#br#
@particularly when your opponent is an Envoy of Gaia.#br#
@I bet you've improved vastly!"#npc$$821$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"To continue on your journey,#br#
@you must again engage in battle with Envoys of Gaia."#npc$$1$1#

#&7$Simone##br#
"Please win four times in Random Duels.#br#
@If you can accomplish such a lofty goal,#br#
@our Association will reward your efforts."#npc$$1$1#|
22402|#&7$Simone##br#
"Beating Envoys of Gaia in battles#br#
